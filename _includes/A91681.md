Though I foul my Mouth, Ile be content,

To ſing of the Rump of a Parliament,

And a man may imagine the Rump of a Lowſe;

And a Rump whoſe Neck was hang'd in a Nooſe;

Two ſhort years together we Engliſh have ſcarce

Been rid of thy rampant Noſe (Old Mars)

But now thou haſt got a prodigious Arſe,

When the parts of the Body did all fall out,

Some votes it is like did paſs for the Snout;

But that the Rump ſhould be King was never a doubt,

Which no body can deny.

A Cat has a Rump, and a Cat has nine Lives,

Yet when her heads off, her Rump never ſtrives;

But our Rump from the grave hath made two Retrives,

Which no body can deny.

That the Rump may all their Enemies quail,

They'l borrow the Devils Coat of Mayl,

And all to defend their Eſtate in Tayl,

VVhich no body can deny.

There's no need of the charge of a Thankſgiving ſupper,

For if they be the Rump, the Army's their Crupper,

Which is good, although it be worn to the Stump,

That on the Buttocks Ile give thee a Thump

VVhich no body can deny.

Which hath in it more of Sence than of Art,

That for all you can do, I care not a Fart,

VVhich no body can deny.

But Alderman Atkins made it a Jeſt,

That of all kind of Lucks, ſhitten Luck is the beſt,

That the good the Rump will do when they prevail,

Is to give us a Flop with a Fox-tail,

Which without an Onion will make me to weep;

That Flyes will blow Maggots in the Rump of a Sheep,

Say this Sanctify'd Rump in time we may leeſe;

For the Cooks do challenge the Rumps for their Fees.

When the Rump do ſit we will make it our Moane,

That a reaſon be 'nacted if there be not one,

Why a Fart hath a Tongue, and a Fyeſt hath none?

Which no body can deny.

And whil'ſt within the Walls they Lurk,

To ſatisfy us, will be a good work;

Who hath moſt Religion, the Rump, or the Turk,

Which no body can deny.

A Rump's a Fag-end, like the Baulk of a Furrow,

And is to the whole like the Jayl to the Burrough;

T'is the Bran that is left, when the Meal is run thorough

Which no body can deny.

Conſider the World, the Heav'n is the head on't,

The Earth is the middle, and we men are fed on't;

But Hell is the Rump, and no more can be ſed on't.

VVhich no body can deny.

Flectere ſi nequeunt ſuperos Achaeronta movebunt.
