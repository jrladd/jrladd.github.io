OF late I did hear a young man domineer,

Plow and vapour of what he could do

But I think he knew how for ſo manage the

far better then maidens to woe brave boys

far better &c.

And he ſurely doth think that we maidens are mad

for to mind ev'ry Clown we do ſée

Should his Love be expreſt, with a vow & pro­teſt

i'de believe no ſuch boobies as he brave

ide &c.

Though his bottles of Ale & other fine things

he beſtows on me ev'ry day

It is my intent when his money is ſpent

to bid him begone & away brave boys

to bid, &c.

Ile give him good words while his money doth laſt

and tell him I dearly do love him

When his caſh is all gone, ile tell him my man John

ther's others I fancy above him brave

And that which is worſe, when once they do find

a maidens poor heart it is won

They'l laugh & they'l jeer, they'l giggle & ſneer

that they this poor maid hath undone brave

that &c.

Some men they love for what they can get

& tis certain ther's many a Lubbard

Will ſigh & will pant, ſeeming ready to faint

& all for the love of the Cubbard, brave boys

& all &c.

And others ſo long as they think a poor maid

has been careful and ſaved ſome money

This maiden will find he will prove very kind

& call her his joy & his honey brave boys

and &c.

Yea if this poor ſoul will be ſuch a fooll

to hearken to this fellows tale

Shee'l to poverty fall, he'l beguile her of all

ſhe hath got by the merry milk pail brave boys

And ſhe that doth carry the merry milk pall

and delights for to milk the brown Cow

May ſure be as good, be it well underſtood

as the Looby that follows the Plow brave

as the &c.

Yet each pittiful clown will boaſt up & down

of the maidens that he hath betrayd

If all were like me, ſuch things ſhould not be

nor ever hereafter be ſaid, brave boys

nor &c.

Keep but at a diſtance, and then they will be

like men quite bereaved of ſence

Then the beſt of them all into paſſion will fall

& be ready to dye for a wench brave boys

and &c.

Tho ſome of them now, do ſay they know how

to make any mayden to yield

But I would defie any man that ſhould try

in the midſt of the merry Broom field brave

in &c.

For my modeſty ſhall defend me from all

that ſay tis ſo eaſy to win

The poor virgins ſort, of which they make ſport

& delight in this treacherous ſin brave boys

and &c.

Then maidens beware, of ſuch villains take care

whoſe delight is your abſolute ruine

If they conquer with eaſe & gain what they pleaſe

theyl ſoon be [...] weary of wooing brave boys

But if you ſtand off and at them do ſcoff

youl find they will burn like a fire

When you make them to bow, let your reaſon know how

to grant then the thing they deſire brave

to grant &c.

Then take my advice you maids that are free

ile aſſure you I ſpeak not in jeſt,

Ne'r play with the dart till you yoyſon your heart

for a ſingle life it is the beſt brave

for &c.

Thers ſome that are married before they had wit

that with ſorrows are ſorely appreſt

Then think it not ſtrange, I am not for a change

for a ſingle life it is the beſt brave boys

for &c.
