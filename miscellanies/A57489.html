As you were no Stranger to that Excellent Person, whose Pieces Composes, by far, the most valuable part of it, so I was satisfied that every thing, from so celebrated a Hand, wou'd be acceptable and welcome to you; and in that Confi­dence, made bold to give you the Trouble of <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>his Address. My Lord <span class="hi">Rochester</span> has left <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o established a Reputation behind him, that he needs no officious Pen to set out his Worth, especially to you, who were acquainted so per­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ectly well with all his Eminent Qualities, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>hat made him the Delight and Envy of both Sexes, and the Ornament of our Island. In every thing of his Lordship's writing, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e478"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> there's something so happily express'd, the Graces are so numerous, yet so unaffected, that I don't wonder why all the Original Touches of so incomparable a Master, have been enquired after, with so Publick and General a Concern. Most of his other Com­positions, especially those in Verse, have long ago bless'd the Publick, and were received with Vniversal Delight and Admiration, which gives me Encouragement to believe, that his Letters will find the like Reception. Tho' most of them were written upon pri­vate Occasions, to an Honourable Person who was happy in his Lordship's Acquain­tance, with no intention to be ever made publick; yet that constant good Sence, which is all along visible in them, the Iustice of the Observations, and the peculiar Beauties of the Style, are Reasons sufficient, why they should no longer be conceal'd in private Hands. And indeed, at this time, when the private Plate of the Nation comes a­broad to relieve the present Exigences, it seems but just, that since the Dearth of Wit<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> is as great as that of Money, such a Trea­sure of good Sence and Language shou'd no longer be buried in Oblivion. With thi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> difference, however, That whereas our Plate before it can circulate in our Markets, mus<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e504"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> receive the Royal Stamp, must be melted down, and take another Form, these Vnva­luable Remains want no Alterations to re­commend them; they need only be taken from the Rich Mines where they grew; for their own Intrinsick Value secures them, and his Lordship's Name is sufficient to make them Current.</p><p>As for the Letters by other Hands, that make up this Volume, some of them were written by Gentlemen, that are wholly Stran­gers to me, and others belong to those that are so much better known in the World than myself, that I can say nothing upon this Oc­casion, but what falls vastly short of their Merit. But I cannot forbear to say some­thing of Mr. <span class="hi">Otway</span>'s: They have that In­imitable Tenderness in them, that I dare op­pose them to any thing of Antiquity; I am sure few of the present Age can pretend to come up to them. The Passions, in the rai­sing of which, he had a Felicity peculiar to himself, are represented in such lively Co­lours, that they cannot fail of affecting the most insensible Hearts, with pleasing Agi­tations. I cou'd wish we had more Pieces of<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> the same Hand, for I profess an intire Veneration to his Memory, and always look­ed upon him as the only Person, almost, that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e539"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> knew the secret Springs and Sources of Na­ture, and made a true use of them. Love, as it is generally managed by other Hands, is either raving and enthusiastical, or else dull and languishing: In him alone 'tis true Na­ture, and at the same time inspires us with Compassion and Delight. After this, I will not venture to say any thing of my own Trifles that bring up the Rear. Some of 'em were written long ago, and now huddled in haste; the rest had a little more Care and Labour bestow'd upon them. If they contri­bute in the least to your Entertainment, which was my only Design in publishing them, I have attain'd my Ends: I have some others by me, which I may, perhaps, publish hereafter, if these meet with any to­lerable Success.</p><p>I need not, and I am sure I cannot make you a better Panegyrick than to acquaint the World, that you were happy in my Lord <span class="hi">Rochester</span>'s Friendship, that he took plea­sure in your Conversation, of which even his Enemies must allow him to have been the best Iudge, and that in the Politest Reign we can boast of in <span class="hi">England.</span> The Appro­bation of so impartial a Iudge, who was, in his Time, a Scourge to all Blockheads, by what Names or Titles soever dignisied, or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e561"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> distinguish'd, is above all the Incense that a much better Hand than mine can presume to offer: Shou'd I put out all the Dedica­tion Sails, as 'tis the way of most Authors, I cou'd soon erect you into a great Hero, and Deliverer; and tell how often you have triumph'd over inveterate Distempers, and restor'd the Sick to that only Blessing, that makes Life supportable. I cou'd tell how, by your single Merit, you have ba<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>led a Faction form'd against you with equal Ma­lice and Ignorance; I cou'd tell what Marks of Munisicence you have left behind you, in the Place that was honour'd with your Edu­cation, and how generously ready you are to serve your Friends upon all Occasions. But after all, the highest thing I will pretend to say of you her is, That you were esteem'd, and valu'd, and lov'd by my Lord <span class="hi">Rochester.</span> 'Tis true, as there never was any Conspicuous Merit in the World, that had not, like <span class="hi">Her­cules,</span> Monsters to encounter, so you have had your share of them; but, Heaven be prais'd, your Enemies, with all their vain Endea­vours, have only served to six your Interest, and advance your Reputation: Tho' I know you hear of nothing with more Vneasiness, than of the Favours you do; yet I cannot omit to tell, and indeed I am vain upon it, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e585"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> that you have condescended so low, as to di­vert those Hours you cou'd steal from the Publick, with some of my Trifles, that you have been pleased to think favourably of them, and rewarded them. For all which Obligations, I had no other way of expressing my Gratitude but this; which, I am afraid will but inflame the Reckoning, instead of paying any part of the Debt: But this has been the constant Vsage in all Ages of <span class="hi">Par­nassus,</span> and, like Senators that take Bribes, we have Antiquity and Vniversality to plead in our Excuse. But I forget that you are all this while in pain, till the Dedication re­leases you: Therefore I have nothing but my Wishes to add, That you, who have been so happy a Restorer of Health to others, may ever enjoy it yourself, that your Days may be always pleasant, and your Nights easie, and that you'll be pleas'd to forgive this Presumption in</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your most humble and most obliged Servant, <span class="hi">T.

I may say the same of Mr. <span class="hi">Ot­way</span>'s Letters, that they are full of Life and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e635"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> Passion, and sufficiently discover their Author. And that this Collection might be compleat, I got some that were writ­ten by the Fam'd <span class="hi">Orinda,</span> Mrs. <span class="hi">Katherine Phillips,</span> to be added to the rest; together with others by some Gentlemen now li­ving, that the Reader might have a Va­riety of Entertainment.</p><p>Our Neighbouring Nations, whom I don't believe we come short of in any re­spect, have printed several Volumes of Letters, which meet with publick Ap­probation; I am satisfied, that if the Gen­tlemen of <span class="hi">England</span> wou'd be as free, and Communicative to part with theirs, we might show as great a Number, and as good a Choice as they have done. It has been used as an Objection against pub­lishing things of this Nature, That, if they are written as they ought to be, they shou'd never be made publick. But I hope this Collection will disarm that Ob­jection; for tho' the Reader may not un­derstand every particular Passage, yet there are other things in them that will make him sufficient Amends.</p><p>I have only a word more to add: Up­on the Noise of this Collection, several Gentlemen have been so kind, as to send <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e672"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> me in Materials to compose a Second, which is now printed; and, on the Print­ing the Second, I have procured as many of the Lord <span class="hi">Rochester</span>'s the Duke of <span class="hi">Buck­ingham,</span> and Sir <span class="hi">George Etheridge,</span> which will almost make a third Vol. which if I can compleat, it shall be publish'd next <span class="hi">Trinity-Term</span>; and therefore those Gen­tlemen that have any Curious Letters by them, written by those Honourable Per­sons, and are willing to oblige the Pub­lick, by letting them come abroad, are desired to send them to me, who will take care to have them faithfully Tran­scrib'd for the Press, and Printed in the third Vol. which will be intirely theirs, and no modern one mixt with them.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">SAM.

Ah! no; better is a Life among Strangers, than in my own Country upon such Conditions. Whil'st I live, I will endeavour to preserve my Liberty; or, at least, not consent to the destroying of it. I hope I shall die in the same Principle in which I have lived, and will live no longer than they can preserve me. I have in my Life been guilty of many Follies, but, as I think of no meanness, I will not blot and defile that which is past, by endeavouring to provide for the future. I have ever had in my Mind, that when God should cast me into such a Condition, as that I can­not save my Life, but by doing an inde­cent thing, He shews me the time is come wherein I should resign it. And when I cannot live in my own Country, but by such means as are worse than dy­ing in it, I think He shews me, I ought to keep myself out of it.

I love you, I dote on you; Desire makes me mad, when I am near you; and Despair, when I am from you. Sure, of all Miseries, Love is to me the most intolerable; it haunts me in my Sleep, perplexes me when waking; every me­lancholly Thought makes my Fears more powerful; and every delightful one makes my Wishes more unruly. In all other Uneasie Chances of a Man's Life, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4215"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=45">[Page 74]</a></span> there is an immediate Recourse to some kind of Succour or another: in Wants, we apply ourselves to our Friends; in Sickness, to Physicians: but Love, the Sum, the Total of all Misfortunes, must be endur'd with Silence, no Friend so dear to trust with such a Secret, nor Remedy in Art so powerful, to remove its Anguish. Since the first Day I saw you, I have hardly enjoy'd one Hour of per­fect Quiet: I lov'd you early; and no sooner had I beheld that soft bewitching Face of yours, but I felt in my Heart the very Foundation of all my Peace give way: But when you became ano­thers, I must confess, that I did then rebel, had foolish Pride enough to pro­mise myself, I would in time recover my Liberty: In spight of my enslav'd Nature, I swore against myself, I would not love you: I affected a Resentment, stifled my Spirit, and would not let it bend, so much as once to upbraid you, each Day it was my chance to see or to be near you: With stubborn Sufferance I resolv'd to bear and brave your Power; nay, did it often too, successfully, Ge­nerally with Wine or Conversation I di­verted or appeas'd the <span class="hi">Daemon</span> that pos­sess'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4233"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=45">[Page 75]</a></span> me; but when at Night, return­ing to my unhappy self, to give my Heart an account why I had done it so unna­tural a Violence, it was then I always paid a treble Interest for the short Mo­ments of Ease which I had borrow'd; then every treacherous Thought rose up, and took your part, nor left me till they had thrown me on my Bed, and open'd those Sluces of Tears that were to run till Morning. This has been for some Years my best Condition: Nay, Time itself, that decays all things else, has but encreas'd and added to my Longings. I tell it you, and charge you to believe it as you are generous, (which sure you must be, for every thing except your Neglect of me, perswades me that you are so) even at this time, tho' other Arms have held you, and so long trespass'd on those dear Joys that only were my Due; I love you with that tenderness of Spi­rit, that purity of Truth, and that since­rity of Heart, that I could sacrifice the nearest Friends or Interests I have on Earth, barely but to please you: If I had all the World, it should be yours; for with it I could be but miserable, if you were not mine.

Your Com­mands have been always sacred to me; your Smiles have always transported me, and your Frowns aw'd me. In short, you will quickly become to me the greatest Blessing, or the greatest Curse, that ever Man was doom'd to. I cannot so much as look on you without Confusion; Wishes and Fears rise up in War within me, and work a curs'd Distraction through my Soul, that must, I am sure, in time have wretched Consequences: You only can, with that healing Cordial, Love, asswage and calm my Torments; pity the Man then that would be proud to die for you, and cannot live without you, and allow him thus far to boast too, that (take out Fortune from the Ballance) you never were belov'd or courted by a Creature that had a nobler or juster Pretence to your Heart, than the Unfortunate and (even at this time) Weeping</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">OTWAY.</div></div></div></div><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4258"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=46">[Page 77]</a></div><h1>To Madam —</h1><p>IN value of your Quiet, tho' it would be the utter ruine of my own, I have endeavoured this Day to perswade myself never more to trouble you with a Passion that has tormented me sufficiently alrea­dy, and is so much the more a Torment to me, in that I perceive it is become one to you, who are much dearer to me than my self. I have laid all the Reasons my di­stracted Condition would let me have re­course to, before me: I have consulted my Pride, whether a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ter a Rival's Posses­sion I ought to ruine all my Peace for a Woman that another has been more blest in, tho' no Man ever loved as I did: But Love, victorious Love, o'erthrows all that, and tells me, it is his Nature never to re­member; he still looks forward from the present Hour<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> expecting still new Dawns, new rising Happiness, never looks back, never regards what is past, and left behind him, but buries and forgets it quite in the hot fierce pursuit of Joy before him: I <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4282"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=47">[Page 78]</a></span> have consulted too my very self, and find how careless Nature was in framing me; seasoned me hastily with all the most vio­lent Inclinations and Desires, but omitted the Ornaments that should make those Qualities become me: I have consulted too my Lot of Fortune, and find how foolishly I wish possession of what is so precious, all the World's too cheap for it; yet still I Love, still I dote on, and cheat myself, very content because the Folly pleases me. It is Pleasure to think how Fair you are, tho' at the same time worse than Damnation, to think how Cruel: Why should you tell me you have shut your Heart up for ever? It is an Argu­ment unworthy of yourself, sounds like Reserve, and not so much Sincerity, as sure I may claim even from a little of your Friendship. Can your Age, your Face, your Eyes, and your Spirit bid de­fiance to that sweet Power? No, you know better to what end Heaven made you, know better how to manage Youth and Pleasure, then to let them die and pall upon your Hands.

Take it Ill-natur'd, take it; give it to him who would waste his Fortune for you; give it the Man would fill your Lap with Gold; court you with Offers of vast rich Possessions; give it the Fool that has nothing but his Mony to plead for him; Love will have a much nearer Relation, or none. I ask for glorious Happiness; you bid me Welcome to your Friendship, it is like seating me at your Side-table, when I have the best Pretence to your Right-hand at the Feast. I Love, I Doat, I am Mad, and know no measure; no­thing but Extreams can give me ease; the kindest Love, or most provoking Scorn: Yet even your Scorn would not perform the Cure, it might indeed take off the edge of Hope, but damn'd Despair will gnaw my Heart for ever.

In the late Appendix to the new <span class="hi">Observator,</span> I find the Author reasonably complaining of the corrup­tion of History by the <span class="hi">French,</span> and gi­ving <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4919"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=59">[Page 103]</a></span> a reasonable guess, how false the History of this Age (as far as it is writ by them) is like to come out in the next. And particularly what Monsieur <span class="hi">Pelisson</span>'s History of the present King of <span class="hi">France</span> is like to be, which is now wri­ting by that King's own order. Mon­sieur <span class="hi">Boileau,</span> who writ the enclos'd, has at least as great a share in that History as Monsieur <span class="hi">Pelisson:</span> And therefore you have in the enclos'd, in the which he has very artfully inserted a <span class="hi">Panegyrick</span> of his Prince, a Pattern of what his part of the History will be. For having flatter'd his Master in this small <span class="hi">Panegy­rick,</span> we have all the reason in the World to believe, That he will flatter him too in his History. And that he has flatter'd him here, you will plainly find; not only by Exaggerations, which are in some measure to be allow'd to an Ora­tor; but in affirming things which are directly contrary to the truth. Such are those two remarkable Passages of the <span class="hi">French</span> King's offering Peace to the late Confederacy, for the general good of <span class="hi">Christendom,</span> (which not so much as a <span class="hi">Frenchman,</span> who has common Sense, be­lieves) and of his Bombarding <span class="hi">Genoa,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4964"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=60">[Page 104]</a></span> only to be reveng'd of its Insolency and of its Perfidiousness, which every Man, who has heard the Story of Mr. <span class="hi">Valdryon,</span> must laugh at. Now since it is to be presum'd, that Monsieur <span class="hi">Boileau</span> will flat­ter him in his History, because it is plain that he has <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>latter'd him in his <span class="hi">Panegy­rick</span>; What are we to expect from Mon­sieur <span class="hi">Pelisson,</span> whose sincerity is by no means so much talk'd of as the other's? I thought to have concluded here: But it comes into my mind to make two Refle­ctions upon the Panegyrical part of the enclos'd. The first is this, That since Monsieur <span class="hi">Boileau,</span> who is, in the main, a Man of Sincerity, and a lover of Truth, could not but flatter <span class="hi">Lewis the Fourteenth</span> when he commended him; we may conclude, that it is impossible to give him a general commendation with­out flattery. For, where a Satyrick Poet paints, what other Man must not daub? The second Reflection is this, That since this <span class="hi">Panegyrick</span> is scarce to be supported, notwithstanding the most admirable ge­nius of the Author, which shines through­out it; and an Art to which nothing can be added, (remember that I speak of the Original) and beyond which nothing can <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5007"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=60">[Page 105]</a></span> be desir'd; you may easily conclude how extreamly fulsom the rest of the <span class="hi">Panegy­ricks</span> upon <span class="hi">Lewis the Fourteenth</span> must needs be, whose Authors fall infinitely short of <span class="hi">Boileau</span>'s, either Genius, or Art, or Vertue.</p></div><div class="speech" id="index.xml-body.1_div.8"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5022"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=61">[Page 106]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">8. </span><span class="head">THE SPEECH OF Monsieur <span class="hi">BOILEAV,</span> Upon his Admission into the French Academy.</span></h2><div class="byline">Translated by Mr. <span class="hi">DENNIS.</span></div><p>GENTLEMEN,</p><p>THe Honour this Day confer'd upon me, is something so great, so ex­traordinary, so little expected; and so many several sorts of reasons ought to have for ever excluded me from it, that at this very Moment, in which I return my <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5039"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=61">[Page 107]</a></span> Acknowledgments, I am doubtful if I ought to believe it.

Is it not a Magistrate who fill'd one of the formost Seats in the Council; and who, in so many important Occasions, has been Honoured by his Prince, with his strictest Confi­dence: A Magistrate, no less wise than Experienc'd, watchful, laborious; with whom the more I compare myself, the less Proportion I find.</p><p>I know very well, Gentlemen, (and who can be ignorant of it,) that in the choice which you make of Men who are proper to supply the Vacancies of your learned Assembly, you have no regard either to Place or to Dignity: That Po­liteness, Learning, and an Acquaintance with all the more gentle Arts, have al­ways usher'd in naked Merit to you, and that you do not believe it to be unbecom­ing of you, to substitute in the room of the highest Magistrate, of the most exal­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ed Minister, some famous Poet, or some Writer, whom his Works have rendred Illustrious, and who has very o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ten no other Dignity, than that which his Desert has given him upon <span class="hi">Parnassus.</span> But if you barely consider me as a Man of Learning, what can I offer you that may <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5085"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=62">[Page 109]</a></span> be worthy of the favour, with which you have been pleas'd to honour me? Is it a wretched Collection of Poetry, success­ful rather by a happy temerity and a dex­terous imitation of the Ancients, than by the beauty of its thoughts, or the rich­ness of its expressions? Is it a Translation that falls so far short of the great Master-pieces with which you every day supply us; and in the which you so gloriously revive <span class="hi">Thucydides, Xenophon, Tacitus,</span> and all the rest of the renown'd Heroes of the most learn'd Antiquity? No, Gentlemen, you are too well acquainted with the just value of things, to recompence at a rate so high, such low Productions as mine, and offer me voluntarily upon so slight a foundation, an Honour which the know­ledge of my want of Merit, has discou­rag'd me still from demanding.</p><p>What can be the reason then, which in my behalf has so happily influenc'd you upon this occasion?

for my Ambition to con­verse with you, and advantage in being allow'd it, is too great for me to decline any opportunity which I can improve to obtain so much happiness: But really the Box of Gloves and Ribbons miss'd a conveniency of going, and a Letter that attended them partak'd in the same misfortune; by this time and some days before it I hope they have reach'd you, for they were sent away above a Week ago; and if so, all that I can tell you of my Desires to see your Ladiship will be repetition, for I had with as much earnestness as I was capable of, begg'd it then, and yet have so much of the Beggar in me, that I must redouble that Importunity now, and tell you, That I gasp for you with an Impatience that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6188"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=81">[Page 146]</a></span> is not to be imagin'd by any Soul wound up to a less concern in Friendship than yours is, and therefore I cannot hope to make others sensible of my vast desires to enjoy you, but I can safely appeal to your own illustrious Heart, where I am sure of a Court of Equity to relieve me in all the Complaints and Supplications my Friend­ship can put up: Madam, I am assured you love me, and that being once grant­ed, 'tis out of dispute, that your Love must have nobler circumstances than mine, but because the greatness and reality of it must be always disputed with you, by me there must of necessity remain the obligingness of your Love to weigh down the Ballance, and give you that advan­tage over me in friendship, which you un­questionably have in all things else, and if this reasoning be true, (as sure there are all Sciences in Friendship, and then Logick cannot be excluded) I have ar­gued myself into handsom necessity of being eternally on the receiving hand, but let me qualifie that seeming mean­ness, by assuring you, that even that is the greatest testimony of my esteem for your Ladiship, that ever I can give; for I have a natural pride (that I cannot <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6204"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=81">[Page 147]</a></span> much repent of) which makes me very unwilling to be obliged, and more cu­rious from whom I receive kindnesses than where I confer them;

this, Madam, is but one Action, but, like the Summ of an Account, it contains the Value of all the rest, and will so oblige and refresh me, that I cannot express the satisfaction I shall receive in it; I humbly thank your Ladiship for the assurance you have given me, that you suddenly intend it, and that you were pleased to be account­able to me for your stay till <span class="hi">Christmas,</span> which being now at hand, I hope you will have neither Reason, Importunity, nor Inclinations to retard the Happiness you intend me: Really, Madam, I shall and must expect it in these Holidays, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6223"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=82">[Page 148]</a></span> a disappointment to me is the greatest of Miseries; and then, Madam, I trust you will be convinc'd of this necessity there is of your Life and Health, since Heaven it self appears so much concern'd in it, as to restore it by a Miracle: And, truly, had you been still in danger, I should have look'd upon that as more ominous than the Blazing-star, so much discours'd of;

Some­times I call'd upon you betimes in a Morning, when nothing was to be met in the Streets, but grave Tradesmen, stalking in their Slippers to the next Cof­fee-house; Midnight-drunkards, reeling home from the <span class="hi">Rose</span>; industrious Har­lots, who had been earning a Penny over Night, tripping it on foot to their Lodgings; Ragmen, picking up Mate­rials for <span class="hi">Grubstreet</span>; in short, nothing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6623"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=87">[Page 158]</a></span> but Bailiffs, Chimney-sweepers, Cin­derwomen, and other People of the same early Occupations, and yet, as my ill Stars contriv'd it, you were still gone out before me. At other times I have call'd at Four in Afternoon, the Sober Hour, when other discreet Gentlemen were but newly up, and dressing to go to the Play; but to as little purpose as in the Morning. Then, towards the Evening, I have a hundred times examin'd the Pit and Boxes, the Chocolate-houses, the Taverns, and all places of publick resort, except a Church, (and there, I confess, I cou'd no more expect to meet you, than a right <span class="hi">Beau</span> of the last <span class="hi">Paris</span> Edition in the <span class="hi">Bear-garden</span>) but still I failed of you eve­ry where, tho' sometimes you 'scaped me as narrowly as a Quibble does some mer­ry Statesmen I cou'd name to you. Is it not strange, thought I to my self, that every paltry Astrologer about the Town, by the help of a foolish Telescope, shou'd be able to have the Seven Planets at a Minute's warning, nay, and their very Attendants, their <span class="hi">Satellites</span> too, tho' some of them are so many hundred thousand Miles distant from us, to know precise­ly when they go to Bed, and what Ram­bles <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6649"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=87">[Page 159]</a></span> they take, and yet that I with all my pains and application shou'd never take you in any of your <span class="hi">Orbits,</span> who are so considerably nearer to me? But, for my part, I believe a Man may sooner find out a true Key to the <span class="hi">Revelations,</span> than discover your By-haunts, and solve every Problem in <span class="hi">Euclid</span> much easier than yourself. With all Reverence be it said, Your Ways are as hard to be tra­ced as those of Heaven; and the Dean of <span class="hi">P</span>—, who in his late History of Pro­vidence has explain'd all the several <span class="hi">Phoe­nomena's</span> of it, but his own Conversions, is the fittest Person I know of in the World to account for your Eclipses.

I cou'd almost wish you had been by, to see how heroically he threw off your Chains; with what Alacrity he tore you from his Bosom; and, in fine, with what a Christian Self-denial he renounc'd you; more heartily, I dare swear, than his Godfather abjur'd the Devil for him at his Baptism.</p><p>And now, Madam, tho' I confess you have prevented my Curses, by your choice of such a Coxcomb, and 'tis not good Manners to solicite a Judgment from Heaven on every such Accident at this, (for Providence wou'd have a fine time on't, to be at the expence of a Thunder­bolt, for every Woman that forswears <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6901"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=90">[Page 165]</a></span> herself) yet so much do I resent the ill usage of my Friend, that I cannot for­bear to give you this conviction, how earnestly I can pray, when I set my self to't.

But, with submission, methinks the Language of all three was very sur­prizing: You complain of my absence, and coldness, and the Lord knows what, tho' 'tis but four days ago since I gave you the best convictions of my Love I cou'd, and you flatter'd me strangely, if you were not satisfied with them: May I be as unacceptable to all Womankind as an old Eunuch with <span class="hi">Io.

I have a thousand Obligations to your Ladiship, and till I am in a capacity to repay them, shou'd be as uneasy to see you, as any o­ther Creditor when I have no Money to send him going. I am so very honest in my own nature, that I wou'd not put you off with half Payments, and if I were not, your Ladiship is so discerning, that I might much easier palm clipt Mony upon a Jew, than succeed in such a trick with so nice a Judge. Perhaps, Ma­dam, you are scrupulous in this mat­ter even to a Fault. 'Tis not enough for you, that your Mony is Parlia­mentary, and that other People wou'd be glad on't, for if it is not of the largest size, or wants one grain of its due weight, you reject it with indignation. But, what is the hardest case of all, (and you must pardon me, Madam, if I take this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7280"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=95">[Page 175]</a></span> occasion to reproach you with it) you are for engrossing a Man's whole Cash to your self, and, by your good will, wou'd not leave him one solitary Testar to distribute among the Needy else­where, tho' you don't know what Objects of Charity he may meet abroad. This, in truth, is very severe usage: 'Tis the same as if the Government shou'd only take care to pay off the Soldiers in <span class="hi">Flan­ders,</span> and suffer the poor Seamen to starve. Even the Royal-Oak Lottery, who are fit to be imitated by you in this particular, never strip a Man intirely of all, but let him march off decently with a Crown or two to carry him home. If this Example won't work upon you, pray learn a piece of Tartarian-m<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rcy; they are none of the best bred People in the World, I confess, but are so civil when they come to a place, not to Eat out the Heart of the Soil, but, having serv'd a pre­sent turn, shift their Quarters, and forbear to make a second Visit till the Grass is grown up again. Nay, a Nonconformist Parson, who is a kind of a rambling Church Tartar, but of the worser sort, after he has grazed a beloved Text as bare as the back of one's Hand, is glad <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7296"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=96">[Page 176]</a></span> for his own convenience, to remove to another. Both these Instances, you'll say, look as if I advised you to supply my defect in another place; I leave that to your own discretion, but really your humble Servant's present Exigences are such, that he must be forced to shut up his Exchequer for some time.</p><p>I have a hundred times wished, That those unnatural Rogues, the Writers of Romances, had been all hanged, (<span class="hi">Mon­tague</span> before me did the same for the Sta­tuaries) for giving you, Ladies, such wrong Notions of things.

So now it only remains upon my hands to prove, that you ought not to be concern'd for her Death, if she was an indifferent Wife; and Publick Authority having not thought fit as yet, to oblige us to mourn for Wives of that denomination, it follows, by the Doctrin of the Church of <span class="hi">England,</span> about things indifferent, that you had better let it alone, for fear of giving Scandal to weak Brethren.</p><p>Therefore, Doctor, if you'll take my Advice, in the first place, Pluck up a good Heart; secondly, Smoak your Pipe, as you used to do; thirdly, Read mode­rately; fourthly, Drink plentifully; fifthly and lastly, When you are distri­buting Spoon-meat to the People next Sunday from your Pulpit, cast me a Hawk's Eye round your Congregation, and, if you can, spy out a Farmer's Daugh­ter plump and juicy, one that's likely to be a good Breeder, and whose Father is of some Authority in the Parish, (be­cause that may be necessary for the Sup­port of Holy Church) say no more, but pelt her with Letters, Hymns and Spiri­tual Sonnets, till you have gain'd your <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7486"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=99">[Page 182]</a></span> Carnal Poi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t of her.

To make my Vi­sits more acceptable, I us'd to compliment her upon her Charms and all that<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> where by the by, my dear Friend, you may take it for a general Rule, that the Uglier your Women are, and the Duller your Men, they are the easier to be flat­ter'd into a belief of their Beauty and Wit. I told her, she was resolv'd to act <span class="hi">Sampson's</span> part, and Kill more People in the last Scene of her Life, than other La­dies cou'd pretend to do in the whole five Acts of theirs. By a certain awkard Joy, that display'd itself all over her Counte­nance, and glowed even through her Cheeks of Buff, I cou'd perceive this nau­seous Incense was not unwelcome to her. 'Tis true, she had the Grace to deny all this; and told me, I rallied her, but de­dy'd it so, as intriguing Sparks deny they have lain with fine Women, and some <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7781"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=103">[Page 191]</a></span> Wou'd-be Poets deny their writing of Fa­therless Lampoons, when they have a mind at the same time to be thought they did what they coldly disown. I cou'd not but observe upon this, and several o­ther occasions, how merciful Heaven has been to us, in weaving Self-love so closely into our Natures, in order to make Life palatable. 'The Divines indeed arraign it as a Sin; that is, they wou'd make us more miserable than Providence ever de­sign'd us, though were it not for this very Sin, not one of them in a hundred wou'd have Courage enough to talk in publick. For my part, I always consider'd it as the best Friend, and greatest blessing we have, without which, all those merry Farces that now serve to entertain us wou'd be lost, and the World itself be as silent and melancholy as a Spanish Court. 'Tis this blessed Vanity that makes all Mankind easie and chearful at home, (for no Body's a Fool, or a Rascal, or Ugly, or Imper­tinent in his own Eyes) that makes a Miser think himself Wise, an affected Coxcomb think himself a Wit, a thriving gay Villain think himself a Politician, and, in short, that makes my Lady <span class="hi">Court-all</span> believe herself agreeable. But to quit <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7795"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=104">[Page 192]</a></span> this Digression and pursue my Story.</p><p>On the Day abovemention'd, this dry Puss of Quality, that had such a furious longing to be Matrimonially larded, stole out of her House with two of her Grave Companions, and never did a Country Justice's Oatmeal-eating Daughter of Fifteen use more discretion to be undone with her Father's Clark, or Chaplain. <span class="hi">Gray</span>'s <span class="hi">Inn</span> Walks was the place of Ren­dezvous, where, after they had taken a few Turns, <span class="hi">Lisanio</span> and she walked sepa­rately to the Chappel, and the Holy Ma­gician Conjur'd them into the Circle. From thence they drove home in several Coaches, Din'd together, but not a Syl­lable of the Wickedness they had com­mitted, till towards Night, because then I suppose their Blushes were best conceal­ed, they thought fit to own all. Upon this some few Friends were invited, and the Fiddles struck up, and my old Lady frisk'd about most notably, but was as much overtopp'd, and put out of Counte­nance, by the Young Women, as <span class="hi">Somer­set-house</span> with the New Buildings. Not to enter into a Detail of all that happen'd, this rusty Gammon of Bacon at last was <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7829"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=104">[Page 193]</a></span> dished up between a pair of clean Sheets, soon after the Bridegroom follow'd, go­ing to act <span class="hi">Curtius</span>'s Story, and leap alive into a Gulf. Let others envy his fine E­quipage, and brace of Footmen, that think it worth the while; as for me, I shall always pity the Wretch, who, to fill his Guts at Noon, obliges himself to work in a Mine all Night. A poor Knight of <span class="hi">Alsatia,</span> that Dines upon good whol­some Air in the Temple-Walks, is a Prince to him.</p><p>I met <span class="hi">Lisanio</span> this Morning at the <span class="hi">Rain-bow,</span> and whether 'twas his Pride, or ill Humour, since Marriage, I can't tell; but he looked as grum as a Fanatick that fancies himself to be in the State of Grace. I have read somewhere, that the Great Mogul weighs himself once a Year, and that the Courtiers rejoyce or grieve, ac­cording as the Royal Body increases or di­minishes. I wonder why some of our Nice Beaux that are Married, don't do the like, to know exactly what Depreda­tions a Spouse makes upon the Body Na­tural. As for <span class="hi">Lisanio,</span> I wou'd advise him never to do it, because if he wastes proportionably to what he has done this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7863"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=105">[Page 194]</a></span> Week, a Skeleton will out-weigh him by the Year's End. But this is not half the Mortification that a Man must expect, who, to shew his Courage, ventures up­on a Widow. Though he mounts the Guard every Night, and wears out his Carcase in her Service, till at last, like <span class="hi">Wi­therington,</span> in the Ballad, he fight's upon his Stumps, yet he's never thanked for his pains; But labours under the same ill Cir­cumstances with a King that comes after one that is deposed, for he's sure to be told of his Predecessor upon all occasions. The second Temple at <span class="hi">Ierusalem,</span> was, with­out question, a Noble Structure, and yet we find the old Fellows wept, and shook their Heads at it: Every Widow is so far a Jew in her Heart, that as long as the World lasts, the second House will fall short of the Glory of the first. And in­deed I am apt to imagine the Complaints is just, for a Maid and Widow are two different things; and how can it be ex­pected that a Man shou'd come with the same Appetite to a Second-hand Dish, as he brought with him when it was first serv'd upon the Table?</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7886"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=105">[Page 195]</a></span>And now Mr. <span class="hi">Knight,</span> I am upon the Chapter of Widows, give me leave to add a word or two more. A true Widow is as seldom unfurnish'd of an Excuse to Marry again, as a true Toper is without an Argument for Drinking. Let it rain or shine, be hot or cold, 'tis all one, a true Son of <span class="hi">Bacchus</span> never wants a good Reason to push about the Glass. And so a Widow, if she had a good Husband, thinks herself obliged, in meer Gratitude to Providence, to venture again; and if he was a bad one, she only tries to mend her hand in a second Choice. It was not so with the People of <span class="hi">Athens</span> and <span class="hi">Rome.</span> The former had a King that lost his Life in their Quarrel, and they wou'd have no more, because he was too good for them<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> as the latter, because theirs was an ill one. But Common-wealths, you know, are Whymsical things. I have on­ly one thing more to say before I have done, which though it looks like a Para­dox at first sight, yet after you have con­sider'd a while upon it, I fancy you'll grant to be true: 'Tis in short this, That a Man is the decay of his Vigour, when he begins to mistrust his Abilities, had <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7911"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=106">[Page 196]</a></span> much better Marty a Widow than a Maid, For, as Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Suckling</span> has long ago observed, a Widow is a sort of Quag­mire, and you know the finest Racer may be as soon founder'd there, as the heavi­est Dray-horse.

I was told a melancholy Story t'other Day of two hopeful young Attorneys, who, up­on the general Decay of their Profession, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8467"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=110">[Page 204]</a></span> were glad to turn Presbyterian Divines; and that you'll say is a damn'd Time in­deed, when Lawyers are forced to turn Peace-makers. But as the World grows richer, People will recover by degrees out of this State of Laziness; Law Suits will multiply, and Discord make as splendid a Figure in the Hall as ever. Head­strong Squires will Rebel against their Lady Mothers, and the Church no long­er connive at the abominable Sacrilege of Tythe-Pigs and Eggs converted to Lay Uses.</p><p>And then, as for the honest Good-fel­lows of the Town, whose Souls have mourn'd in Secret, ever since the un­righteous Abdication of Claret; how will they rejoyce to see their old Friend sold at Twelve-pence a Quart again? What Matter of Joy will it be to his Ma­jesty's Liege-people, that they can get Drunk with half the Cost, and conse­quently with half the Repentance next Morning? This will in a particular man­ner, revive the drooping Spirits of the City Sots; for nothing goes so much a­gainst a true <span class="hi">Cheapside</span> Conscience, as an expensive Sin. As times go now, a young­er Brother can hardly peep into a Tavern <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8495"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=110">[Page 205]</a></span> without entailing a Week's Sobriety up­on himself; which, considering what Oc­casions there may be to drink away the Publick and Private Calamities, is a sad Mortification. Wine indeed is grown a sullen Mistress, that will only be enjoy'd by Men of some Fortune, and not by them neither, but upon solemn Days; so that if these wicked Taxes continue, <span class="hi">Canary</span> it self, tho' a Confederate of ours, is like to meet the Fate of condemn'd Criminals, to return to the dismal Place from whence it came, an Apothecary's Shop; and to be distributed about by discreet Nurses in the Primitive sneaking Gill. 'Tis true, the Parliament, as it became those to whom the People had delegated their Power, thought to obvi­ate these Grievances, by the Six-penny Act, and laying a Five hundred Pound Fine upon Cellar-Adultery; but the Vint­ners, an impudent Generation, broke through these Laws as easily as if they had been Senators themselves; nay, had the Boldness to raise new Exactions up­on the Subject: This obliged one half of the Town, at least, to come down a Story lower, and take up with dull <span class="hi">Eng­lish</span> Manufacture, so that half our Wit <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8516"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=111">[Page 206]</a></span> lies buried in execrable Flip, or fulsome <span class="hi">Nottingham.</span> To this may be ascribed all those phlegmatick, sickly Compositi­ons, that have loaded of late both the Theatres, most of which puny Butter-prints, like Children begot by Pockey Parents, were scarce able to endure the Christening; and others, with mighty pains and difficulty, lived just long e­nough (a <span class="hi">Methuselah</span>'s Age!) to be Crown'd with Damnation on the third Day. But when Money circulates mer­rily, and Claret is to be had at the old Price, a new Spirit will appear abroad, Wit and Mirth will shake off their Fet­ters; and <span class="hi">Parnassus,</span> that has made such heavy returns of late Years, will trade considerably. It would be too tedious to reckon up all the other Advantages that the Kingdom will receive by this joyful turn of the Scene; but there are some behind, which I must not omit, because the Publick is so nearly concern'd in them. We have a World of Married Men now, that, to save Charges, take St. <span class="hi">Paul</span>'s Advice in the Literal Sence, and, having Wives, live as if they had none at all, and so defraud both them and the Government; but upon the hap­py <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8542"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=111">[Page 207]</a></span> Arrival of Peace, they'll vigorously set their Hands to the Plough again, and the Stale Batchelors too will find Encou­ragement to Marry, and leave behind them a pious Race of Fools, that, within these Twenty Years, will be ripe to be knock'd in the Head, in defence of the Liberty of the Subject, and the Prote­stant Religion.</p><p>We hear there's such a thing as New Money in the City, but it only visits the Elect, for the Generality of People are such Reprobates to the Government, that they may sooner get God's Grace, than a Mill'd Crown-piece. To inflame our Reckoning, tho' there's so little Sil­ver stirring in the Nation, that Dr. <span class="hi">Cham­berlain</span> is in greater hopes than ever of making his Paper-project take, yet the World was never so unseasonably scru­pulous. What an Usurer wou'd have leap'd at in King <span class="hi">Charles</span>'s Time, our ve­ry Porters now reject; which is full as ridiculous, as if in the present Difficulty of raising Recruits, a Captain shou'd resolve to take no Men but such as were eight Foot high, or a Gentleman in the last Ebb of his Fortune, when he can scarcely pay for Small-beer, shou'd then, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8565"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=112">[Page 208]</a></span> and never before, fall in Love with <span class="hi">Champagen.</span> The last Year we had Mo­ney enough, such as it was, merrily Cir­cumcised, the Lord knows, however it made a shift to find us Wine and Harlots: Now 'tis all silenc'd, and in the room of it, (but that too, will soon suffer Cir­cumcision) Faith passes for current, and never was there a Time of more Uni­versal Chalk, since the Apostolical Ages. This, among other Evils, cannot but have an ill Effect, <span class="hi">My dear Doctor,</span> upon the Gentlemen of your Profession; for People at present, are so taken up with the Publick Transactions, or their own Losses, that they have no leisure, or are so poor, that they have no fancy to be Sick. The Generality of those that are, Christen a Distemper as they do Ship­wracks in <span class="hi">Cornwall,</span> by the Name of God's Blessing, and tho' a Legion of Di­seases invest them, don't think it worth the while to send for a Physician to raise the Siege: If they do, 'tis for none of the College, 'tis for some Half-Crown Chirurgeon, who has cheated the World into an Opinion of his Skill, by putting Greek into his Sign, or for a Twelve-penny Seventh Son, that preaches on <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8589"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=112">[Page 209]</a></span> Horseback in the Streets; but in the Case of Chronical Diseases, <span class="hi">let the World rub,</span> is the general Language. Men put off the mending of their Bodies, as they do of ill-tenanted Cottages, till they have Money to spare. There's a venerable Bawd in <span class="hi">Covent-garden,</span> that had her Windows demolished last <span class="hi">Shrove-Tuesday,</span> and she won't repair them nei­ther, till there's a General Peace.</p><p>I believe no Body in the Nation will be averse to it, but only our Friends in Red, and these find their Account so vi­sibly in the continuance of the War, that if they ever pray, which, I believe, is but seldom, we must excuse 'em if 'tis against that Petition, <span class="hi">Da pacem Domine in Diebus nostris.</span> Some of 'em quitted <span class="hi">Cook</span> upon <span class="hi">Littleton,</span> and some aban­don'd other Stations to go into the Ser­vice; and these upon a Change of Af­fairs, must either turn Padders upon <span class="hi">A­pollo</span>'s, or the King's high Road, and ei­ther turn Authors, or <span class="hi">Grands Voleurs,</span> in their own defence. But <span class="hi">Paul</span>'s will be built in a short time, and then a <span class="hi">Low-Country</span> Captain will make as busie a Figure in the Middle Isle, as ever his Predecessors did in the Days of <span class="hi">Ben. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8642"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=113">[Page 210]</a></span> Iohnson.</span> Some of them may fight o­ver the Battels of <span class="hi">Steenkirk</span> and <span class="hi">Landen</span> in Ordinaries, or demonstrate how <span class="hi">Na­mur</span> was taken, by scaling the Walls of a <span class="hi">Christmas</span> Pye; and others set up Fen­cing Schools, to instruct the City Youth. The latter, indeed, will act most natu­rally; for I observe, that when People are forc'd to change their Professions, they keep to 'em as nigh as they can, tho' they act in a lower Sphere: So for instance, a batter'd Harlot makes a dis­creet Bawd, and a broken Cutler an ex­cellent Grinder of Knives. As for the Poets, I believe they are the most indif­ferent Men in the Kingdom as to what happens: They have lost nothing by the <span class="hi">French</span> Privateers since the Revoluti­on; nor are like to do, if the War lasts Seven Years longer, so it may be suppo­sed they will not be angry to see the on­ly Calumny of their Profession, I mean their Poverty made universal; and in­deed, if to pay People with fair Words, and no Performance, be Poetical, there's more Poetry in <span class="hi">Grocers-hall,</span> than in <span class="hi">Par­nassus</span> it self.</p><p>But, <span class="hi">My dear Doctor,</span> after all this mighty Discourse of a Peace, for my <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8698"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=113">[Page 211]</a></span> part, I shou'd believe as little of it, as I do of most of Mr. <span class="hi">Aubrey</span>'s Apparition Stories, but that we have not Money e­nough to carry on this great Law Suit, much longer, (for in effect, War is no other, only you must Fee more Coun­cil, and give greater Bribes) and the Lord have Mercy, say I, on a Man that Sues, or a Prince that fights for his Right in <span class="hi">Forma Pauperis.</span> This, and nothing but this, makes me imagine we shall have a Peace, and not the Christian Piety of one or t'other side. And to say the truth, half the Vertue in the World, if traced to the Cradle, will be found to be the lawful Issue of meer Necessity.

One reason I believe is, that we hate to be long confin'd, and their Conversation soon palls; tho' what may be assigned, with greater plausibleness, I think is, that those very Favours a Woman grants to her Lover, increase and continue her Affection, but withal lessen his. Mens <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9016"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=118">[Page 219]</a></span> Passion almost always extinguish with possession; and what is the Parent of a Woman's Tenderness is the Paricide of ours: We seldom adore longer than we desire, and what we aim at most can be conferr'd but once. In our Sex there is not that fatal distinction: but as a Vir­gin, after yielding, has dispossess'd her­self of that Jewel which every one was willing to have purchas'd, and only courted her for. I believe the Demon­strations of Love from Women, are more real than ours; there being too frequently more of Vanity than Verity, more of Study than Affection in our Pre­tences: But it's no small Wound in a Woman's Heart, that constrains her to speak, and I really am of opinion, that she can hardly love more violently, who confesses she loves at all. A Word some­times drops from their Mouths, which, as it was undesign'd, gives a clearer evi­dence of a growing Inclination, than all the elaborate Actions and affected Lan­guishings, the greatest part of Gallants put in practice. A lovely Face is cer­tainly the most agreeable Object our Eyes can behold, and the very Sound of the Voice of one we dearly love, is be­yond <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9038"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=119">[Page 220]</a></span> the softest Harmony: Yet, by I know not what Fate, I have seen the Juncture when both were without any effect, and this more than once. The Latitude (I fancy) which we take in our Addresses, makes the Impression but feeble: Variety of Objects distracts the choice, and we conserve our Liberty while we are pitching upon a Tyrant. The indulgence of one Woman, who is not extreamly charming, makes some sort of reparation for the slighted Vows we vainly offer'd to a cruel Beauty. Few Men are so much in love, as to be Proof against the continued Scorn of the most agreeable <span class="hi">Phillis:</span> We ask to obtain, not to be deny'd; and he that can find the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ame satisfaction in every place, will hardly <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e long confin'd to any one. Not but that Women, speaking generally, are not so perfidious as Men; and it is Iniustice, as well as Malice, in us to treat 'em as we do. They deserve really more than Policy will permit us to shew 'em they do.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your Lordship's Humble Servant, <span class="hi">AYLOFFE.</span></div></div></div><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.14_div.2"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9060"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=119">[Page 221]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">14.2. </span><span class="head">To a Friend in the Country.</span></h3><p>YOu have now, at length, left scour­ing the Watch, and teizing the Exchange-women, bid adieu to <span class="hi">Bour­deaux,</span> and taken up with Barrel-ale. You are all the Morning galloping after a Fox; all the Evening in a smoaky Chim­ny-corner, recounting whose Horse leap'd best, was oftenest in with the Dogs, and how readily Lightfoot hit the cooling Scent, and reviv'd your drooping Spi­rits with a prospect of more diversion; which some Men, who think themselves as wise in the enjoyment of this World, as all the Men in <span class="hi">Oxford-shire,</span> are pleas'd to term meer fatigue. And I believe your own Footman would not ride so far and so hard to fetch a good Dinner, as both of you do to see the Death of a stinking Beast. Has not the <span class="hi">Rose</span> as good Accommodation as your <span class="hi">Catherine-wheel</span> Inn? And does not a Masque give a more Christian-like chase, and conclude in more satisfaction than the Animal you <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9086"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=120">[Page 222]</a></span> wot of? I saw your Letters to some of our Club, and laugh'd not a little at the strangeness of your Style; it smelt of fil­thy Tobacco, and was stain'd with your dropping Tankard. You acquainted 'em at large with the Scituation of your Man­sion-house; how a knot of branching Elms defended it from the North-wind; that the South-sun gave you good Grapes, and most sort of Wall-fruits; your Me­lons came on apace, and you had hopes of much good Fruit this Summer. After all, in <span class="hi">Covent-gard<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n</span> Market, we can buy, in one quarter of an Hour, better Plants than your's, and richer Melons, for Groats a piece, than you have been poring over this three Months. You thank'd 'em for some News, that was so old we hardly could imagin what you meant, till <span class="hi">Tom,</span> who has all the Gazetts and Pamphlets lock'd up in his Heart, as <span class="hi">David</span> did the Commandments, disclos'd the Mystery to us. I pity your new State indeed: Your Gazetts are as stale as your Drink; which, tho' brew'd in <span class="hi">March,</span> is not broach'd till <span class="hi">December.</span> The chief Topicks of Discourse, (for Conver­sation you have none) are Hawks, Hor­ses, and Hounds; every one of 'em as <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9119"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=120">[Page 223]</a></span> much God's Image as he that keeps 'em, and glorifies the Creator in a greater de­gree, and to more purpose. This you call a seasonable retreat from the Lewd­ness of <span class="hi">London,</span> to enjoy a calm and quiet Life: Heaven knows you drink more there, and more ignoble and ungenerous Liquors than we in Town; for yours is down-right Drinking: Your Whoring I will allow safer, but it is meer Brutali­ty too; there is no such thing as Intrigue in all your County, which is like an ex­quisite Sawce to good Meat, qualifying the Palate more voluptuously. Well, 'tis Six, and I must to the Club, whereas we will Pity your Solitude, and Drink your Prosperity, in a Cup that is worth a Stable of Horses and a Kennel of Hounds So adieu.</p></div><div class="trailer">The End of the First Volume.</div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="advertisement" id="index.xml-back.1_div.1"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9137"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=37805&amp;page=121">[Page]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">Appendix A </span><span class="head">BOOKS newly Printed for and Sold by <span class="hi">Sa­muel Briscoe,</span> in <span class="hi">Russel-street,</span> the Corner of Charles-street, Covent-garden, 1697.</span></h2><ul><li class="item"><span class="hi">POlybius</span>'s Roman History, translated by Sir <span class="hi">H.
