And the ſtones of the Temple (they ſay) were ſo cloſe, ſo ſi­mented together, as if there were but one ſtone, there was no pieecing appear'd or was ſeene by any, though they looked narrowly. The ſtones of the Temple, they that would helpe to build up Gods Temple, ſhould ſtand cloſe together, and remove bones of conten­tions, and difference, and rivality, and emu­lation.

If they be bold to claime kinne of us, and to beare the world in hand, that our owne Ar­ticles maintaine a ſecret correſpondence with Popery, it is time for our zeale to breake out to quit the Church, this Noble and honourable Church, from ſuch a diſho­nourable imputation: The Act it ſelfe of zeale is very opportune and ſeaſonable: <span class="hi">Nunc ſi unquam,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note90">2.

A cold modeſty betrayes a woman invites, and provokes an impudent ſoliciter, a coy magnanimous countenance muſt vindi­cate her aſſaulted Chaſtity.

The leaſt beame of light is able to breake through the thickeſt darkeneſſe, to ſhine in the darkeſt place. The leaſt ſparke of fire is enough (if well husbanded and impro­ved) to kindle the whole world. And as at the day of Conflagration, that purgatory fire that ſhall purge and refine all the ele­ments, is conceived it ſhall be out of a contri­bution and commixion of ſtarres. That of all the burning and ſhining lights, there ſhall be made that great heate that ſhall conſume all the burning and ſhining lights of Sathans Kingdome, if they would contribute and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1688"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1967&amp;page=17">[Page 30]</a></span> make a ſhot together of their zeale, to make an oppoſition of ſinne and ſuperſtition.</p><p>And in the laſt place,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note92">3.

We have received the Lampe of Gods Word and truth from our Predeceſſors, who have de­livered it us: let us runne on cheerefully and couragiouſly, to deliver it to our ſucceſſors, and ſo to all poſterity. Though fire in the houſe may be dangerous, there's no man but deſires to have fire on the hearth that's uſeful: though among inferiour and ignorant peo­ple, heate with light may be dangerous, yet among the Clergie, among the Judicious and able Clergie, if their light were quickned to heate, there would be no danger but excel­lent uſe of it.</p><p>And the world expects ſo much of us,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note95">2.
