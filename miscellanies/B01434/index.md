## 1\. ARSY VERSY: OR, The Second Martyrdom of the RUMP.

To the Tune of, The Blind Beggar of Bednall-green.

1.

MY Muſe, to prevent leſt an after-clap come,

If the wind ſhould once more turn about for the Bum,

As a preface of honour, and not as a frump

Firſt with a Sirreverence uſhers the Rump.

2.

I ſhall-not diſpute whether Long-tailes of Kent,

Or Papiſts this name of diſgrace did invent;

Whoſe Legend of lies, to defame us the more,

Hath entail'd on us Rumps ne're heard on before.

3.

But not on its Pedigree longer to think,

(For the more it is ſtirr'd the more it will ſtink)

'Tis agreed the Rump's firſt report in the Town

Did ariſe from the wooden invention of Brown.

4.

Old Oliver's noſe had taken in ſnuffe,

When it ſate long ago, ſome unſavoury pu [...]

Then up went the Rump, and was ferkt to the qu [...]ck,

But it ſetled in ſpight of the teeth of poor Dick.

5.

Then the Knight of the Peſtle, King Lambert, and Vane

With a Scepter of Iron did over it reign:

But the Rump ſoon re-ſetled, and to their diſgrace

Like Excrements voided them out of the place.

6.

It did now, like a Truant's well-diſciplin'd Bum,

With the Rod of affliction harder become;

Or elſe like the Image in Daniel it was,

Whoſe head was of Gold, but whoſe tail was of Braſſe.

7.

It endur'd the firſt heat, and prov'd no ſtarter,

But ſung in the midſt of the flames like a Martyr

And whisk'd the tail like a terrible Farter,

And ſounded moſt cheerfully, Vive Sir Arthur.

8.

But the next fire Ordeall put into a dump,

Sir Orlando the furious chief joynt of the Rump,

That he look'd like the picture of Richard the Third,

Or like an ejected and froſt-bitten t—

9.

'Tis ſaid that his Durindana he drew,

And a Wight on the Road moſt manfully ſlew;

But, pardon'd by Charls, made good what they tell us

How ill'tis to ſave a thief from the Gallows.

10.

Being now to be burn'd, he ſoon did expire,

For he was but a flaſh, and would quickly take fire,

So that their fewell upon him to ſpend,

What was it but Coals to Newcaſtle to ſend?

11.

To bring 'em to th' ſtake as in order they lye,

Harry Martin the next place muſt occupy;

'Twas expected in vain he ſhould blaze, for he ſwore,

That he had been burnt to the ſtumps before.

12.

Tom Scot for the Bum moſt ſtifly did ſtand,

Though once by a Bum he was fouly trapand;

But Time and his Office of Secretary

Had learnt him his buſineſſe more private to carry.

13.

Some thought he arriv'd at his dignity firſt,

By being ſo well in iniquity verſt,

The myſtery of which he hath practis'd of late

In his function, which was, to be Baud to the S [...]

14.

Hob Morley in ſilence did ſuffer the loſſe

Of his Rump, and with patience took up the C [...]

That to ſee him ſo findg'd and ſo ſcorcht you w [...]ear

No Camell more meekly his burden could bear.

15.

The Speaker was thought to the Rump to be true

Becauſe like a Part at the firſt he burnt blew,

But ſtreight he was cunningly ſeen to retire,

For fear to endanger the Rolls in the fire.

16.

St. John a mortall of fleſh and of blood,

Swore by St.

He hath a great kindneſs for that Saint, not becauſe of his Keys, (which he
knows he ſhall never make uſe of) but in reference to Peterborough Min­ſter,
the ſtones of which built his new Houſe.

Peter the example was good:

So facing about and ſhifting his ſtation,

He turn'd o're a new leaf in St. John's Revelation.

17.

Harry Nevill that look's lik a Mahomet's Pidgeon,

Accuſed to be of a State-man's Religion,

Is left to his choice what Proceſſe he'l have,

To be burnt for an Atheiſt, or hang'd for a Knave.

18.

Now ſtop thy noſe, Reader, for Atkins does come,

That ſhame to the Breeches as well as the Bum:

To wiſh he were burnt were an idle deſire,

For he comes provided to ſhite out the fire.

19.

But leaſt he without a Companion ſhould be,

Here's Liſle that comes next ſtinks worſer than he;

So fouly corrupt, you may plac't in your Creed,

Such a Rump [...] alone ſuch a Fiſtula breed.

20.

Poor Ludlow was bogg'd in Ireland of late,

And to purg-him ſelf came to the Rump of the State;

But gravely they told him he had acted amiſſe,

When he ſought to betray the Rump with a kiſſe.

21.

Ned Harby was ſive an herb John in the pot,

Yet could he not ſcape the dyſaſterous lot:

Scarce Church'd of the Gout was the truſty old Squire,

But he hopt from the frying-pan into the fire.

22.

Robin Andrews was laid on laſt as they tell us

For a Log to keep down the reſt of his fellows;

Though he ſpent on the City like one of the Royſters

Each morning his

Some Authors hold it was but three half-pence, but Poetry will not admit of
broken numbers.

two-pence in Sack and in Oyſters.

23.

Next Praiſe-God, although of the Rump he was none,

Was for his Petition burnt to the Bare-bone:

So Praiſe-God and Rump, like true Joſephs together,

Did ſuffer; but Praiſe-God loſt the more

Courteous Reader, he is a Leather-ſeller

Leather.

24.

There's Lawſon another dag-lock of the tail,

That the fire to avoid to the water did ſail;

And in godly ſimplicity means (as they ſay)

To manage the Stern, though the Rump's out of play.

25.

But Overton moſt with wonder doth ſeize us,

By ſecuring of Hull for no leſs than Chriſt Jeſus,

Hoping (as it by the ſtory appears)

To be  [...]ere his Lieutenant for one thouſand years.

26.

Lord Monſon? Oh Venus! what do you hear?

I little thought you were a Rumper I ſwear:

But an [...] Lord will thus far avail,

He w [...] cloak to cover the tail.

27.

To  [...] Mr. Salsbury's come,

With  [...] Gold that fall from the Bum;

[...]ure 'twas  [...]eccor, for I muſt tell yee,

It ſmell as were turning to th' Alderman's jelly.

28.

Brother Pembrock comes laſt, and does not diſdain,

Though de [...]pis'd by the world, to bear up the train;

But after new lights ſo long he did run,

That they brought him to Bethlehem before they had done.

Not Bethlehem in Judea, (for he is none of the Magi.)

29.

Thus the Foxes of Sampſon that carried a Brand

[...] their  [...] to deſtroy and to burn up the Land;

[...] the flam [...]ey had kindred themſelves do expire,

[...] the D [...]ive them brimſtone unto their fire.
