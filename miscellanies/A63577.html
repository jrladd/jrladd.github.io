How it was managed you beſt know, and therefore are proper Judges of the matters of fact related in this <span class="hi">Narrative.</span> For my own part, I have took much Pains, and uſed great Care and Conſideration in the Review of thoſe Papers you ſent me from thoſe that wrote down the Diſpute, that I might do no Wrong to either Party.</p><p>And herein I have had all the Helps I could obtain both from our Brother <span class="hi">Williams,</span> who was engaged with me in the Diſpu­tation; from whom I received (by the hands of Mr. <span class="hi">Sharp,</span> our <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e427"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">Moderator)</span> an Account of thoſe Arguments he offered, and what elſe he could remember, taken from his own mouth: beſides the account I have had by Letters from divers other Perſons that were preſent. All which I have diligently compared, and have alſo endeavoured (ſo far as thoſe Accounts and my own Memory would furniſh me therewith) not only to give a true Narrative of what was ſpoken, but alſo to give our <span class="hi">Antagoniſts</span> Words their due weight as well as our own.</p><p>And if there be any thing omitted therein, they muſt blame themſelves, or their own Scribe, and not us. For Mr. <span class="hi">William Leddell</span> went to Mr. <span class="hi">Smith</span> their Writer, and carried our Copy with him, and deſired him to compare it with his: He anſwer­ed, that his was very imperfect, it being the firſt time he was in a <span class="hi">Diſpute,</span> and he could not take it, but ſome things were left out; and ſaid, that it was not as yet wholly written over. Mr. <span class="hi">Leddell</span> waited upon him a ſecond time, but could not obtain a ſight of it to compare them together, although he was ſatisfied it was then finiſhed. Now whether he did this of himſelf, or by Advice from them, is beſt known to himſelf. However, it leaves us without blame.</p><p>I know it is not proper for me (who was principally concerned in it) to ſay much concerning the <span class="hi">Diſpute</span> it ſelf: for being made Publick, it's left to every one that reads it to judge for himſelf. Nevertheleſs, it may not be amiſs to make ſome few Remarks upon it; becauſe it may fall into ſome hands who may not well underſtand the Grounds of the Controverſie.</p><p>1. It is agreed on both ſides, That Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span>'s Sermons were the occaſion of that Offence taken by you, and of the <span class="hi">Diſ­pute</span> it ſelf; as appears by the <span class="hi">Preliminaries</span> ſigned by Mr. <span class="hi">Tho­mas Bowes</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">William Leddell</span> on our part, and alſo by Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> on the part of the <span class="hi">Presby­terians:</span> as you may ſee in <span class="hi">p. 3, 4.</span></p><p>2. The Objections being made againſt what Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> preach'd, it had been his proper Work to have vindicated the Truth of his Doctrine againſt thoſe Objections, by the Authority of Holy Scripture. But inſtead thereof, he puts us upon it to prove the contrary. But as the learned Dr. <span class="hi">Smith</span> did well ob­ſerve, <span class="hi">He that aſſerts muſt prove.</span> And their own <span class="hi">Modera­tor</span> did declare, that Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> had in his Preaching aſſert­ed, that Infants are the Subjects of Baptiſm, but told us we were not to call on him for that <span class="hi">then.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e522"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> 3. I would make this farther Remark upon it, That the Rea­ſon why he took this method was, becauſe he was unable to prove what he had aſſerted: for in one of his Sermons he thus ſpeaks; <span class="hi">But that I may proceed with the greater clearneſs, I ſhall do theſe things; firſt, prove from Scripture the Warrantableneſs of Infant-Baptiſm,</span> &amp;c. And to make his Aſſertion good, he cites the Commiſſion, <span class="hi">Matth. 28. 19.</span> for the Baptizing the In­fants of believing Parents. And argues upon it, that Diſciples were to be Baptized; and (ſaith he) <span class="hi">we have a plain Text that ſuch Infants are Diſciples,</span> ſee <span class="hi">Acts 15. 10.</span> And when our Saviour ſaith, <span class="hi">Go make Diſciples, baptizing them,</span> it muſt be underſtood of ſuch Infants. Now as to his Pretence from <span class="hi">Acts 15. 10.</span> we did ſufficiently enervate that. And as for the Commiſſion, Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> doth confeſs (as well as Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler)</span> that it is a Command, and that the Command is expreſs'd, <span class="hi">pag. 27.</span> And farther ſaith, in <span class="hi">pag. 28. We muſt all confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt gave Commiſſion to Baptize Belie­vers when at the Age of maturity; but afterwards the Chil­dren of thoſe Believers.</span> Yet when Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> begins to anſwer my first Argument, he affirms, <span class="hi">That Chriſt hath no where expreſly commanded Infants to be Baptized.</span> See <span class="hi">p. 6.</span> And if ſo, then Infants cannot be intended, either in that Com­miſſion, or any other place where there is a Command in Holy Scripture for Baptiſm. So that he needs no other Confutation than his own Confeſſion, in the preſence, as is ſuppoſed, of about 2000 Witneſſes.</p><p>4. As for their Conſequences which they were ſo deſirous to have a Grant from me that I would allow them to make uſe of; it's very obſervable, that if they can do any thing that way, it's yet to be done; for they did not offer them to us in the Diſputa­tion, but have reſerved them in their own Breaſts, as the <span class="hi">Pope</span> doth his unwritten Traditions. And how they ſhould think the People ſhould be convinced of the truth of their Practice, when they tell them there is no expreſs Command in Scripture for it, and pretend only they have ſome Conſequences to prove it by, and yet refuſe to tell what theſe Conſequences are, it is beyond my Imagination. I can aſſure them, thoſe that can take up a Sa­tisfaction in ſuch empty Pretences, are ſufficiently prepared to be Prieſt-ridden, with a witneſs.</p><p>5. When they ſhould have proved (if they had known how) that Infants are capable to be made Diſciples by the Miniſtry of Men, according to Chriſt's Commiſſion; they tell us (inſtead <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e587"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> thereof) That Children are accounted ſo when they firſt enter the School, and call a School-maſter for their Voucher. When the very naming of it confutes themſelves, becauſe they are ſo far from being made Scholars by Teaching, that they know not one Letter of the Book, by their own Confeſſion.</p><p>6. I cannot but obſerve how ſtrenuouſly they oppoſed them­ſelves againſt our way of Baptizing by Dipping; and rejected the Authority of their own Authors, and divers of the greateſt Pro­teſtant Writers ſince the <span class="hi">Reformation,</span> who have aſſerted our Practice therein to be agreeable to the Etymology of the Word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, and the Practice of <span class="hi">John the Baptiſt,</span> Christ and his Apoſtles; and yet themſelves can (when it is to ſerve a Turn) practiſe it the ſame way, by plunging the Perſon over Head and Ears in Water. An Inſtance whereof, as I received it (well atteſted) from ſeveral hands (and the Perſons own Confeſſion) take as followeth.</p><p>To back that Inſtance of Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span>'s about the Virgin <span class="hi">Mary</span> and our Saviour in anſwer to Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span>'s Demand, namely, to give him an Inſtance of one Perſon that was born of a Believer, and was Baptized when he came to grown years, ſee <span class="hi">pag. 34, 35.</span> We can give you an Account of one whoſe Pa­rent was a Believer when he was born, and Baptized when adult, by Mr. <span class="hi">Earl</span> the Presbyterian Miniſter at <span class="hi">Goſport,</span> by Dipping, being about 40 years of Age. And this was done by the Advice of ſeveral of their Miniſters, particularly Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Williams.</span> His Name is <span class="hi">Joſeph Fox;</span> he is a near Neighbour of ours. And they did it either by the Commiſſion, or, without regard to it, I know not which; that they beſt know.</p><p>And by another hand I have this Account.</p><p>We have alſo thought fit to acquaint you with the Perſon, and his Name, who was Baptized by the Presbyterians at <span class="hi">Goſport;</span> which is as followeth: <span class="hi">It was Mr.</span> Joſeph Fox, <span class="hi">living in</span> Goſ­port; <span class="hi">who being (by our Brother</span> Duke) <span class="hi">deſired to anſwer him one thing, which was, Whether, when he was Bap­tized by Mr.</span> Earl, <span class="hi">it was done by Dipping the whole Body under Water? And he ſaid, it was; and that in the Preſence of four Presbyterian Miniſter<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> Thi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> was acknowledged by him to our Brother <span class="hi">Duke</span> on the <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> of <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> 16<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>6-9. And we do deſire you (if you think <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> in ſome part of the <span class="hi">Diſpute,</span> that the World may <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> acquainted with that Proceed­ing of theirs.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e703"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> Now by this Action of theirs, if they believe it to be according to the Commiſſion, then they juſtify our Practice; if they do it for any by-end, without believing it to be according to God's Word, then (as Mr. <span class="hi">Calvin</span> ſaith) the whole Action is but a Sport.</p><p>Now, that Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> can have no other Thoughts of it, doth evidently appear from his own Words: for in his Sermon preachd at <span class="hi">Portſmouth</span> Nov. <span class="hi">10. 1698.</span> he ſaith, <span class="hi">It is not like­ly that that God that will have mercy and not ſacrifice, would inſtitute an Ordinance ſo prejudicial to the Bodies of Men: and that it's very unlikely that</span> Dipping, <span class="hi">which when­ever it is mentioned, is uſed as a Token of God's</span> Vengeance, <span class="hi">ſhould in this Sacrament be uſed as a Token of his Mercy. Where you read of</span> Dipping, <span class="hi">you find it mentioned in a way of Wrath and Vengeance. Thus the old World was Dip'd and Drowned for their Sins: God's Vengeance followed them, and they ſunk as Lead in the mighty Waters. Thus the</span> Egyptians <span class="hi">were Dip'd and Drowned in the</span> Red Sea. <span class="hi">Thus the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come down from Heaven, to render Vengeance on his Adverſaries; cloathed with Gar­ments Dip'd in blood,</span> Rev. 19. 13. [Here Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> hath rendred that word <span class="hi">Dip'd</span> to inveigh and ridicule our Practice of <span class="hi">Dipping,</span> although he could object againſt it when I gave it for an Inſtance.] But he goes on, ſaying, <span class="hi">You find ſtill</span> Dipping <span class="hi">repreſents in Scripture God's Vengeance and Diſpleaſure. And ſo I ſay it is very unlikely, that what was always uſed as a Token of his Diſpleaſure, ſhould in the New Teſtament be uſed as a Token of Mercy. So that it is not neceſſary that</span> Dipping <span class="hi">be uſed in Baptiſm.</span></p><p>To which I give this for Anſwer.</p><p>1. If it be ſo as he ſaith, then it was altogether unneceſſary that Mr. <span class="hi">Erle</span> (by his Conſent) ſhould dip Mr. <span class="hi">Fox's</span> whole Body under the Water.</p><p>2. That it was not done in Mercy to him, thus to Baptize him; but in Vengeance, and as a Token of God's Diſpleaſure.</p><p>3. That the Baptiſm practiſed by <span class="hi">John the Dipper,</span> and that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, was not an Ordinance inſtituted of God in a way of Mercy, but appointed for the People in a way of Wrath and Vengeance: for I have given him a cloud of Witneſ­ſes, that they did adminiſter it by Dipping the whole Body un­der the Water.</p><p>4. By this he doth condemn and ridicule all thoſe learned Prote­ſtants I have mentioned; with many others that might be named. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e789"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> And the Divines of the <span class="hi">Church of England</span> (as well as we) who appoint <span class="hi">Dipping</span> as the best way of Baptizing (and <span class="hi">Sprin­kling</span> only in caſe of Weakneſs) and was uſed by them formerly as their frequent Practice; and is aſſerted by ſome of their greateſt Divines, to be the old and beſt way of Baptizing: and is to this day the conſtant Practice of the Greek Church.</p><p>I am alſo well aſſured from ſome other hands, that, upon the 25th of <span class="hi">Febr.</span> laſt, a few days after the <span class="hi">Diſpute,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> ſaid in the Preſence of divers Perſons, That to ſatisfy a Scrupu­lous Conſcience he would adminiſter Baptiſm by <span class="hi">Dipping.</span> Whereupon Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> askt him if he would do it to anſwer a Scrupulous Conſcience without God's Word? And he anſwered No. And I have reaſon to conclude that Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> may believe that <span class="hi">Dipping</span> is the right way of Baptizing, whatever he might ſay in the time of the <span class="hi">Diſpute;</span> becauſe he did ſay to divers perſons, That if it had been in a private Conference, where there had been but a few Perſons of a ſide, he ſhould have made ſeve­ral Conceſſions, which he was not willing to make in ſo great an Aſſembly. And therefore I will not charge thoſe extravagant Expreſſions of Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span>'s upon him; <span class="hi">i. e.</span> That <span class="hi">Dipping</span> was always uſed as a Token of Diſpleaſure. And ſurely Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> had mightily forgot himſelf when he ſaid ſo: for <span class="hi">Naa­man</span> the <span class="hi">Syrian</span> was commanded to Dip himſelf, not in a way of Vengeance and Wrath, but in a way of Mercy: and he found it to be ſo; for he was perfectly cured of his Leproſie thereby. I would adviſe Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> to read over <span class="hi">Rom. 2. 1, 2, 3.</span> and conſider how ſharply the Apoſtle reproves ſuch that condemn o­thers, and yet do the ſame things themſelves; and ſaith, <span class="hi">Thou art inexcuſable, O Man, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things.</span></p><p>How can he, or any of them, condemn our Practice, when themſelves can do it to ſatisfie a <span class="hi">Scrupulous Conſcience,</span> or, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> And eſpecially Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh,</span> who confeſſes it to be according to the Word of God? And Mr. <span class="hi">Erle</span> hath done it by their Conſent.</p><p>I ſhall now give you an Account from another hand written from <span class="hi">Goſport,</span> in which (after he hath ſignified his reſpects to me, <span class="hi">&amp;c.)</span> he thus ſaith;</p><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><p><span class="hi">Although they look on your Argu­ments to be of little weight, yet we think them to be of too great weight for them to anſwer with all their Cunning. I hope thoſe that were unprejudic'd will receive ſome Light, though they endeavoured (as much as in them lay) to dar­ken <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e898"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=31621&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> Counſel with their mutinous Carriage.

But my Friend proceeds, ſay­ing, <span class="hi">I hope this Account I have herewith ſent you, will come ſafe to your hands; wherein you may ſee ſome of their Cu­rioſity, whereby they ſay they have confounded your Sophi­ſtry. Four things I obſerved in their Proceedings, which (to me) condemned their Cauſe.</span></p><p><span class="hi">I. The want of ſo much as one bare Inſtance in Scrip­ture to confirm their Practice of Infant Baptiſm.</span></p><p><span class="hi">II. When they required an Inſtance of a Believers Child Baptized when adult; and promiſed when produced they would give us the Cauſe: which Inſtance was given, and yet they perſiſted in it as before.</span></p><p><span class="hi">III. Their appealing to the People to give their Aſſent that they were ſatisfied with Mr</span> Leighs <span class="hi">Argument from</span> Matth. 19. 4. Of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven, <span class="hi">by holding up their hands: and it was obſerved there were but few that did hold up their hands in compariſon of ſo great a Multitude; ſup­poſed by ſome not to be one in fifty, and by others, a much fewer number: ſo that they were far from having the Opi­nion of the People on their ſide by way of Approbation, whatever they may ſay of themſelves; which was not a little Mortification to them.</span></p><p><span class="hi">IV. When they could not obtain it by Right, they would have it be theirs by might.
