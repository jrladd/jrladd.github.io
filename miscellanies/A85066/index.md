## 1\. Faithful CORIDON; Or, Coy Phillis Conquer'd by Kind Cupids Aſſiſtance.

When Damſels Fair doth thus Enſnare,

And win their Lovers heart,

Yet with a Frown can run him down,

Then Cupid takes his Part.

To the Tune of, When May was in her Youthful dreſs.

### 1.1.

This may be Printed.

R. L. S.

[...]

I.

NOw am I toſt on waves of Love,

here like a Ship that's under Sail,

No kind entreaties will not move

my Love to ſend one pleaſant Gale:

She is an Angel in mine Eye,

and Beauty flows in e'ry vein,

Yet I lye wounded fatally,

and by the Dart of her Diſdain.

II.

The luſture of her Beauty bright,

hath kindled ſuch a ſecret flame

Within my breaſt, that day and night,

I needs muſt call upon her Name;

Fair Phillis, Phillis too unkind,

why am I Baniſht in Exile,

If thou wilt eaſe a grieved mind,

then ſend my heart a gentle ſmile.

III.

Was ſhe as kind as ſhe was Fair,

ſhe ſoon would ſend me ſome relief,

And eaſe my mind of grief and care,

and vaniſh all the Clouds of grief:

But yet alas, it is in vain,

my Love ſhe evermore defies,

Though I in ſorrow here complain,

yet ſhe reſolv'd to Tyranize.

IV.

Aſſiſt me Cupid with thy aid,

and let me not be overthrown,

Do thou her gentle heart invade,

when ſhe is ſilent all alone:

When her Enc̄hanting eyes doth cloſe▪

and all her ſences are at reſt,

When ſhe is in her Night repoſe,

then ſeize the Cloſet of her breaſt.

V.

Then Cupid took his Dart in hand,

not fearing then to make her yield,

He did not long diſputing ſtand▪

e're he ſubdu'd and won the field;

When Phillis frown'd her heart betray'd,

and yet no creature could ſhe ſee,

She like a Penſive Lover ſaid,

what ſudden change is wrought in me.

VI.

Then many ſighs and tears ſhe ſpent,

in ſorrow for her Deareſt dear,

Her yielding heart did then relent,

ſweet Coridon would thou wert here▪

Sure pride did over-ſway my heart,

cauſing Ambition ſo to Reign,

But ſince I feel Loves fatal ſmart,

for Coridon I do complain.

VII.

Now when it plainly did appear,

that ſhe in ſorrows did condole,

This joyful tydings to his ear,

revived then his fainting Soul;

The vail of grief and heavineſs,

no longer ſeemed to remain,

No tongue was able to expreſs

the joys of her beloved Swain.

VIII.

He then Embraſt her in his arms,

and joyfully they did compleat

The moſt indeared pleaſant charms,

with vows and tender kiſſes ſweet;

Thus many fair expreſſions paſt,

and Phillis vowing thus did ſay,

As long as ever life doth laſt,

i'le be as conſtant as the day.
