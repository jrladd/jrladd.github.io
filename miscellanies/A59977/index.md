### 1.1. THE SCENE

A Forest, on the side of a Hill a faire house representing an Inne or Taverne,
out of which cometh an Host, being a jolly spright­ly old man; his Cap turn'd
up with Crim­son; his Doublet Fustian, with Jerkin and hanging sleeves, Trunk
Hose of Russet, Stockings yellow, cross gartered; after him a Chamberlain.

FIRST ENTRY.

HO.

Are all things in their preparation

For my immortall guests?

Ch.

Nothing is wanting

That doth concern my Province sir, I am

Your Officer above staires. The great Chamber

With the two wooden Monuments to sleep in

(That weigh six load of Timber, sir) are ready.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=3)That for the
[...]ce D'amour, whom we call Cupid,

I have trimm'd artificially with Roses,

And his Mother's Mirtle. But I have

Committed Sacriledge to please the other,

Death does delight in Ew, and I have rob'd

A Church-yard for him. Are you sure they'l come

To night? I would fain see this Dwarfe call'd Cupid,

For t'other I look on him in my fancy,

Like a starv'd Goblin.

Ho.

Death. I must confesse,

Cuts not so many inches in the Say

As our last Venison, 'tis a thin-chap'd hound,

And yet the Cormorant is ever feeding.

Ch.

But good sir resolve me,

Are they good spirited Guests? will they tipple

To elevation? do they scatter metall

Upon the VVaiters? will they rore, and fancy

The Drawers, and the Fiddles, till their pockets

Are empty as our neighbours drone? and after

Drop by degrees their wardrobe? and in the morning,

VVhen they have day-light to behold their nakedness,

VVill they with confidence amaze the streets?

And in their shirts, to save their pickel'd credits,

Pretend a Race, and trip it like fell footmen?

These rantings were the Badges of our Gentry,

But all their dancing daies are done I fear.

Ho.

These were the garbs, and motions late in fashion

With humorous mortalls; but these guests are of

No humane race.

Ch.

[[Page 3]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=3)

Pray what attendance have they?

Ho.

Love has two

Gentlemen, that wait on him in his Chamber,

Of speciall trust, he cannot act without them.

Ch.

Their names sir, I beseech you?

Ho.

Folly and Madness.

Ch.

A pair of precious instruments,

Sure they are well descended sir.

Ho.

The fool

Could ride a hundred mile in his own Pedegree,

And give as many Coats—

Ch.

Fooles coats, there are

Enough to weare them.

Ho.

As he had acres in

Eleven fat Lordships,

And plaid at duck and drake with Gold, like Pibbles.

Ch.

Was this man born a fool?

Ho.

No, but his keeping

Company with Philosophers undid him,

Who found him out a Mistris they call'd Fame,

And made him spend halfe his estate in Libraries,

Which he bestowed on Colledges, tooke the toy

Of building Quadrangles, kept open house,

And fell at last most desperately in love

VVith a poor dairy maid, for which he was beg'd—

Ch.

A Foole?

Ho.

And leads the the Van in Cupid's Regiment.

Ch.

VVhat was the Mad-man sir?

Ho.

[[Page 4]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=4)

A Thing was born to a very fair per annum,

And spent it all in Looking-glasses.

Ch.

How?

That's a project I never heard on, Looking-glasses?

How many did he break sir in a day?

Ho.

They broke him rather, in the right understand­ing,

For Nature having given him a good face,

The man grew wilde with his own admirations,

And spent his full means upon Flatterers,

That represented him next to an Angell.

Thus blown up, he tooke confidence to court

A Lady of noble blood, and swelling fortune;

Within three daies fell sick of the small Pox,

And on the fourth run mad, with the conceit

His face, when he recover'd, would be like

A countrey Cake, from which some Children had

New pick'd the plumms.

Ch.

A brace of pretty Beagles.

Ho.

They are here.

Ch.

I see not Death.

Ho.

He's the last thing we look for.

[[Page 5]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=4)Enter Cupid,
Folly, Madness; the Hoste joynes with them in a Dance.

SONG.

THough little be the God of Love,

Yet his Arrows mighty are,

And his Victories above

What the valiant reach by War,

Nor are his limits with the skie,

O're the milky way he'll fly,

And somtimes wound a Diety.

Apollo once the Python slew,

But a keener Arrow flew

From Daphne's eye, and made a wound

For which the God no Balsome found;

One smile of Venus too did more

On Mars, than Armies could before;

If a warme fit thus pull him down,

How will she ague-shake him with a frown;

Thus Love can fiery spirits tame,

And when he please cold Rocks inflame.

Enter Death, he danceth the second Entrie, after which he speakes.

De.

Holla! within!

Enter Chamberlain.

Ch.

You are welcome Gentlemen; ha?

[[Page 6]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=5)Quarter, oh
quarter, I am a friend sir,

A moveable belonging to this Tenement

Where you are expected, Gupid is come already,

And supp'd, and almost drunk, We ha' reserv'd

According to order, for your palate, sir,

The Cockatrices Eggs, the cold Toad-Pie,

Ten dozen of Spiders and Adders tongues

Your servant Famine, sir, bespoke.

De.

Live, live.

Exit.

Ch.

I thanke you sir; a curse upon his Physnomy;

How was I surpriz'd? twas high time to comfort me,

I felt my life was melting downward.

Death, oh Death.

within.

Ch.

Who's that? I do not like the voice. What art?

Enter Despair with a Halter.

Des.

A miserable thing.

Ch.

I, so thou seem'st;

Ha'st not a name?

Des.

My name, sir, is Despair.

Ch.

Despair, my time's not come yet, what have I

To do with thee? what com'st thou hither for?

Des.

To find out Death; Life is a burthen to me;

I have pursu'd all Paths to find him out,

And here ith' Forrest had a glimpse on him,

But could not reach him with my feet, or voice;

I would fain dye, but Death flies from me, sir.

Ch.

I wonder you should travell in the Forest,

[[Page 7]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=5)And among so
many Trees find none convenient,

Having the tackling ready, 'bout your neck too.

Some great affairs take up the Devills time,

He cannot sure attend these low employments,

Hee's busie 'bout Leviathans. I know not,

Ther's somthing in't; you have not made your VVill sure.

Des.

Yes sir, I carry it wo'me, it wants nothing

But his name, and my subscription.

Ch.

VVhose name?

Des.

His name I mean to make my Heir.

Ch.

VVhose that?

Des.

That charitable man

VVill bring Death to me, there's a blank left for him,

And if you please to do me, sir, the office,

Even you shall be the man; I have profest

An Usurerer this fifty years, and upwards,

The VVidows and sad Orphans, whose estates

I have devoured, are croaking in my Conscience.

Ch.

And shall he be your Heir that does this feat?

To make you acquainted with this Canniball

You talk of?

Des.

Oh my happiness.

Ch.

I'le do it.

But I believe you are sorry for your baseness,

Your Rapines and Extortions—

Des.

Mistake not,

am sorry for no mischief I have done,

That would come neer Repentance, which you know

[[Page 8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=6)Cures all
the akings of the Soul. If I

Could but be sorry, Death were of no use to me.

Ch.

Keep ye of that mind, you say very right sir,

I'le try what I can do

With Death, to do your Conscience a courtesy,

He's now within our house; I'le bring you pen

And ink to write my name too, honest Father.

Des.

Thou art my dearest child, take all my blessings.

Ch.

Here's like to be a Fortune.

Exit.

Des.

I want strength

To climb, I see a very pretty twig else

He climbs

And space for a most comfortable swing,

'Tis a hard case the Devill will not help

At a dead lift.

He falls.

O my Sciatica.

I have broke my spectacles, and both my hips

Are out of joint, help—

Enter Chamberlain with abottle of Wine.

Ch.

Death will be with you presently, the last course

Is now on the Table that you may not think

The time long, I have brought you▪ ha? rise up sir.

Des.

Alas, I have had a fall, I was indeavouring

To do the meritorious work, and hang

My self, for Death me thought was long a coming,

But my foot slipt.

Ch.

Alas what pitty 'twas?

If I had thought your Soul had been in such

Haste, I would have given you a lift before

I went.

Des.

[[Page 9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=6)

It was my zeal.

Ch.

Alas it seemed so,

You might have tooke the River with more ease,

The stream would have convey'd you down so gently,

You should not feel which way your soul was going.

But against the frights, Death might bring with him,

I have brought you a bottle of wine. I'le begin sir.

He drinks,

Des.

Would it were poyson.

Ch.

So would not I, I thank you,

'Tis pure blood of the Grape.

Des.

Wine?

Ch.

A [...] my charge, I know you do not use

To pay for Nectar,

I bestow it sir.

Des.

That's kindly said, I care not if I taste—

Ch.

I'th' mean time please you, I'le peruse the Will,

I can put in my own name, and make it fit

For your subscription—what's here?—

Reads.

Ha? a thousand pound in Jewells—in ready money

Ten thousand more—Land—ha' preserve my senses.

I'le write my name and thank Heaven afterwards.

—Here sir, before you can subscribe, the Gentleman

Will come and kill you to your hearts content.

Des.

Hum! this foolish wine has warm'd me, what d'ee

Call the name on't?

Ch.

Sack.

Des.

Sack, my truly son—

Ch.

Nay sir make hast, for Death will be here instantly.

Des.

[[Page 10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=7)

At his own leisure, I would not be troublesome▪

Now I do know his lodging, I can come

Another time.

Ch.

But the VVill Father, you may write now—

Des.

Deeds are not vigorous without legall witnesses;

My Scrivener lives at the next Town, and I

Do find my body in a disposition

To walk a mile or two. Sack d'ee call it?

How strangely it does alter my opinion?

Ch.

VVhy? have you no mind to hang your self?

Des.

I thank you,

I find no inclination.

Ch.

Sha'not I be your Heir then?

Des.

In the humour

And spirit I now feel in Brain and Body,

I may live—to see you hang'd; I thank you heartily.

Ch.

But you will have the conscience, I hope,

To pay me for the wine, has wrought this miracle.

Des.

Your free gift I remember, you know, I use not

To pay for Nectar, as you call it. Yet

I am not without purpose to be gratefull,

Some things shall be corrected in my VVill,

In the mean time, if you'l accept of a

Gives him the Halter.

Small Legacy, this Hemp is at your service,

And it shall cost you nothing, I bestow it.

VVe men of money, worn w [...]nd cares,

Drink in new life, from VVin [...] costs us nothing.

[[Page 11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=7)Farewell,
and learn this Lesson from Despair,

Give not your Father Sack to be his Heir.

Ch.

Not a tear left? would's brains were in the bottle.

Exit.

SONG.

VIctorious men of Earth, no more

Proclaime how wide your Empires are;

Though you bind in every shore,

And your triumphs reach as far

as Night or Day,

Yet you proud Monarchs must obey,

And mingle with forgotten ashes, when

Death calls ye to the croud of common men.

Devouring Famine, Plague, and War,

Each able to undo Man-kind,

Death's servile Emissaries are,

Nor to these alone confin'd,

He hath at will

More quaint and subtle waies to kill.

A smile or kiss, as he will use the art,

Shall have the cunning skill to break a heart.

[[Page 12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=8)Enter
Chamberlain.

Ch:

Ho Master, Master.

Enter Hoste.

Ho.

What's the mátter?

Ch.

Nothing but to ask you, whether you be

Alive or no, or whether I am not

My own ghost, that thus walk and haunt your house.

Ho.

Thou lookest frighted.

Ch.

Death and his train are gone,

I thank Heaven he's departed; I slept not

One wink to Night, nor durst I pray aloud,

For fear of waking Death; but he, at Midnight,

Calls for a Cup to quench his thirst, a Bowl

Of Blood I gave him for a mornings draught,

And had and Ague all the while he drank it.

At parting, in my own defence, and hope

To please him, I desired to kisse his hand,

VVhich was so cold, o'th' sudden sir, my mouth

Was frozen up, which as the Case stood

Then with my Teeth, did me a benefit,

And kept the dancing bones from leaping out,

At length, fearing for ever to be speechless,

I us'd the strength of both my hands to open

My lips, and now feel'd eve [...] I spake

Drop from it like an Icycl [...]

Ho.

This cold

Fit will be over; what said Cupid?

Ch.

[[Page 13]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=8)

He

Was fast asleep.

Ho.

The Boy went drunk to bed,

Death did not wake him?

Ch.

It was not necessary in point of reckoning.

Death was as free as any Emperour,

And payes all where he comes, Death quits all scores.

I have the summa totalis in my pocket.

But he without more ceremony left

The house at morning twilight.

Ho.

Ha? they knock—

Get thee a cup of Wine to warm thy intralls.

Exit Chamb.

Though Love himself be but a water-drinker,

His train allow themselves rich Wines. Your Fool

And Madman is your onely guests to Taverns,

And to Excesse; this Licence time affords,

When Masters pay, their servants drink like lords.

Enter Chamberlin.

Ch.

Sir, they call for you, Cupid's up, and ready.

And looks as fresh, as if he had known no surfeit

Of Virgins tears, for whose fair satisfaction,

He broke his Leaden shafts, and vows hereafter

To shoot all flames of love into their servants.

There are some Musick come, to give his godship

Good morrow, so he means to hear one Song,

And then he takes his Progress.

Ho.

I attend him.

Exit.

Ch.

But I have made my own revenge upon him,

For the hard-hearted baggage that he sent me;

And Death I have serv'd a trick for all his huffing.

They think not what Artillery they carry

Along with them, I have chang'd their Arrows.

[[Page 14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=9)How Death
will fret to see his fury cozen'd?

But how will Love look pale, when he shall find

What a Mortality his Arrows make

Among the Lovers? let the God look to't,

I have put it past my care, and not expect

To see them agen, or should I meet with Death,

I shall not fear him now; for Cupid, if

Lovers must onely by his Arrows fall,

I'm safe, for Ladies I defie you all.

SONG.

STay Cupid, whither art thou flying?

Pitty the pale Lovers dying.

They that honour'd thee before, Will no more

At thy Altar pay their vowes.

O let the weeping Virgins strow,

In stead of Rose, and Myrtle boughs,

Sad Ew, and funeral Cypress now.

Unkind Cupid leave thy killing,

These are all thy Mothers Doves,

Oh do not wound such noble Loves,

And make them bleed that should be billing.

### 1.2.

[[Page 15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=9)

The Scene is changed into a pleasant Garden, a Fountain in the midst of it.
Walks and Arbours, delightfully exprest, in divers places, Ladies la­menting
over their Lovers slain by Cupid, who is discover'd flying in the Aire.

Enter a Lover playing upon a Lute, Courting his Mistris; they dance.

Enter Nature in a white Robe, a Chaplet of Flowers, a green Mantle fringed
with Gold, her hair loose they start and seem troubled at her Entrance.

Na.

Flie, slie my Children, love that should preserve

And warm your hearts, with kind and active

Is now become your enemy, a murderer.

This Garden that was once your entertainment

[[Page 16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=10)VVith all
the beauty of the Spring is now

By some strange curse upon the shafts of Cupid,

Design'd to be a Grave; look every where

The noble Lovers on the ground lie bleeding,

By frantick Cupid slain; into whose wounds,

Distracted Virgins pour their tears so fast,

That having drein'd their fountains, they present

Their own pale Monuments; while I but relate

This story, see, more added to the dead.

Oh slie and save your selves, I am your Parent

Nature, that thus advise you to your safeties.

Enter Cupid, he strikes the Lover.

He's come already.

Lover.

Ha? what Winter creeps

Into my heart?

Na.

He faints, 'tis now too late,

Some kinder God call back the winged Boy,

And give him eyes to look upon his murders.

Nature grows stiff with horrour of this spectacle;

If it be Death to love, what will it be

When Death it self must act his cruelty?

Enter Death.

And here he comes, what Tragedies are next?

[[Page 17]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=10)Enter old
Men and Women with Crutches.

Na.

Two aged pair, these will be fit for death,

They can expect but a few minutes more

To wear the heavy burden of their lives.

Death strikes them with his Arrow, they admiring one ano­ther, let fall their
Crutches, and embrace.

Exit Death.

Na.

Astonishment to Nature, they throw off

All their infirmities, as young men do

Their aery upper garments. These were the

Effects of Cupids Shafts; prodigious change!

I have not patience to behold 'em longer.

Exit.

They dance with Antique postures, expressing▪ Rurall Courtship.

SONG.

VVHat will it Death advance thy name

Upon cold Rocks to waste a flame,

Or by mistake to throw

Bright Torches into pits of Snow?

Thy rage is lost,

And thy old killing Frost▪

[[Page 18]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=11)With thy
Arrows thou maist try

To make the young or aged bleed, But indeed

Not compell one heart to die.

CHORUS.

O Love! oh Death! be it your fate

Before you both repent too late to meet and trie

Upon your selves, your sad Artillerie.

So Death may make Love kind again,

Or cruell Death by Love be slain.

Enter six Gentlemen armed as in the field to fight three against three; To
them Death, He strikes them with his Ar­row, and they preparing to charge,
meet one another, and embrace.

They dance.

SONG.

CHange, oh change your fatall bows,

Since neither knows

The vertue of each others Darts;

Alas, what will become of hearts

[[Page 19]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=11)If it
prove

A Death to Love,

We shall find

Death will be cruell to be kind:

For when he shall to Armies fly,

Where men think blood too cheap to buy

Themselves a name,

He reconciles them, and deprives

The valiant men of more then lives,

A Victory, and Fame.

Whilst Love deceiv'd by these cold shafts, in steed,

Of curing wounded hearts, must kill indeed.

CHORUS.

Take pitty Gods, some ease the world will find,

To give young Cupid eyes, or strike Death blind.

Death should not then have his own will.

And Love, by seeing men bleed, leave off to kill.

Enter Chamberlin leading two Apes.

Ch.

Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes,

All you that delight to be merry come see

My brace of Court Apes, for a need we be three;

I have left my old trade of up and down stairs

And now live by leading my Apes unto Fairs.

Will you have any sport? draw your money, be quick sir,

And then come aloft Jack, they shall shew you a trick sir.

Now▪ am I in my Naturall Condition,

For I was born under a wandring Planet;

I durst no longer stay with my old Master,

[[Page 20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=12)For fear
Cupid and Death be reconcil'd

To their own Arrows, and so renew with me

Some precious acquaintance.

Enter Death, He strikes the Chamberlin.

Ch.

Oh, my heart,

'Twas Death I fear, I am paid then with a vengeance;

My dear Apes do not leave me, ha? come neer—

What goodly shapes they have, what lovely faces!

Ye Twins of beauty, where were all those graces

Obscur'd so long? what Cloud did interpose

I could not see before this Lip, this Nose?

These eyes? that do invite all hearts to wooe, them,

Brighter then Stars; Ladies are nothing to them,

Oh let me here pay down a Lovers duty;

Who is so mad to dote on Womans beauty?

Nature doth here her own complexion spread,

No borrow'd Ornaments of white and red;

These cheeks were no adulterate mixtures on them,

To make them blush as some do, fie upon them!

Look what fair cheries on their Lips do grow?

Black cherries, such as none of you can shew,

That boast your beauties, let me kiss your a—

[[Page 21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=12)Enter a
Satyr, that strikes him on the shoul­der, and takes away his Apes.

What's that? a shot i'th' shoulder too? ha.

What will become of me now? oh my Apes!

The Darlings of my heart are ravish'd from me.

He beckons, and courts them back with passionate postures.

No? not yet? nor yet hard-hearted Apes?

I must despair for ever to enjoy them.

Despair? that name puts me in mind,

He looks in his pocket, and pulls out the halter.

'Tis here;

VVelcome dear Legacy, I see he was

A Prophet that bestowed it; how it fits me?

As well as if the Hangman had took measure.

'Tis honour in some men to fight and die

In their fair Ladies quarrel, and shall I

Be 'fraid to hang my self in such a cause?

Farewell my pretty Apes, when Hemp is ti'd

Drop tears apace, and I am satisfi'd.

[[Page 22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=13)A Dance of
the Satyre and Apes.

Upon the sudden a solemn Musick is heapd, and Mercury seen descend­ing upon a
Cloud, at whose ap­proach, the other creep in amazed. In a part of the Scene
within a Bow­er, Nature discover'd sleeping.

Mer.

Hence ye prophane, and take your dwellings up

Within some Cave, that never saw the Sun,

Whose Beams grow pale, and sick to look upon you;

This place be sacred to more noble Objects,

And see where Nature tir'd with her Complaints

To Heaven for Death and Cupid's Tyranny

Upon a bank of smiling Flowers lies sleeping,

Cares that devour the peace of other bosomes,

Have by an over charge of sorrow wrought

Her heart into a calm, where every sense

Is bound up in a soft repose, and silence;

Be her Dreams all of me. But to my Embassie.

Cupid, wheresoe'r thou be,

The Gods lay their commands on thee,

In pain of being banish'd to

The unfrequented shades below

At my first summons to appear.

Cupid, Cupid.

[[Page 23]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=13)Enter
Cupid.

Cup.

I am here,

What send the Gods by Mercury?

Mer.

Thy shame and horrour. I remove

This mist.

He unblinds him.

Now see in every Grove

What slaughter thou hast made, all these

Fond Cupid were thy Votaries,

Does not their blood make thine look pale?

All slain by thee, 'two▪ not prevail

To urge mistakes, thy fact appears;

Jove, and the Gods have bow'd their ears

To groning Nature, and sent me

From their high Christall Thrones to see

What blood, like a dire Vapour rise,

Doth spread his wings to blind the eyes

Of Heaven and Day; and to declare

Their Justice and Immortall care

Over the lower world, but stay

Another must his fate obey.

Death heretofore, the look'd-for close

To tedious life, the long repose

To wearied Nature, and the gate

That leads to Mans eternall fate,

I in the name of every God,

Command thee from thy dark aboad,

As thou wilt fly their wrath, appear

At my first Summon—

[[Page 24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=14)Enter
Death.

De.

I am here.

Mer.

Nature awake, and with thy sleep

Shake off the heavy Chains that keep

Thy Soul a Captive.

Nat.

Mercury?

Or am I still in Dreams?

Mer.

Thy Eye

Take truce with tears, see much abus'd

Nature, whom thou hast long accus'd,

Leave thy wonder, and attend

VVhat the Gods by Hermes send.

But first I charge you to resign

Your fatall Shafts.

Cup.

I, these are mine.

They change.

Mer.

Cupid, the Gods do banish thee

From every palace, thou must be

Confin'd to Cottages, to poor,

And humble Cells, Love must no more,

Appear in Princes Courts, their heart

Impenetrable by thy Dart,

And from softer influence free

By their own wills must guided be.

Cup.

I shall obey.

Mer.

Death, thou maist still

Exercise thy power to kill,

With this limit, that thy rage

Presume not henceforth to engage

On Persons, in whose brest, divine

Marks of Art, or Honour shine;

[[Page 25]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=14)Upon
these, if thy malice trie,

They may bleed, but never die;

These are not to be overcome,

Above the force of Age or Tomb.

Is Nature pleas'd?

Na.

The Gods are just.

Mer.

To this you both submit?

C. D.

We must.

Mer.

Ye are dismist.

Exeunt.

Nat.

But Mercury,

What satisfaction shall I have

For noble Children in the Grave

By Cupid slain?

Mer.

They cannot be

Reduc'd to live again with thee,

And could thy fancy entertain

In what blest seats they now remain,

Thou wouldst not wish them here.

Na.

Might I

With some knowledge bless my eye,

Nature would put on Youth.

Mer.

Then see

Their blest condition.

### 1.3.

The Scene is changed into Elizium, where the grand Masquers, the slain Lovers
appear in glorious Seats and Habits.

Na.

Where am I?

The World no such Perfection yields.

Mer.

These are the fair Elizian fields.

SONG.

OPen blest Elizium Grove,

Where an eternall Spring of Love

Keeps each beauty fair, these shades

No chill Dew or Frost invades;

Look how the Flowers, and every Tree

Pregnant with Ambrosia be;

Neer banks of Violet Springs appear,

Weeping out Nectar every tear;

While the once harmonious Sphears,

(turn'd all to ears)

Now listen to the Birds, whose Quire

Sing every charming Accent higher.

CHORUS.

If this place be not Heaven, one thought can make it,

And Gods by their own wonder led, mistake it.

Na.

[[Page 27]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=29641&page=15)

Oh, who shall guide me hence? old Natures sight

Grows feeble at the brightnesse of this glory.

Mer.

I will be Natures conduct.

Na.

Mercury—be ever honour'd.

Exeunt.

The Grand Dance.

Enter Mercury.

Mer.

Return, return you happy men

To your own blessed Shades agen,

Lest staying long, some new desire

In your calm bosomes raise a fire;

Here are some Eyes, whose every beam

May your wandring hearts inflame,

And make you forfeit your cool Groves,

By being false to your first Loves.

Like a Perfuming gale o'r Flowers,

Now glide again to your own Bowers.

The Curtain falls.

FINIS.
