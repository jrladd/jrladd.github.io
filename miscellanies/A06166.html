These two princely cooples ordained by desteny to high desasters, though their affluence of riches promised them felicitie, yet the influence of the hea­uens intimated their aduersitie; for hauing great signories to bequeath, they had no heires to enioy, accompting this for their only crosse, that they were without children: many were their vowes, but to no auayle; many their prayers, but to little purpose; if phisick might haue made fruitfull, <span class="hi">Editha</span> had been a Mother; if great summs could haue purchast yong sonnes, <span class="hi">Aubert</span> had been a Father. Seuen yeares and more liued they in this sort, the one carelesse of loues delight, the other comfortlesse in that she was barraine, till on a prefixed Saterday, when Nature had powred all her treasures on the earth, <span class="hi">Flora</span> powdered all the medowes with flowres, when the louesick <span class="hi">Zephirus</span> softly breathed, and the tender leaues sweetly bowed, when the sunne played with the waue, &amp; the waue dallyed with the sunne, both enioying an equal simpathy of solace, Duke <span class="hi">Aubert</span> (who from his youth vpwarde was meruailously delighted in y<sup>e</sup> chase) accompanyed with his faire Duchesse, departed out of his Capitall Citie of <span class="hi">Roan,</span> to take his pastance in the Forrest. <span class="hi">Editha</span> (by deuine ordinance) was that day attired, as if she intended to wooe <span class="hi">Lucina</span> to graunt a Sonne, and winne the Norman Duke to get a Sonne.

Midst euery pleight were certayne spheares of Pearles and Diamonds, which with the excel­lencie of their purenesse, gaue no little grace to her hayres perfection: her browes not so hard as Iuorie, but more whi­ter, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e429"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=4">[Page 2]</a></span> intermedled with some delicate vermilion, her eyes in puritie like the Carbunckle, lightning y<sup>•</sup> darkest thoughts in effect like the Leadstone, drawing the most indurate harts, concluding all passions in themselues, in that they were the rootes of passions: her cheekes like two orbes of rubies par­ticipating the whitenes of the Lillie, her lips resembling the Roses, being limits of more wonder than either toong can ex­presse, or eye behold.

In this sort spent they the mor­ning, till about Noonesteede, when the Sunne was in the South, at that time shining in his greatest mightines, <span class="hi">Au­bert</span> being attainted with heate, entered the thickest of the wood, hoping to obtaine some cold shelter, where he might rest himselfe for a while, and rid himselfe of his wearynes.

O Nature, too naturall vnto same, but too negligent on my behalfe, who yeelding the basest tree his blossome, the tallest pine his apple, the weakest stalke his flowre, the wasted fielde his spring, hast bequea­thed increase to all things, and bereaued me of increase: thou hast made mee faire, but vnfortunate, a Princesse, but im­pregnant, making me in desire as ritch as any, in defect as wretched as the most. Oh, hadst thou been as fauourable to mee as to the Lionesse, in bequeathing me one princely sonne, I might then haue exclaimed on Destenie, if I had lost him, and not haue disclaimed delight, in that I euer lack him. But thou art like the veruen (Nature) poyson one wayes, and pleasure an other, feeding me with grapes in shewe lyke to <span class="hi">Darius</span> Uine, but not in substance, lyke those of <span class="hi">Vermandois.</span> Thou art a partiall mistresse, pleased in thy secrecie, peremptorie in thy seueritie.

The hand that gouerneth all things, is deuine: the works of God admit no limits, and his wayes are vnknowne: he ballan­ceth not sinnes by our proportion, nor condemneth by worldly iudgement. Be confident therefore, and serue the Lord in feare and trembling. Suppose all things wicked that is in thee, and confesse thy wickednes beyond measure. Detest that which thou hast pursued: be penitent in that thou hast defaulted. If the Lord looke vpon thee in mercie, thy soule shall feele it, yea, thy raynes shall waxe hote, and thy spirit moued: neyther feare thou if terrour assayle thee beyonde measure, for the hand is mightie that helpeth thee. Dread not my sonne, feare not, boldly disburthen thy minde of vn­cleannes, and powre out thy soule before thy God, and weepe with contrition, for in so doing, assure thee thy teares are lacked vp in his bottle: looke what is betweene the East and West, so farre will he separate thy sinnes from thee, if thou repent thee, <span class="hi">Robert</span> hearing hereof, began to gather hart, but calling to minde what he had before time heard of the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1733"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=18">[Page]</a></span> learned Clearks of <span class="hi">Normandy,</span> how there are some sinnes which are against the holy Ghost which are neyther forgiuen in this life, nor in the life to come, he began to beate his breast, his eyes stared, his heare stoode vpright, and as if he had <span class="hi">Bemboes</span> vision, he began to cast away all hope of mer­cie, crying out in this manner, <span class="hi">ô etiam in spiritum sanctum pec­caui; nulla remissio, sempiterna condemnatio.</span> The ould man hearing this extreame allegation, cast himselfe prostrate on his face, crying out vnto the heauens, <span class="hi">O ah occultis criminibus liberanos domine.</span> Hold back my Sonne, thou art too forward: deferre to presume on that sinne, which thou canst not define, neyther obiect that to thy selfe, which dependeth on the Iudge: thy déedes are written, but to God belongeth mercie.

But the olde man comforted him, and knowing the expedition of his ior­ney, so animated him, that hee presently set forward, in that the louely Moone assisted him with sufficient light: the aged sire conducted him on his way, in which they had not long tra­uailed, but they tooke their leaues the one of the other, &amp; <span class="hi">Ro­bert</span> continually prosecuted his iorney.

During the time that darknesse ouerspred the face of the whole earth, and euery bird beast and fish enioyed the happie benefites of fléepe, the vigi­lant religious couple deuoutly applied themselues to contem­plation, when about the third houre of the night the Recluse was resolued of his penaunce: wherefore vpon the breake of day, when <span class="hi">Robert</span> had arisen from his prayers, he came vnto him, and carying in his countenance the grauitie of a father, and in his heart the sinceritie of a Counceller, he began thus. Yong Prince, if thy contrition for sinne be so compassionate as thou pretendest, and thy zeale to acknowledge the same so accomplished as thou presumest, knowe this that thy danger is lesse and thy benefite the greater, for repentance is a swéete sacrifice, and desire to amend is the way to end the fault. But in that thy offences and follies haue béen extraordinarie, thy punishment must be no lesse, in sufferance whereof thou shalt throughly perceaue the indignitie of thy former sinne. Here­vpon be prescribed him his penaunce: first that hee should eate no meate but that hée receaued from a dogge: secondly, that during seauen yeres he should be dumbe: lastly, for that space of time he should walke in a fooles habite, in acknowledgmēt of his accustomed leawdnesse. <span class="hi">Robert</span> thankfully accepted that which was enioyned him, neither repyning at the hard penance, nor disdayning y<sup>•</sup> flender pittance, but taking humble leaue of the Recluse, hasted himselfe vnto the Citie to satisfie that which was prescribed him, and buying him a fooles habit he walked vp and downe the streetes, enduring the reuilings of children, who cast dirt in his face, scoffed and mocked him, and the more lewd language that they vsed, the more content­ment he receaued, remembring this, that his deserts and pre­sumptions deserued farre more martyrdome: oftentimes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2379"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=24">[Page 22]</a></span> was he reuiled, but deuotion closed his tongue, considering this in himselfe, that in refrayning the same be auoyded much offence. Certaine of his confederate Hermites beholding this madnesse and idle behauiour, came vnto him to comfort him, but he crossing his hands and weeping teares, poynted to the heauens, signifying thereby that hee suffered that crosse for sinning against thē. In short time he became the by word of the Citie, some buffeted him, which hee endured patiently; some others of more charitie offered him foode, which he with gratulation refused, so that no other noise was published through <span class="hi">Rome</span> but of the strange Idiot that was dumbe; the people flocked about him, some praysing his person, some la­menting his ignorance, some greeuing that he was dumbe, othersome laughing at his dotage: thus euery man gaue his seuerall iudgement of him</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.11"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.11. </span><span class="head">How Robert entered the Emperours Court, &amp; how he there liued.</span></h3><p>AT last he entered the Emperours pallace, at such time as with his Nobles he solemnized a most solemne and festiuall day, great was the presse about the table, and many the attendants, but <span class="hi">Robert</span> boldly entered the presence, demeaning himselfe after such a manner, that the Emperour and Princes tooke very great delight in him, he was actiue of bodie, &amp; vaughted excéedingly well, performing such aduen­terous trickes, as the Emperour all amazed inquired what be might be; he made him signes of dumnes, shadowing vn­der colours of delight his intentiue deuotion. Then presented they him meate which he refused, accustoming himselfe at e­uery such offer to make showe of discontent. The Emperour at that time had a faire Greyhound, who for his swiftnes in the chace and seemelines of bodie was highly esteemed, that beholding <span class="hi">Robert</span> fauned vpon him and plaied with him, as if appointed by some diuine instinct to affect him; the Em­perour seeing he refused meate at his haud, cast some pittance at his dogge, where <span class="hi">Robert</span> sodainly strugled for the same and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2413"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=25">[Page]</a></span> greedily fed thereon, which made the lookers on intentiue to sport, to accustome him to that kinde of feeding. The Empe­rour caused him for this cause to be cherished in his own house and tended with diligent care, taking pastime continually to haue <span class="hi">Robin</span> in his presence. At night when the festiuals were finished, <span class="hi">Robert</span> was brought vnto a good bed well furnished, but he refused it, &amp; gathering together certaine locks of straw hee made him a cabbin vnder the staiers of the Emperours pallace, where for seauen yeres space he cōtinually slept with y<sup>e</sup> hound, refusing all other content or delectation. Oftentimes was he priuilie seene to weep bitterly, &amp; when he could get in­to any seuerall place to pray deuoutly on his knees, which be­ing tolde vnto the Emperour, made him more curious to en­quire his progenie, but by no meanes could he vnderstand it, for the good Prince had kept it most secret. Thus may we see that when the minde is withdrawne from worldly delights, (wherewith for the most part wretched men are detayned) all things seeme abiect and vile, except such as lift the soule vnto heauen, and subdue the bodie in his sensualitie. This most fa­mous and renowmed Romane Emperour, among all other his high blessings and Fortunes benefites, had a faire Ladie to his daughter, whose picture if <span class="hi">Praxitiles</span> would describe, or a better Master than <span class="hi">Apelles,</span> hee should rather lacke cun­ning, than lay colours; as beautiful she was as Nature could imagine, and as well formed as she was faire, and no lesse ex­quisite in learning as in lineaments, her onely imperfection was that she was borne dumbe. This noble Princesse cal­led <span class="hi">Emine,</span> was sought vnto by all the Monarkes and vn­married Potentates of the worlde, so was her fame brui­ted abroade, and such was her beautie: among the rest, the Souldan of <span class="hi">Babilon</span> vnderstanding by certaine Italian Merchants the excéeding and surpassing excellence of her person, and receauing from them her picture, hée became woonderfullie surprized in loue, so that neglecting all o­ther pleasures, hee onely setled his minde towardes the attainment of her fauour: Oftentimes presented hée rich <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2464"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=25">[Page 23]</a></span> presents to ordinarie trauaylers, desiring onely to growe famous in the Italian Countries, and he that could but in best words set out <span class="hi">Emines</span> prayse, had a princely recompence. Round about his Pallace was no other posie but <span class="hi">Emine:</span> and in his Oratorie was no other Goddesse but <span class="hi">Emine:</span> if he talked, he talked of <span class="hi">Emine:</span> if he longed, he longed for <span class="hi">Emine:</span> if he wept, he wept for <span class="hi">Emine:</span> thus were all his ioyes metamorphosed into <span class="hi">Emine.</span> It was woonde­rous to sée his disguise in attyre after the Christian man­ner: his desire to be holie after the Christian holynesse, such power hath loue both to alter both the nature and <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>n­ner of life and religion. But leaue we him, and returne we to <span class="hi">Robin,</span> who conuersing continually in the Emperours Court, was at length beheld and fancied by <span class="hi">Emine:</span> and al­though she had not the libertie of speech to expresse his af­fections, yet by the motion of her body, and the cariage of her eye, she published her fancies.

In midst whereof, was placed a daintie and wonderfull Garden, stored with all the ritches of nature, with sweete shades, cleere springs, strange flowres, wholesome hearbs: and in the middle of the same was erected a Temple to <span class="hi">Cupide</span> and <span class="hi">Emine,</span> wherein hir stature made of the purest golde, seemed to stayne all the excellencie of workemanship, for the Paynter had done as much as might be, to describe beawtifull <span class="hi">Emine.</span> Herein he closed himselfe, and hauing all the battlements of the temple made of polished Iuorie, he with a true loues knot interlaced his name with <span class="hi">Emines,</span> being of himselfe excellently seene in portrait. If any one of his Lords resorted vnto him, destrous to know the name of his Goddesse, he answered <span class="hi">Emine:</span> but how he serued, or of what place she was, he durst not tell, fea­ring y<sup>e</sup> barbarous treasons of his greatest subiects. Thus cea­sed that warlike nation their armes, who were beforetime so famous, and he that was woont to fight for signiorie, was now foyled and besotted with loue. The Nobles about him not induring idlenesse, presented themselues before him, seeking to disswade him from his obscuritie, but all in vayne, till <span class="hi">Behenzar,</span> a chiefe <span class="hi">Musulmah</span> in <span class="hi">Bagdet</span> or <span class="hi">Babylon,</span> hum­bling him on his knee, spake in this manner.</p><p>Most royall off-spring of <span class="hi">Mahomet,</span> though thy displea­sure be my death, and thy frowne the ruyne of my fortune, yet knowing my selfe a Subiect, and thy selfe my Soue­raigne, I will labour for thy delight, though it cost me my death.

Oh my Prince, if I deserue fauour, discouer thy fancie, there are remedies for woundes that are knowne, medicines for apparant maladies, but l<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>cers that are con­cealed in the flesh, are not cured but by sharpe Phisick: It is loue, I see it working in thine eyes, which infeebled by the power of thy thoughts, would execute that kindnesse which thy hart can not consent vnto. And what if loue? art thou not Lord of <span class="hi">Babylon,</span> who may commaund? the brauest befriended by great Kings, who haue fayre Concubines? let <span class="hi">Asia</span> be sought out: if <span class="hi">Asia</span> hold thy loue, <span class="hi">Asia</span> shall not keepe her, if <span class="hi">Europe,</span> what may <span class="hi">Europe</span> to thy power: As for sandy <span class="hi">A­phrica,</span> the Sunne is too hote to breed any white coulored <span class="hi">Phaenix:</span> howsoeuer thou loue my Soueraigne, if it be loue, (and that it is loue thy life declareth) certifie thy Princes of thy fancies, commaund them, employ all, send Embassades, present benefites: if all fayle, thy Sword is true loues dart, which shall pierce further with the terror of thine armes, than all the world that attempteth thy countermaund. The Nobles admyring the boldnesse of <span class="hi">Behenzar,</span> and sus­pecting no lesse, cast themselues in generall at his feete, and sware vnto him by a solemne oth neither to contrary him, nor forsake him, till he had atchieued the fulnesse of his ioy, if so it pleased him to discouer the cause of his pensiuenesse. The Souldan marking their incessant suites, and praysing <span class="hi">Be­henzars</span> dutifull obedience, rowsed himselfe from his melan­choly seate, and with a milder countenance began thus.</p><p>I am fortunate in nothing more my noble Péeres, and beloued Princes, than in this, that I haue valiant men to follow me in my Conquests, and vigilant men to counsayle me in my discontents. You require a matter O my compa­nions, which hath cost me much hartbreake, and may procure me much happinesse. It is no ordinarie passion that I feele, or seruile pleasure that I follow. I tye not my thoughts to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2639"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=27">[Page]</a></span> limits, nor my limits conclude my thoughts. My troubles are like the twynnes of <span class="hi">Democritus,</span> augmented at once, counselled by nothing, but by my opinion: I haue the quali­tie of <span class="hi">Salmacis,</span> which being tasted, procureth madnesse, and this qualitie is loue, and this loue in me hath the disposition of the <span class="hi">Hamonian</span> Lake, capable of all formes, but consumed by one, which forme may not be reformed. Ah <span class="hi">Behenzar,</span> well mayst thou accuse myne eyes, for they by a héedl<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>sse glaunce, haue eclipsed my matchles glory. Oh my Princes, I sweare to you by <span class="hi">Mahound</span> whome I honor, by my right hand that neuer fainted, I blushingly confesse I loue, but not so basely as <span class="hi">Haniball,</span> for <span class="hi">Capua</span> contained his, where <span class="hi">Europe</span> admyreth my Mistres. It is fayre <span class="hi">Emine</span> I loue, to whome this Alter is erected, and my vowes are directed. Princes woonder not, <span class="hi">Theagines</span> a Greeke, loued <span class="hi">Cariclia</span> a Moore, &amp; your Souldan a Mahometist, his <span class="hi">Emine</span> a Chri­stian. The ayme of my thoughts is the honor of <span class="hi">Rome:</span> oh sweete <span class="hi">Rome</span> that containeth such an honor, which if I attaine not, it is but your discontents, my death, &amp; if my death, what though: oh happy death if for her grow my durance. This ab­rupt conclusion was followed with such a bitter sigh, as all men expected no other but his finall ouerthrow, or her con­sent: wherevpon his Nobles priuatly, consulted, and by his consent <span class="hi">Behenzar</span> was made Embassalor, and with ritch presents sent to <span class="hi">Rome</span> to craue <span class="hi">Emine</span> in Mariage, and if the repulse should be graunted, the conclusion was, that priuie intelligence should be giuen, and Ships rigged, to the ende that on the sodaine the Souldan might inuade Christen­dome, and rid himselfe of all the obstacles of his happines. These conclusions well liking the Souldan, were briefely debated, the Embassadors dispatched, the Ships rigged, the souldyours leuyed, and the despaire that the Souldan con­ceaued, at the first was turned into a fresh hope, yet the sweet grounds of his pleasant discontents so alluref him, that in seeming to hope, he pretended despaire, and in the absence of his Lords, who intended the

Now at <span class="hi">Rome</span> in stead of beautiful houses were builded strong Bulwarkes; in stead of Pallaces, Palisadoes, and each man was mightily addicted to the safetie of his coun­trie.

But among all the mestfull families, the Emperours Court was most vn­fortunate, where in stead of rich spoyles, the Emperiall cham­bers were replenished with dead and wounded bodies, and confusion seeming to haue elected her habitation in that place, began to infect euery particular person with his poyson. The Empresse bathed in teares, had her eyes almost choaked vp with weeping, and <span class="hi">Emine</span> the flower of beautie seemed like the Rose ouerwashed with ouerlirant shewes, her crimson staines became pale and bleake colours; so much doth sorrow alter both the inward and outward habilities. <span class="hi">Robert</span> agrée­ued in heart to see these discontents, groaned in mind, though he dissembled mirth, practising all meanes possible to delight the Emperour, to mooue laughter to the Empresse, to content <span class="hi">Emine;</span> faine would he haue enterprised armes, but he durst not, fearing it was preiudiciall to his vowe, and so much cou­rage wrought in his heart, that espying his Confessor one day, who by reason of these warres had withdrawne himselfe into the Citie, he by signes shewed his de<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ires to doo the Em­perour seruice.

But the Emperour among the rest was wholly re­uiued with the sight, and yéelding God most humble thankes. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3354"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=32">[Page 30]</a></span> animated his Souldiers to pursue the victorie; many and valiant were the men that fell that day by <span class="hi">Roberts</span> sworde, and had not the night by speedie approach departed both the Armies, the Souldan had that day suffered an vndoubted o­uerthrowe: whereuppon both the Armies sounded the re­treate, and <span class="hi">Robert</span> with all expedition priuilie entered the Citie, where encountering the Recluse his Confessor, he left his Armour with him, and hid his horse in a Monastarie, where the good man was resiant, returning to the Court in his fooles habite: by which time the Emperour with his at­tendants was entered the Citie, and being disarmed sat him downe in great content, discoursing with his Princes and Emperours vppon the affayres of that dayes seruice; great was the noyse throughout the Citie of the white Knights valour, and in Court was no other talke but of the straunge Knight that behaued himselfe so valiantly. The Emperour made great inquisition after him, but by no meanes could vnderstande thereof.</p><p>By this time <span class="hi">Robert</span> and his hound (as was his custome) entered the dyning chamber, playing many pleasant trickes before the Emperour, who tooke thereat wonderfull delight, <span class="hi">Emines</span> eye was continually fixed on him, and whilest the Kings talked of the valiant warriour, she purposely poynted at him. It fortuned in this incountrie that <span class="hi">Robert</span> had a little scratch ouer his right eye, which being but freshly wounded bled a little; the Emperour that loued him deerely, examined who had harmed him; great noyse was there about the Pallace of this iniurie, and no man would be knowne of it, only one Knight knéeling before the Emperour, certified his grace that the knight who had deserued so much in his seruice that day, was wounded in the same place, &amp; that he suspected it was he. <span class="hi">Robert</span> fearing least he should be discouered, began much more to play y<sup>•</sup> Idiot, putting his Cockscomb vpon the Knights head &amp; laughing, which caused all y<sup>e</sup> Princes to take great delight: but <span class="hi">Emine</span> still poynted at him, &amp; if the libertie <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3393"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=33">[Page]</a></span> of her tongue had graunted her meanes to discouer the secre­cie of her thought, <span class="hi">Robert</span> assuredly had at that time been knowne. The Emperour notwithstanding began to gather on these allegations, and desirous to knowe the certaine trueth, priuatly appoynted certaine Knights against the next day to the number of thirtie to attend the sayd Champion; and by some meanes to cause his discouerie. In this manner passed they the euening in delight, till it was bed time, when as the Emperour and Emperesse (after order was gi­uen for the safetie of the Citie) betooke them to their rest, and the other seuerall Lords and Princes to their lodging, at which time <span class="hi">Robert</span> and his hound entered their homely cab­bin, wherein meditating without closing his eyes, the salt teares streamed downe his cheekes in remembrance of his sinnes, in thought of his father, in consideration of his coun­trie: and now came there to his minde how for sixe yeares and mare hée had liued an abiect life, vnworthie his estate, the thought whereof so much abashed him, that it is vnpossible to reckon vp his perplexities: then called hee to minde the kinde effections of <span class="hi">Emine,</span> and his soule bemoned that so per­fect a person should haue so palpable an vnperfection: now applied hée the cause thereof to the Emperours sinne, ac­compting the virgin happie, that by her want of speach esca­ped from many occasions of offence: then recorded hee the effusion of Christian bloud, and of méere compassion in mid­dest of that thought hee wept most bitterly, when the poore kinde beast licked vp his teares. In this sort spent he the night in consideration of many thinges, and in conclusion of the aduenture of his life, for the s<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>fetie of Christendome: whilest the approach of the morning called each one from his <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ouch, and the warning Trompet called out to the fight, their went euery one to arme him, and after they had heard the di­uine seruice, &amp; taken some refection, prepared themselues vnto the fight: In the Souldans Camp all were farre otherwise, for y<sup>•</sup> losse they receaued y<sup>•</sup> day before en<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>enomed their harts, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3443"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=33">[Page 31]</a></span> and made them more vigorous vnto reuenge, each one resol­ued with this Camarado, to subdue, or dye; to conquer, or be confounded. In their lookes were shadowed their tyrannies, and in their hast their hardinesse. Scarcely were the allarms sounded on both sides, but the enemy gaue the charge, and the Souldan inflamed with loue, and inraged with furie, sought by all meanes possible to confound his aduersaries. On euery side were heard the gronings of wounded men, some hauing lost their armes, some their legs, the sonne of­tentimes was trampled vnder the horsse féete of his father, and in these common miseries, nature her selfe stoode amazed to behold the Massacres. The Souldan which way soeuer he trauailed, ouerthrew his resistants, the Emperour was by him vnhorssed and wounded, and had not <span class="hi">Pepin,</span> and <span class="hi">Charles</span> of <span class="hi">Burgundie</span> rescued him at that time, <span class="hi">actum esset de imperio.</span> Certaine men that were lightly wounded, brought no lesse astonishment into the Citie, than was in the battaile, for they aggrauated the discomfiture farre more than it was, repor­ting that the Emperour was vnrecouerably distressed. <span class="hi">Ro­bert</span> hearting of these rumors, hasted to the Recluse, his soule groaned within him, and zeale ouercame him, so that after some deuout prayers, accompanyed with remorsefull teares, he mounted on horsseback, and hauing taken his armes, he so valiantly and furiously entered the fight, that those who beheld him, thought that some tempest had bin stirred vp, and some whirlewind issued from the Citie, in his furie he tooke no regard of person, murthering whomesoeuer he incounte­red: scarce could his horsse stirre himselfe for the multitude of dead men that fell before him: such of the Christians as fled out of the battaile before his entrance, returned vehemently, so that the conflict was renewed with such vigor, as the hea­uens in vehement showers seemed to be weepe the murther. The Emperour beyond all expectation, shewed himselfe va­liant, and approching the place where the Norman Prince fought, he cryed out for extreame ioy: Oh hope of Christen­dome, thou flowre of chiualrie, thou anchor of mine Empire, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3478"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=34">[Page]</a></span> the heauens requite thee: see how old in yeares my person shall accompany thee, how forward I will fight, and inforce thy selfe the more to preuent the desolation of yond Citie. <span class="hi">Robert</span> quickned with his words, departed as if he vnderstood him not, and meeting with the Souldan, gaue him such a stroke on the helmet, that his horsse fell vnto the ground, and he himselfe was wonderfully amazed. The whole band of the Mamelucks seeking to withstand him, were either dissipated or destroyed, and be that thought to gaine y<sup>e</sup> chiefest triumph, enacted the choicest tragedie: in briefe, as the tender blossoms new apparra<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>led by nature, issuing from their stalks as new borne creatures, vpon the violent breath of a Northren wind, are depriued of their beawtie and decayed in their blossome: so the Pagans beholding the forwardnes of the assaylant, and the feeblenesse of their assembly, fled away, both care­lesse of their weale, and recurelesse in their wrack. <span class="hi">Robert</span> seeing the euening approching on, the Christians prowd with victorie, the pursuite hote, the flight hastie, sodainely with­drewe himselfe; for the gentle Westerne winde (a kind loue­mate of the euentide) began with curteous breathings to as­swage his ouergrowne wearinesse, the sunne in the East set in his scarlet rednesse, pretending the beawtie of the succee­ding day, or the windynes of the following night; for which cause, dreading to be be <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>cried, and desirous to escape, (a­scribing all glory to heauens, and not vnto his hand) he so­dainly departed, leauing the Christians to pursue that with swiftnesse, which he had compassed by his sword, but whilst he seeketh to auoyd the furie of his enemie, he is readie to perish through the meanes of amitie, for the thirtie chosen Knightes appointed by the Emperour to descrie him, at such time as he forsooke the battaile, followed him hastelie, and couching their Launces all at once, on sodayne assayled him: he seeing so many attempting him at once, turned his horsse, resoluing to endure the hazard, but finding their armes to be Christian, he spurred his horsse, detesting vtterly to come in know­ledge: <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3515"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=10100&amp;page=34">[Page 32]</a></span> the pursuite was hote, the flight seruent, the follo­wers in despayre, the flyer determined; how often smiled <span class="hi">Robert</span> to himselfe, knowing that he fled before he feared? how often feared they to touch him, that fled from them? in briefe, some one better horssed than the other, seeing that the hazard of their credits depended on their knowledge, hauing the swiftest Horsse, pursued the Norman Prince, and so egerly indeuored, that he gaue him a deepe wound in the thygh, and sodaynely returned to his companyons, knowing, that the bitternesse of the same, and the eager­nesse of his griefe, would soonest disclose the obscuritie of the sufferer.
