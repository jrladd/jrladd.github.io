Wherever there are real Christians on both sides, in any Controversie, (as we make no question but there are in this) it is most certain, the things wherein they are a­greed, are greater, far greater, than any wherein they can differ. When all the great substantials of Christianity are out of doubt, both with you and us, that which shall af­terwards remain as a disagreed, or doub<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ed thing on ei­ther side, must needs be Comparatively very small, and not worthy of the Heat and Zeal too commonly laid out upon it.</p><p>And we must profess for our own parts, (tho wherein we differ from you, we are verily perswaded, the truth is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e350"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> on our side, yet reckoning it to be only truth of an infe­rior Nature) it has not been without regret, that we have been engag'd in this Contention. The <span class="hi">Disputation</span> it self was not what we sought, or was forward to; it was not we that gave the Challenge: Nor when given, would we have accepted it, had it not been so circumstanc'd, as that our refusal wou'd most probably have redounded to the detriment and dishonour of what we believe to be the Truth: Many, especially the more injudicious part of the Auditory, before whom the Challenge was given, not be­ing likely to judge otherwise, than that what we main­tain wou'd not bear a publick hearing, shou'd we have declin'd a <span class="hi">Disputation,</span> which we were so publickly pro­vok'd to.</p><p>And for this <span class="hi">Publication</span> of it, 'tis what we are alike passive in: The World shou'd have had no after-trouble about that <span class="hi">Disputation,</span> might we have been the choosers: But since your Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> has abus'd the World with a most false and unfair Account of that matter; we are ne­cessitated in our own defence, as well as that of the Truth, to Publish the ensuing Papers. We wou'd not therefore, that either what was said by us at the <span class="hi">Disputa­tion,</span> or is further added in these our <span class="hi">Reflections</span> shou'd be misunderstood by you: This is not work that we take pleasure in, but what we have been constrain'd to: And if any Reflections shou'd occur that may seem too severe; we wou'd here declare, they proceed not from displea­sure against the whole Body of those whose sentiments agree with yours, nor against any one barely for that reason: But we cou'd not but manifest a just indignation against the Egregious falsehood and uncharitableness of him that publish'd the late (pretended) <span class="hi">Narrative</span>: And we desire, that no one of the Pious and Sober amongst you, wou'd apply to your selves, what was only intend­ed as a Rebuke to him, or those who are too like him. Nor will the rest of you (we hope) take it ill from us, that we expose, as it deserves, that which is so base, tho' it be found with a Person that pretends, in the present Controversie, to fall in with you. You will not, you cannot once imagine, that his Concurrence with you in this Point of Baptism, will hallow or excuse all that <span class="hi">de­ceit</span> and <span class="hi">falsehood</span> that appears in him: Nor can you your <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e405"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> selves like it, that he shou'd endeavour to support your cause with lies.</p><p>This being premis'd, we are in hopes, the following Papers, if they shou'd do no <span class="hi">good</span> amongst you, may at least be look'd into without doing <span class="hi">hurt.</span> So far as they re­port <span class="hi">matters of fact,</span> we can boldly, and without fear of being put to shame, appeal to the <span class="hi">All-knowing-God,</span> and to the Numerous <span class="hi">Assembly,</span> who were Witnesses, that they are undisguised <span class="hi">Truths:</span> And so far as they contain <span class="hi">Matters of Opinion</span> on one side or other, we leave you and all others to judge for themselves.</p><p>Yet (as we have already intimated) we wou'd not that the matters contended about in these Papers, shou'd be over-magnified on either side: Or that it shou'd be sup­pos'd we differ further than we do: And 'tis a much grea­ter pleasure to us, to offer any thing that may tend to <span class="hi">narrow</span> and <span class="hi">lessen,</span> than to <span class="hi">Enhance</span> the differences there are betwixt you and us. After we had been tir'd with an unpleasing contention, we therefore (as a refreshment to our selves) undertook this more delightful service; here to attempt, so far as may be, (notwithstanding little dif­ferences) to reconcile, and bring nearer to each other the Pious and Sober on both sides. To which end we shall, <span class="hi">first,</span> mention to you how far, and wherein we appre­hend we are agreed: And thence manifest in the <span class="hi">second</span> place, how inconsiderable the things are, about which we differ.</p><p>I. We are agreed, (without doubt) in every thing that is of absolute necessity to salvation: This is as certain as that there are <span class="hi">Christians</span> (that are truly such) on both sides; that there are those <span class="hi">that shall be sav'd</span> on both sides: Nothing that does <span class="hi">Essentially</span> constitute <span class="hi">Christianity</span> is controverted betwixt us: And even with reference to this very point of <span class="hi">Baptism,</span> we are verily perswaded, there is a nearer agreement betwixt the truly Pious and Serious on both sides, than is commonly consider'd. Particularly,</p><ul><li class="item">(1.) It is, it must needs be agreed by all such, that there is no possibility of salvation, for any Soul in our A­postate World, but only in and thro' Christ, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 4.12.</li><li class="item">(2.) 'Tis also agreed, that the Covenant of Grace does fix the terms, upon which Christ will be a Saviour to any: That thence only it is to be known, whom he will save, and whom he will not be a Saviour to.</li><li class="item"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e488"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span>(3.) 'Tis also undeniably plain, and what cannot but be agreed amongst us, that according to the Constitution of that Covenant Christ will be the Saviour of none, but such as are <span class="hi">sincerely devoted</span> to God: He never was, nor will he ever be the Saviour of any others; but such he has alw<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ys b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>en a Saviour to, <span class="hi">Ier.</span> 31.33. <span class="hi">Psal.</span> 119.38. <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 7.25. Upon these Principles it is, that every serious Soul does devote it self to God in hope. And we doubt not, but you are also agreed with us.</li><li class="item">(4.) That such who are Sollicitous about their own salvation, cannot be unconcern'd about the State of their <span class="hi">Infants.</span> Every Pious Parent will (under the apprehension of that Guilt and Corruption which they inherit with their Nature) with enlarged Affections yearn over their tender little ones, and earnestly cry to God for 'em, and gladly lay hold upon <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>y word of hope concerning 'em. Those amongst you who are Parents, feel and know what is the heart of a Parent towards its Child: And however you are (as all that are truly Christians are) un­f<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ignedly concern'd for, and desirous to promote the <span class="hi">common salvation</span>; yet for your <span class="hi">Infants,</span> that are so near you, that are (as it were) parts of your selves, you feel yet another kind of con<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ern: You cannot with any sa­tisfaction die from 'em; you can't, when they are dying, part with 'em, unless <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ou hav<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> some ground of hope con­cerning 'em▪ Nor can any thing afford you Encourage­ment to hope; without som<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> word of Promise. Nor is there any word of Promise, only to such as are devoted to God and i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Coven<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nt wi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>h him, in and thro' Christ: To be <span class="hi">with<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ut Christ, without hope, and without God in the W<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rld,</span> is represented as the Case of such as are <span class="hi">out of Co­venant</span> with him, strangers to his Covenant, <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 2.12.

Now here is the internal and most excellent part of <span class="hi">Baptism,</span> in which we are agreed.—After which, 'tis somewhat to be wonder'd at, that there shou'd be any remaining difference, as to this matter: However, that which can after such Agreements remain a Controversie, must needs be concluded to be of an inferior and less concerning Nature. Which we now therefore come to speak to.</li></ul><p>II. The things in which we differ (from what has been already said) appear to be no fundamental ones: Which will also yet farther be manifested, if the things them­selves be particularly consider'd. That which is the Sub­ject of the ensuing Papers, and which is commonly agi­tated betwixt you and us, may be reduc'd to these two heads, <span class="hi">viz.</span> (1.) Whether we may, and ought to <span class="hi">devote our Infants to God in the Ordinance of Baptism?</span> And, (2.) Whether in the Administration of it, we be oblig'd to <span class="hi">dip the Person wholly under Water?</span> As to both which, it must be own'd, we are yet disagreed: You judging the Ordinance of Baptism, which we apply to <span class="hi">Infants,</span> not to belong to 'em: And while we apprehend <span class="hi">sprinkling</span> it self, especially <span class="hi">pouring</span> a little <span class="hi">water</span> upon the Face of a Per­son, or <span class="hi">dipping his Face alone in water,</span> to be Lawful in the Administration of this Ordinance; you suppose we are ob<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ig'd to <span class="hi">dip,</span> or plunge the Person <span class="hi">wholly</span> into wa­ter. And while there is a difference in our apprehensi­ons, it must also be concluded, that on one side or the o­ther, there is cert<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>inly a mistake: <span class="hi">But</span> tho' there be a mistake, suppose it to be on your side, or on our's, 'tis far from being a damning one.</p><ul><li class="item">1. We will first (as we think we have just reason) sup­pose the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>istake to be with you; yet we dare not, nor do A<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>count it a fatal, or undoing one. Those of your way, that agree with us as above (and all the Pious and Sober p<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rt <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>f you, we take it, for granted, do) do only differ from us in a Circumstance. You agree with us, that your <span class="hi">Infants</span> are to be enter'd into Covenant with God in Christ, and seriously devoted to him, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> You on­ly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e783"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> doubt, whether it may be done in <span class="hi">this Ordinance</span>: Now tho we are perswaded, that they shou'd not only be en­ter'd into Covenant, but also that this solemnity of <span class="hi">Bap­tism</span> shou'd Accompany, and add force to the surrender we make of 'em to God: Yet we do not Account it so absolutely necessary, as if the salvation either of the Pa­rent or Child were suspended on it. We read indeed that <span class="hi">Baptism saves us,</span> 1 Pet. 3.21. But the Apostle to pre­vent mistake, immediately explains himself, and tells us, he does not intend it of the External Ceremony, but of the <span class="hi">Answer of a good Conscience:</span> Our unfeigned consent to the <span class="hi">Baptismal Covenant</span> for our selves and for those that we have Power to consent, and accept it for; and our sincere devoting our selves and them in that Covenant to God in Christ, is indeed necessary to theirs, and to our own salvation; and this is that <span class="hi">Answer of a good Consci­ence,</span> which the Apostle calls for: But where this is found, tho' the External Ceremony shou'd be omitted (whether thro' the mistake of the Parent, or thro' the absence of a Minister) we don't think God will, nor are we any of those who dare, pass a sentence of Death in such a Case. <p>And for the point of <span class="hi">dipping,</span> we reckon it to be yet much less material: The <span class="hi">necessity of it</span> we do indeed op­pose; and doubt not but the Ordinance of <span class="hi">Baptism</span> (so far as concerns this Controversie) is Lawfully Administer'd, if water be apply'd to a Person, in <span class="hi">any other way</span> or man­ner; so it be done with the awful and solemn mention of the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: But yet, supposing it be so order'd, that the <span class="hi">Life</span> of the Person be not hazarded by it; nor any breach made upon the Rules of modesty, we do not Condemn the Practice of <span class="hi">Dipping</span>: And in those two Cases, all that are truly Pious amongst your selves, must (upon deliberation) needs dis­allow it, as well as we.</p></li><li class="item">2. And now we will suppose the mistake to be on our part: We make no difficulty of it, to own that we are fal­lible: As wise and good Men as we are, nay, far wiser and better than we, have been mistaken; and 'tis no wonder if in many things we be so; Nay, we doubt not, but in some things at least, we are so, because we are Men: Tho' we do not know, that in any Principle of Religion we are so, for that we dare not knowingly Err: Wherein so­ever <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e849"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> we are convinc'd of a mistake, we do, and we are willing to retract it: But we may be in an errour, and may not know it: And we will for a while <span class="hi">suppose</span> (tho' we have never yet seen rea­son to <span class="hi">grant</span>) that, as to the matters in difference betwixt you and us, we are under a mistake: Yet neither can the mistake on our side endanger the Foundations, supposing we shou'd be mi­staken. For,</li></ul><p>As to the Point of <span class="hi">Infant-Baptism,</span> if it shou'd prove to be a mistake, 'tis only a <span class="hi">Circumstantial</span> one, a mistake as to the <span class="hi">time</span> of Administration: This is the worst that can be made of it, if we shou'd be mistaken: And where is the damage, supposing we shou'd be <span class="hi">too early</span> laid under the most-solemn Bonds to be the Lords? Tho' by the way, we see not how <span class="hi">this</span> can be done <span class="hi">too soon.</span> We do not, we dare not rest upon our having been bap­tiz'd in Infancy, as if that wou'd of it self save us: We do indeed reckon it to be <span class="hi">Valid Baptism,</span> and that we do not need to be <span class="hi">Bap­tiz'd again,</span> when we become Adult; but we don't think our <span class="hi">In­fant-Baptism</span> will stand instead of <span class="hi">Regeneration,</span> or exempt us from the necessity of Faith, Repentance, or a life of serious Holiness, when we are Adult; Nay, we look upon our selves (by Vertue of that Baptism) to lie under unalterable Bonds and Obligations hereunto. And now, tho' it shou'd be suppos'd, we are under a mistake, as to the <span class="hi">time,</span> when this Ordinance shou'd be Admini­stred; yet can it have no hurtful influence upon us, or upon any of those great, and important Principles of Christianity in which we are agreed.</p><p>Or again, if you suppose us also mistaken as to the <span class="hi">manner of application,</span> while we do not (as you) <span class="hi">dip,</span> or plunge the Person baptiz'd wholly under water, but only apply a small quantity of water to 'em, most commonly by <span class="hi">Pouring</span> it upon their Faces: Yet neither can this surely, (if a mistake) be by you Accounted a very dangerous one: No part of serious Religion can be thought to be endanger'd by it. The Kingdom of Christ does not consist in <span class="hi">Dipping</span>; so as that he that is <span class="hi">Dipp'd</span> shall be sav'd, and he that is <span class="hi">not Dipp'd</span> shall be Damn'd: You your selves dare not lay so great a stress upon it. What! Shall a Soul that is truly Penitent, and with serious Actings of Faith and Love, gives up it self to God in Christ, a Soul that resolvedly lies at his Foot, that will not wickedly depart from him; Can you think such a Soul shall yet be rejected by him, meerly because in their Bap­tism they were not <span class="hi">Dipp'd</span> under water! This is what upon seri­ous deliberation, we are perswaded, none of you dare avow.</p><p>III. Now then, since it appears, that the matters in contest betwixt you and us (at least amongst the Pious and Sober on <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e937"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> both sides) are so inconsiderable and comparatively small; we wou'd make it the matter of our earnest request to you, that they may accordingly be own'd and look'd upon by you, do not enhance or over-rate the Value of 'em: By this means, a happy <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>utual agreement might most probably be effected, however all the ill effects of our remaining disagreements wou'd be prevent­ed or rem<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>v'd. (1.) No way more likely than this to promote an <span class="hi">Agreement</span> amongst us: Apprehensions that the differences are greater, and the mistakes more dangerous than they are, do naturally influence both si<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e to <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ook with strangenest upon each other, and prejudice 'em against what is, or may be offer'd on ei­ther side: But were it rightly consi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er'd, how little the difference is, it wou'd yet tend to <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ake it less; by softening minds on each side, and preparing 'em with greater impartiality to entertain whatever convincing evidence is laid before 'em. Or, (2.) If it wou'd not remove our differences themselves, it wou'd (at least) prevent all the ill effects of 'em: For instance, why might we not love, and live like Christians (notwithstanding the remain­ing differences in our Opinions)? Wh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> might we not pray with, and for each other? Wh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> might we not, according to the Rule of the Gospel, look favourably upon each others mistakes, and receive each other to <span class="hi">Love</span> and <span class="hi">Communion,</span> avoiding doubtful disputations, <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 14. throughout the Chapter. We solemnly declare, we are ready thus to receive you; we dare not but re­ceive all whom we are perswaded, our Lord himself will re­ceive: Let there not be a breach maintain'd on your Part, while we impose no sinful, or so much as suspected Term of Commu­nion on you. Or, supposing upon one or other mistake, you shou'd think fit to separate your selves from us, from our Assem­blies, yet, at least, we beg, you wou'd in your distinct Assem­blies see to it, that the great and uncontroverted Principles of Christianity may be ordinarily, and with greatest warmth and earnestness insisted on; and let not your Heat and Zeal be laid out upon the little things in which we differ: Let your endea­vours be rather to make Men <span class="hi">Christians,</span> than to make 'em <span class="hi">Anti­paedobaptists</span>; and shew that you prefer the interests of our com­mon Lord, before those of your particular Party.

Who had much rather spend my time in healing differences, and provoking all Christians to love one another. I have often read with some pleasing satisfaction, those Expressions of Arch-Bishop <span class="hi">Til­lotson,</span> (that Great Good Man, and National loss.) <span class="hi">I know not (says he) whether St.</span> Paul,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note5"><span class="hi">Tillotson,</span> Pres. to six Ser. on family Religi­on, <span class="hi">pag.</span> 3.</span> <span class="hi">who had been taken up into the third Heavens, did by that Question of his</span>; Where is the Disputer of this World? <span class="hi">Intend to insinuate that this wrangling work hath place only in this World, and upon this Earth, where on­ly there is a dust to be raised; but will have no place in the other. But whether St.</span> Paul <span class="hi">intended this or not, the thing it self I think is true, that in the other World all things will be clear and past dispute; to be sure a­mong the Blessed, and probably also among the miserable, unless fierce and furious Contentions, with great heat, without light, about things of no mo­ment and concernment to them, should be design'd for a part of their torment.</span> I had much rather be dressing my own Soul for Eternity, and preparing others for those calm and peaceable Regions, where perfect Charity and Good will Reign for ever: Than in fomenting and increas­ing those Divisions among Christians, which are too un­measurably wide already.</p><p>My Charity is not confin'd to any particular Sect, or Par­ty of Christians; but I bear a hearty good will to all that agree in the Essentials of Religion, Notwithstanding their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1092"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> distant Opinions, in matters of an inferior Nature. A re­form'd Catholick Christian, is a Name that pleaseth me better, than any of those distinguishing Titles which the Contentions of Men have occasion'd in the Christian Church. Tho' I was urg'd by many serious Christians, before the dis­putation, to Print my Sermons on this subject, which were manag'd rather in a Practical than Controversal way; Yet so averse was I to foment or Increase differences, that I wil­lingly forbore. And if Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> had only Printed the Imperfect Notes of his own <span class="hi">Scribes,</span> perhaps we should still have been silent; and left the World to judge between us: but seeing he hath been guilty of so many Notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations, both on his side and ours, we are unavoidably constrain'd to Vindicate the Truths of Christ, the common cause of the reformed Churches, and our own Reputation, against the bold insolence of a Scanda­lous Libeller:</p><p>The true occasion of my being engag'd in this matter is this: I was invited some years ago, before any <span class="hi">Anabaptist</span> Meeting was set up at <span class="hi">Gosport,</span> to Preach a Lecture once a fortnight at <span class="hi">Portsmouth</span>; which I have continu'd (I bless God with no small success) ever since. In the course of my Lecture, I thought it most adviseable to give my hearers a true and orderly Scheme of the Christian Religion. Hav­ing therefore explain'd the Creed and Lords Prayer (Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> undertaking the Ten Commandments) I did with­out any importunity from others, but purely in the method I had laid down, explain the Doctrine of the Sacraments: Here I largely explain'd the Nature of Baptism, and could not do right to my subject, without defending our own practice as to Infants right, and the way of Administration. Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> himself knows how falsely he hath Publish'd to the World, that I inveigh'd against the Poor <span class="hi">Baptists</span> (as he calls them) with most severe Reflections: Seeing he hath read those Notes which Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span> took of my Sermons. The very hardest expression in those Notes, is the Title of mistaken Brethren. These Sermons Mr. <span class="hi">Samuel Ring,</span> who, tho' of that perswasion, usually attends our Lecture, pen'd down in short hand, and afterwards wrote out at length; with an Innocent design (as he himself professeth) to shew them to some of his Brethren. <span class="hi">Farmer Bows,</span> a pre­tended <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1146"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> Messenger of the Churches, hearing of this, appli<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s himself to Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span> for a sight of these Sermons, and having read them, us'd words to this effect. Shall we bear this? If we suffer Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> thus to go on, it will prejudice our cause. Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span> reply'd, Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> takes but the same liberty in his own Congregation, to de­fend his own practice, that we do in ours.</p><p>But this was not satisfactory. Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> goes over to <span class="hi">Gosport,</span> to Mr. <span class="hi">John Webber,</span> Pastor of a Congregation of particular <span class="hi">Anabaptists,</span> as they are call'd, opposite in their Iudgments, in many great points of Religion, to those in <span class="hi">Portsmouth.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> (as he told me himself) was willing to live in Peace, and did not desire to be engag'd: But Mr. <span class="hi">Leddel,</span> and some others, Men of heat without light, were very urgent, and willing even to accept of <span class="hi">Matthew Caffen</span> for their Champion, whom Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> propos'd: A Man that denies both the Divinity and Huma­nity of Christ, and is justly protested against, by many of his Brethren, and particularly by Dr. <span class="hi">Russel.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> justly refus'd to own <span class="hi">Matthew Caffen,</span> as a Christian, or a Brother. And therefore, since they would have a dispute, rather propos'd Dr. <span class="hi">Russel.</span> Accordingly, <span class="hi">December</span> 21▪98. Mr. <span class="hi">Bows,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Webber,</span> and about twenty of their Party came to my Lecture boldly to confront me, when I was Answering the <span class="hi">Anabaptists</span> Objections. At the Conclu­sion, <span class="hi">Farmer Bows</span> stands up, and in the Name of the rest Challenges me with Preaching Doctrines false and wholly untrue, and desir'd I would admit of a publick dispute with an ordain'd Minister of the Gospel: This bold Challenge I accepted, provided they would procure a Man that under­stood the regular Laws of disputation, and preliminaries were first settled. Accordingly the next Day, Prelimina­ries were settled and Papers interchang'd, between <span class="hi">Thomas Bows</span> and <span class="hi">William Leddel,</span> as asserters of the two Que­stions on the one part: And <span class="hi">Francis Williams,</span> and <span class="hi">Samuel Chandler,</span> as deniers of the two Questions on the other Part. This Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> perfectly conceals, in his Account of the Preliminaries, <span class="hi">pag.</span> 4. Because it would have confuted his slander upon the Learned Dr. <span class="hi">Smith,</span> as if he design'd, by saying, he that asserts must prove, that the Proof lay upon us; but this is Accounted for elsewhere. Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> after­wards <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1267"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> declares his utter dislike of the dispute, and wish'd i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> had never been: And before my self and Mr. <span class="hi">Smith,</span> deny'd that the Letter in the Name of the Church at <span class="hi">Gosport, Narr. p.</span> 2. was wrote with his Knowledg or consent. There­fore we Impute not the Falshood of the matter, as if Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> had inveigh'd against and ridicul'd their Practice; nor the false Grammar in that Letter to him. Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span> express'd his hearty sorrow by Letter (as well as otherwise) in these following words — (after having sent me the notes of my Sermons, and delivered a Copy of the Disputation to Mr. <span class="hi">Smith.</span>) — I am troubled at the Sad Effects of the Disputation. I mean the difference it hath rais'd among those, that I hope are all the People of God: And the Grief it may have occasion'd to any of his faithfull Ministers: And most of all that I have contributed any thing towards it: Tho' it hath been by accident and no otherwise: and as I pray God forgive me, so I beg your pardon, and crave a share in your Prayers. I always respected you, as a Minister of Christ Iesus; have pray'd for the Success of your Ministry, and have heard you with a great deal of Satisfaction, and I hope have profited by it; and shall continue to do so, and so at­tend your Ministry without the le<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>st P<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ejudice, and I hope with better Success than formerly. I am, <span class="hi">Sir,</span> yours in all Christian Service. <span class="hi">Samuel Ring. Portsmouth, May</span> 29.99.</p><p>This is the true Copy of Mr. <span class="hi">Ring's</span> Letter to me, who according to his promise usually attends our Lecture at <span class="hi">Portsmouth,</span> Now let the World Iudg whether my Preju­dice against the growth of the Church at <span class="hi">Gosport,</span> could put me upon this work; or whether I ever inveigh'd against them; many of them can testify to the contrary, to whom <span class="hi">I</span> have, and shall bear an hearty love and good will; own them as excel­lent Servants of Christ, and be very willing to contribute my Assistance, to help them forward in their way to Heaven. But alas! 'Tis Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> and his party that are afraid of the growth of Mr. <span class="hi">Webbers</span> Congregation: And therefore did suspend from their Communion, one <span class="hi">Isaac Harman</span> by Name, a Ioyner in <span class="hi">Portsmouth,</span> for bearing Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span>: this the Young Man told me himself, and ask'd my advice about it; and Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> told me himself before Mr. <span class="hi">Francis Willi­ams,</span> that if he could Believe that our Doctrine of Original <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1351"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> Sin, he should think Infants had need of Baptism: And won­der'd the People of <span class="hi">Gosport</span> should Scruple the Practice of Infant Baptism, and yet maintain the Doctrine of Original Sin. This Man it seems wants not express Command or Example, but only to be feelingly acquainted with the uni­versal Corruption of Humane Nature; and then would rea­dily Embrace our Practice. I Pray God open his Eyes, and convince him of this great truth, which is of far greater weight than this of Baptism.</p></div><div class="abridged_sermons" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1364"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=10">[Page 2]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">AN ABRIDGMENT OF THOSE SERMONS THAT WERE The Innocent Occasion of the Disputation.</span></h2><p>HEre I must unavoidably dip my Pen in the Wa­try Controversy: I love not to meddle with matters of Dispute, especially where Sober and Good Men are at Odds: But I cannot do right to my Subject, without mentioning the Grounds of our Practice, both as to the Subjects of Baptism, and the manner of its Administration.

I shall prove from Scripture, <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>arrantableness of Infant Baptism, or of the Baptizing the Infants of Believing Parents. Here I shall not burden you with ma­ny Scriptures, that might be produced: but only mention some few that I think most clear.</p><p>First From <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 28.19. <span class="hi">Go, Disciple all Nations Baptizing them.</span> From hence I thus argue.</p><p>1. The Infants of Believing Parents are Disciples, and therefore ought to be Baptiz'd. Now we have a plain Text that these Infants are Disciples, in <span class="hi">Act<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> 15.19. <span class="hi">Why tempt ye God to put a Yoke upon the Necks of the Disciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</span> This Yoke was that of Circumcision, a ve­ry painful ordinance. Administred to Infants of 8 days old; this Yoke these false Teachers would impose not on­ly on the Gentile Christians but their Infants too, and there­fore St. <span class="hi">Paul</span> was acus'd by them, that he taught, they should not Circumcise their Children nor Keep the Customs of <span class="hi">Moses, Acts</span> 21.21. Now when our Saviour says <span class="hi">Go, Disciple all Nations</span>: The Apostles must need understand, that such as were Disciples in the Jewish State, should be admitted to this ordinance in the Chri­stian Church.</p><p>2. Infants are a considerable part of a Nation, and therefore we cannot suppose, they should be excluded, except they were excluded by Name or good Conse­quence.</p><p>3. All Nations, is here put in opposition to the one Nation of the Jews. As if our Saviour had said, where­as the Jews have hitherto been the peculiar People of God, and admitted to peculiar Priviledges, now I admit all Nations to the same Priviledges, the Jews only enjoy'd before; <span class="hi">Eph.</span> 2.12, 13. Now it was a great Privi­ledg among the Jews, that their Infants were dedicated and devoted to God, and admitted into his Church, and Covenant, in their early years; therefore the Apostles must needs understand, when our Saviour said, all Nati­ons should be Discipled, that the Gentiles, and their Children should be admitted to the same Priviledges the Jews enjoy'd before.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1448"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=11">[Page 4]</a></span>4. Our Saviour must needs intend Infants unless he had excluded them. If he would not be any longer a God in Covenant with them, he would have raz'd out their Names. Suppose the words had run thus: <span class="hi">Go, Disciple all Nations, Circumcising them</span>; the Apostles must have understood that their Infants were intended, and why not the same, when only the rite is alter'd? Or suppose it had run, <span class="hi">Go, Disciple the Iews, Baptizing them</span>; They must needs admit Infants that were ad­mitted before. So that whereas our mistaken Brethren call for an express Scripture for Infant Baptism, we have reason to answer, there needs express Scripture to revoke that Priviledg and Covenant Interest which Infants in­joy'd before. If it had been Christs intention to have excluded Infants from the Church, there must have been a positive Law, where such an intention of Christ should have been express'd: for nothing can make that unlawful, which was a Duty before, but a direct and 'express prohibition from the <span class="hi">Legis­lator</span> himself; <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note6"><span class="hi">Stilling-Fleet Iren.</span> pag. 7.</span> who alone hath Po­wer to Rescind, as well as make Laws. You know there was a great Controversy, whe­ther Circumcision should continue or not, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 21.21: and certainly there would have been a far greater, if, upon their coming to Christ, their Infants had been excluded the Church, and ranked with Heathens; but seeing we find no Objections made about this matter, nor that our Saviour ever revok'd this Priviledg, we may be assur'd they still enjoy it.</p><p>5. The Practice of Baptizing Infants was customary among the <span class="hi">Iews</span>; those that have but dip'd their fingers in the <span class="hi">Iewish</span> Writings know, that not only <span class="hi">Proselytes</span> (as Mr. <span class="hi">Tombs</span> acknowledgeth) but Native <span class="hi">Iews</span> them­selves, were admitted into the Church by Circumcision, as an initiating ordinance; by Baptism, as a purifying Cere­mony, to wash them from Legal Uncleanness, which they might ignorantly contract; and by Sacrifice to ex­piate their Sin; and that this was not a Corrupt Traditi­on, but grounded on those many Texts, that require washing from uncleanness: And therefore this Practice is grounded on, <span class="hi">Gen.</span> 35.2. <span class="hi">Exod.</span> 19.10. by the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1512"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=11">[Page 5]</a></span> <span class="hi">Gemera Talmud,</span> and <span class="hi">Maimonides.</span> Now therefore seeing Infants were thus admitted by Baptism, and our Saviour was pleas'd to adopt this custom into a Christian Sacra­ment, we have reason to believe that Infants are admit­ted now as before.</p><p>2. Another Scripture is in <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2.38, 39. <span class="hi">Repent and be Baptized, for the promise is to you and to your Children; and to those afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span> The Apostle <span class="hi">Peter</span> doth in this place perswade those he had convinc'd, of the greatness of their Sin, in murdering the Lord of Glory, penitently to return to God, and then Incoura­ges them to hope, they should again be receiv'd into Favour with God: And, says he, the promise will be made good, not only to you but to your Children too: And to the Gentile World also, Even to as many as the Lord our God shall call. Thence I argue.</p><p>1. This promise, was the great promise to <span class="hi">Abraham.</span> Some pretend it is only that promise in <span class="hi">Ioel</span> 2.8. Gods giving extraordinary gifts of the Spirit; That their Sons and Daughters should Prophecy. But this cannot be, because that promise was not fullfill'd to all afar off. Have all the Gifts of Tongues? Do all Prophecy? The promise signifys the great promise <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> to <span class="hi">Abraham, I will be a God to thee and to thy seed, Gen.</span> 17.17. Therefore this is call'd the promise <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 3.14. <span class="hi">That the blessing' of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles, thro' Iesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, thro' Faith.</span> The Blessing of <span class="hi">Abraham:</span> That great Blessing that God would be a God to him and his seed. Now if this great Blessing come to the Gentiles, Then they and their seed ought to receive the token of the Covenant; the Children of the promise ought to have the Seal affixed to it.</p><p>2. The Apostle useth these words to comfort the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> that had Imprecated Divine Vengeance on them­selves and their Children, Infants as well as others; a curse that lies on the unbelieving <span class="hi">Iews</span> to this day: <span class="hi">His blood be upon us and our Children</span>; no doubt, but many of those, that were prick'd at the heart at <span class="hi">Peters</span> Sermon, joyn'd with the rabble in that Loud cry; <span class="hi">Crucifie him, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1582"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=12">[Page 6]</a></span> Crucifie him,</span> and were concern'd not only for themselves but their Children too; therefore the Apostle uses this Argument, if you penitently return to God by faith in Christ, the curse shall be taken off from you and your Children, you and yours shall be admitted again, and not only so, but those that are afar off, the Gentile World, when call'd.</p><p>3. If the words were to be restrain'd, only to those that believe and repent themselves, and concern not their Infants; this would be an Argument to perswade the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> to continue in the Synagogue still, rather than to come into the Christian Church. While Synagogue worship stood before Christs coming, God had pro­mis'd happy Priviledges, to themselves and Children; but now if afterwards their Children must be cast off, and look'd on as no other than Heathens, and strangers to the Covenants of promise, this would incline them rather to continue in the Synagogue, than enter in­to the Christian Church.</p><p>A Third Scripture is in <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 11.15, 25. In those ver­ses, these following things are containd.</p><p>1. The Apostle speaks of breaking off from and gra­sfing into the Visible Church; that the Unbelieving <span class="hi">Iews</span> were broken off from that Visible Church, to which they were related before, by their positive unbelief, and rejecting Christ; and that the Gentile Believers were graff'd in, and so partook of those Priviledges, from which the Gentiles were broken off.</p><p>2. Some only were broken off, the rest that Believ'd, injoy'd the same Priviledges they did before, <span class="hi">v.</span> 17<span class="hi">th.</span> Now this was a great Priviledg, that God would be a God to them and to their seed: Therefore they still in­joy'd the same.</p><p>3. What Priviledges the <span class="hi">Iews</span> left, the whole body shall be restor'd to when the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in, <span class="hi">v.</span> 25. therefore their Infants shall be restor'd to the same Priviledges th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> injoy'd before.</p><p>4. The Believing Gentiles are admitted to the Privi­ledges the <span class="hi">Iews</span> injoy'd before, gra<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>fed into the same Olive-Tree, <span class="hi">v.</span> 24. S<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eing <span class="hi">Iewish</span> infants w<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>re interested in the Church and Covenant of God, the Inf<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ts of Be­lieving <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1662"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=12">[Page 7]</a></span> Gentiles are also in Covenant, and consequently ought to have Baptism, the Seal, applyed to them.</p><p>4. A Fourth Scripture is in 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 7.14. <span class="hi">Else were your Children unclean, but now are they holy.</span> Hence I argue, If the Children of Believers are holy, then this ordi­nance ought to be Administer'd to them. The only diffi­culty here, is to understand what is meant, by holiness in this place.</p><p>1. Internal Holiness cannot be ascrib'd to all the In­fants of believers. Because we find by sad experience, that many of them shamefully Apostatize from God, and thereby plainly shew, the Seed of Grace was never in them, 1 <span class="hi">Iohn</span> 3.9.</p><p>2. Neither can it be understood of bare Legitimacy, as our mistaken brethren pretend. For,</p><p>1. The Word is never us'd in this sense, in all the Scripture.</p><p>2. The Children of Heathens, if begotten in Lawful Wed­lock, are Legitimate, as well as of Believers; therefore this can be no distinguishing mark, as in this place.</p><p>3. The Apostle's Argument would be weak and un­concluding, if he should only prove that they were Lawful Man and Wife, because their Children were Lawfully begotten. The Question propos'd to the Apo­stle was this. Supposing a believing Wife Marry'd to an unbeliever, or <span class="hi">e contra,</span> whether the believer should dwell with the unbeliever, or part one from another. The Apostle Answers,</p><p><span class="hi">If the unbeliever be willing to abide, let them do so, For the unbelieving Wife is sanctified by the Husband, and else were <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>our Children unclean, but now are they Holy.</span> Because one Parent is a believer, therefore their Children are peculiarly related to God, and in Covenant with him.</p><p>Now if bare Legitimacy were intended, then the Ar­gument would run thus: You have no Reason to questi­on, whether you are Man and Wife, because your Chil­dren are Lawfully begotten. Can any believe any could question the one, and yet grant the other?</p><p>4. This would not answer the <span class="hi">Corinthians</span> Scruple: They did not question, whether co-habiting with Unbe­lievers, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1725"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=13">[Page 8]</a></span> expos'd them to Fornication; but, whether it would expose them to Irreligion, or at least, great Tem­ptations. Now, says the Apostle, <span class="hi">How Knowest thou, O Man, but thou may'st save thy Wife?</span> However, your Children are holy, because one is a believer.</p><p>3. By holiness is meant Relative or Federal Holiness. That the Children of Believers are Separated to God, enter'd into a new Relation to him, by vertue of his Covenant. Thus the <span class="hi">Israelites</span> are said to be a holy Peo­ple, because Separated to God as his peculiar Treasure, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> 14.2.26.19. the Infants of Believing Parents are thus holy, as related to God and enjoying distinguishing marks of Favour, therefore ought to have this distinguish­ing ordinance apply'd to them?</p><p>2. What Priviledges are the Infants of Believers In­vested in by Baptism?</p><p>1. They are solemnly admitted into the Visible Church; no longer strangers to the Covenants of Promise, but more nearly related to God, than the Infants of Hea­thens.</p><p>2. Peculiarly interested in the Churches Prayers; we are bound indeed to pray for all Men, but more peculi­arly for the Church of God, <span class="hi">Gal:</span> 6.16.</p><p>3. Have a Title to Gods peculiar care. God gives his Angels a charge over them, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 18.10.</p><p>4. They stand nearer to, and are the more especial Objects of the promises of Grace, <span class="hi">Is.</span> 44.3.59. In­fants are call'd by Gods Name, therefore tho' Gods Grace is free, yet we have more Reason to hope, the promises will be made good to them than others. The vein of Election frequently runs in the Channel of Believing Parents, and their seed.</p><p>5. They are put into a new Covenant Relation. As <span class="hi">Abraham</span> receiv'd the sign of Circumcision, as a Seal of the Righteousness of Faith, to himself and seed, <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 4.11. So this ordinance of Baptism, shall be a Seal of the Righ­teousness of Faith, to Believers and their seed.</p><p>6. If they dye during their Infant State, they shall be saved. Our Saviour useth this Argument for the proof of the Resurrection. <span class="hi">I am the God of Abraham, Mat.</span> 22.32. Now for God to be the God of any, is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1787"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=13">[Page 9]</a></span> to distinguish them from others by his rewards; he did not do thus for <span class="hi">Abraham,</span> and his Family, in this World, therefore there is another, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 11.16. Now when God is said to be a God to Believers and their seed, the mean­ing is, he will be a rewarder of them; therefore if they dy in their Infant State, they have a promise to rely on, that God will receive them to Salvation. Whereas others must leave their Children to the unfathomable depths of Divine Mercy, as they do the Heathen World.</p><p>3. The Practical uses of Infant Baptism beyond that of Years. This I do the rather, to take off the Common Objection, that Infant Baptism is an useless Ordi­nance.</p><p>1. By Baptizing our Infants we practically own our Original Pollution. Those Baptiz'd at R<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>per Years own themselves Sinners by Practice; but do not necessarily own, that there is a Fountain of Sin within: But when we offer our Children to be Baptiz'd, we acknowledg that we have been Instruments of conveying polluted Natures to our Infants; and that they need washing by the Blood and Spirit of Christ. Thus the Prophet sets forth our sinful State, by the Pollutions of a new born In­fant, <span class="hi">Ezek.</span> 16.4.</p><p>2. Hereby we practically acknowledg the Necessity of Gods free Grace in order to our recovery. As an Infant cannot contribute to his Baptism, but is purely passive; So we can contribute nothing, by any Work or Merit of our own, towards obtaining the Grace of God, and Regenerating Influences of his Spirit. <span class="hi">It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that shew­eth Mercy, Rom.</span> 9.16.</p><p>3. Hereby we practically own Christs universal Head­ship, that he is Lord of all, of all Ages, Sexes, and Conditions. Those that deny their Children, to be in Covenant with God, hereby deny them to be Visible Members of Christ; And thus rob him of a great part of his Subjects, and indeed rob themselves of that com­fort they might enjoy: they look upon their Infants, as in the same case and State, with the Heathen World. If Christ save them, it is by a Prerogative of Mercy, and not as his Members or Covenant Children; but <span class="hi">for this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1827"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=14">[Page 10]</a></span> cause Christ both Died, <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>d Rose, and reviv'd, that he might be the Lord, of the Dead and Living. Rom.</span> 14.9. and as Christ whilst an Infant himself, was head of the Church, so he is pleas'd to admit of Infant Members, in Covenant with him.</p><p>4. Infant Baptism lays stronger Obligations on Parents, to train up their Children for God. Certainly tis a mighty Obligation on a Parent to consider. 1. I have <span class="margQuotes">Solemnly devoted my Child to God. Solemnly promis'd, before the Minister, and in the Face of a great Congrega­tion, that I will Endeavour by hearty Prayers, Serious Instructions, and a Religious Example, to train up my Child for God; the vows of the Lord are upon me, and I shall add perjury to the rest of my Sins, if I Neg­lect them.</span> The Prophet makes it, a great Agravati­on of the <span class="hi">Israelites</span> Sin, that they had taken their Sons and Daughters that they had Born unto God, and Sacra­fic'd them to Idols. <span class="hi">Ezek.</span> 16.21. and it follows, <span class="hi">Thou hast slain my Children.</span> God calls them his Children, as born in his Family, and Solemnly devoted to him. So the sin of Christians will be highly aggravated, if they bring up their Children for the destroyer, and Neglect those Parental Instructions, they have oblig'd themselves to.</p><p>5. Infant Baptism Engages Children to acquaint them­selves, with the Terms and Tenour of the Covenant. When Children are told by their Parents, how Solemnly they were enter'd into Covenant with God, this engages them to enquire betimes, what they are by Nature, what they may be by Grace, and to understand all the Principles of Religion, in order to that end.</p><p>6. Infant Baptism Engages us against Sin Betimes. We are prepossess'd with a happy Prejudice against Sin, in our Early Years; and this is a great advantage. <span class="hi">When Hannibal was but 9 years Old, his Father made him la<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> his hand upon the Altar, and Swear, that he would be an Irreconcilable Enemy to the Romans</span>: And this was the Reason he would never admit of any Peace with them. My Friends, we were Engaged for God against Sin, and the Devil, as our Irreconcilable Enemies, not at 9 Years Old, but in our Infant State; and this obliges us to maintain a constant Enmity against them for ever.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1873"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=14">[Page 11]</a></span>7. Infant Baptism is a great Encouragement for Faith in Prayer, with Respect to our Children. Those that have dedicated their Children to God in Baptism, may pray to God, with larger Measures of Faith and Hope, than such as have Neglected this Duty. They may say, <span class="margQuotes">Lord I have resign'd them up unto thee; Brought them to thine Authoriz'd Representative to be listed into thy Family; consented for them, to the claims of thy Co­venant; and the token of thy Covenant, hath been ap­ply'd to them; let the Promises of thy Covenant be made good to them. They are call'd by thy Name, do thou receive them: They are Visible Members of thy Church. Oh give them the Favours that belong to thy Children.</span> A Visible Relation to God is a good Encou­ragement for Faith in Prayer. <span class="hi">We are call'd by thy Name: Thou bearest not Rule over them. Ier.</span> 14.9. Those that have not thus dedicated their Children to God, can only say, Lord be Merciful to them, tho' they are not call'd by thy Name, and make them thine. But we have a better Plea; and can say, Lord they are call'd by thy Name.</p><p>8. Infant Baptism adds to the Parents comfort. They may comfortably hope as to their living seed, that if they are Faithful in training them up for God, he will according to his promise, <span class="hi">Is.</span> 44.3. pour out his Spirit and Blessing upon them: and as to those that die in an Infant State, they have Reason to Believe and hope, that they are happy, because God hath promis'd to be a God to them, and to their seed: Whereas those that Neglect this ordi­nance have no more Reason to hope for the Salvation of their Infants, than the Heathens; must only leave them, to the unfathomable depths of Gods Goodness, having no promise to rely upon.</p><p>4. I shall answer some Principal Objections against this Truth.</p><p>1. There is no Precept nor Example for Infant Bap­tism, in all the New Testament; This is a Common Objection, and therefore deserves a distinct answer,</p><p>1. To this I Answer: What Express Command or Ex­ample can they produce for previous Examination of Per­sons that offer themselves to be Baptiz'd; for Stated <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1906"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=15">[Page 12]</a></span> Prayer, before and after this Ordinance; or for dipping or Plunging the whole Body under Water? All these things must be deduc'd by consequence; for no express Scripture can be produc'd for them. I may add, what ex­press Command have they for singing Psalms in Rhime and Metre, which is the Practice of the most Orthodox Anabaptists at this day? I mention this the rather, to convince Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> and his adherents, what a doughty Champion they have chosen for themselves. For this Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> hath written some Animadversions on his Brother <span class="hi">Allen</span>'s Essay, on singing Psalms; wherein he advances the very same Arguments, against their Practice of singing Psalms, that he doth against ours for Infant Baptism; and therefore hath prov'd himself a Hackny dis­putant, that hath one constant Road, and train of Argu­ments, upon all occasions. Perhaps I may be so dull of Ap­prehension, as not to be able to Answer them, therefore must cry, Men of <span class="hi">Israel</span> help. <span class="hi">The Arguments of</span> Russel <span class="hi">against Allen, pag.</span> 9.</p><div class="q"><p>If it doth not appear from Scripture, or any Authentic.

But to return from this digression.</p><p>2. Those Truths that were Establish'd in the Old Testament, are rather suppos'd than positively express'd in the New; but the Grounds and Foundations upon which Infant Baptism stands, were Establish'd in the Old Testament. Infants were then admitted into the Covenant and Church of God: Except therefore Christ had blotted their Names out of the Covenant, and Rolls of the Church; They are to be continued there, under the New Testament. Thus a Magistracy was setled under the Old Testament, but there is no precept for it under the New; the Lawfulness of War was then setled, but suppos'd, not expres<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> under the New. The forbid­den degrees of Marriage, were setled under the Old Testament: No need of mentioning them again under the New.</p><p>3. Ans. There are many Virtual and General Com­mands for the Baptizing of Infants in the New Testa­ment, which were mention'd before.</p><p>4. Ans. There was no need of an express Command, because it was the constant Practice of the Church, when the Scripture was written, in conformity to the Practice of the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> for many Ages before. I cannot here express my self better, than in the words of the Learned <span class="hi">Lightfoot</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note7"><span class="hi">Lightfoots Har­mony on</span> Joh. 1 25.</span> If Bap­tism and Baptizing of Infants had been as strange and unheard of a thing, till <span class="hi">Iohn</span> Baptist came; as Circumcision was <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>till God appointed it to <span class="hi">Abraham</span>; There would then no doubt, have been an express Command for Baptizing Infants, as there was for Circumcising them. But when the Baptizing of In­fants, was a thing commonly known and us'd, as appears by Uncontestable Evidence from all their Writers; there need not be express Assertions, that such and such Per­sons <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2054"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=16">[Page 14]</a></span> were to be the Objects of Baptism, when it was as well known before the Gospel began, that Men, Women and Children were Baptiz'd, as it is to be known that the Sun is up when it shines at noon day.</p><p>5. There would need a Positive Command, to exclude Infants, who were admitted into Covenant before. The <span class="hi">Iews</span> were extremely tender of their Priviledges, and you know there was a great dispute among them, whe­ther their Children should be Circumcis'd, <span class="hi">Acts.</span> 21.21. Now if their Children were wholly cast out of Co­venant, this would have enrag'd them much more; seeing therefore, there is not one word in Scripture, that once mentions the unchurching of Infants, not one A­postle, that once questions or discovers it, the believing <span class="hi">Iews</span> did not once Scruple it, nor the unbelieving once charge it on Christ; nor the Councel in <span class="hi">Acts</span> 15. Reveal it, tho they that taught Infants should be Circumciz'd, did suppose they were Church-Members. I say seeing all these things are True, Infants are Church-Members still, and consequently ought to be Baptiz'd.</p><p>6. There are Examples of whole Housholds that were Baptiz'd in Scripture, and we may well conclude, as <span class="hi">Abrahams</span> Children, In <span class="hi">Luk.</span> 19.9. Christ saith to <span class="hi">Zaccheus, Salvation is come to this House, for that he also is the Son of Abraham. Zaceheus</span> was a <span class="hi">Publican,</span> and a ga­therer of the <span class="hi">Roman Tribute,</span> and perhaps a Gentile, but upon his Faith in Christ, he becomes a Spiritual Son of <span class="hi">Abraham,</span> and Salvation comes not only to himself, but his House; God becomes a God to him and his. So when we read of so many Housholds Baptiz'd, upon the Pa­rents and Masters Believing, we have Reason to conclude their Infants were Baptiz'd, as <span class="hi">Abraham</span> and his were Circumciz'd.</p><p>7. There is no Instance of any Christian Child, whose Baptism was defer'd still he came to Years. There was great Reason that they who had been <span class="hi">Iews</span> or Heathens before, should upon their undertaking Christianity, be Baptiz'd at Years: as <span class="hi">Abraham</span> at the first Institution of Circumcision was Circumciz'd, when he was old; but we may well suppose, their Children (as <span class="hi">Abrahams,</span>) were Baptiz'd with them, and afterwards in their Infant State. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2117"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=16">[Page 15]</a></span> Now it is utterly unaccountable, that in that long tract of time, between St. <span class="hi">Mathews Gospel</span> and the <span class="hi">Revelations,</span> when many Christian Infants were grown adult, we should read of none that were Baptiz'd, but only of <span class="hi">Iews</span> and Heathens, I say this is unaccountable, and therefore supposeth they were Baptiz'd in Infancy.</p><p><span class="hi">Obj.</span> 2. Infants are uncapable of performing the Duties prerequir'd to Baptism. Of confessing their Sins, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 3.6. Of Repenting, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2.38. Of gladly receiving the word, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2.41. Of Believing, <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 16.16.</p><p>1. Infants are admitted on the account of their Pa­rents faith. As the Infants of Believing <span class="hi">Iews,</span> so are the Infants of Christians; nor is this at all unreasonable. For as Infants contract Guilt from their Parents, why may they not also partake of Mercy, on account of their Parents; except God be more inclin'd to Acts of Justice, than Mercy▪ As many were heal'd of their Bodily diseases, by the faith of their Parents, <span class="hi">Math.</span> 15.28. So why may they not be admitted into Gods Church on the same account? As the <span class="hi">Iewish</span> Infants, Covenanted with God, in and by their Parents, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> 29.11.12. So why may not Christian Infants Covenant in and by them? As Children are said to come to Christ, being brought in the Arms of their Nurses or Parents, <span class="hi">Luk.</span> 18.15.16. So why may they not be said Spiritually to come to Christ, in the Arms of their Parents Faith? As Parents enter their Childrens Names in Leases and Covenants, and the Chil­dren are oblig'd to stand to these Covenants, and do In­joy these Priviledges, when they come to Years: So why may they not enter their Childrens Names into the Cove­nant, and Church of God, tho' at present they are unca­pable of Personally Engaging themselves?</p><p>2. Infants are oblig'd to these duties as soon as they are capable; and their Early Engagements in Baptism, lay the more strong and forcible Obligation upon them to do so. If afterwards they revolt from God, their Sin will be more highly aggravated, as adding Perjury and Apostacy to the rest of their Sins: and this may be one Reason why, sometimes, the Children of Believers are worse than others, because they Sin against greater Light and Love, and stronger Engagements than other men, and therefore <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2181"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=17">[Page 16]</a></span> justly provoke the Holy Spirit to forsake them. The <span class="hi">Levites</span> of a Month Old are said to keep the charge of the Sanctuary, because they were devoted to this Office, and bound to it when capable, <span class="hi">Num.</span> 3.28. So the Infants of Believers are devoted to the Service of God: And bound to Believe, repent, confess their Sins, and gladly receive the word, as soon as capable.</p><p>3. These Texts therefore only shew what was requir'd of grown Persons, when Baptism was first appointed in the Christian Church. Those Persons were either <span class="hi">Iews</span> or Heathens before, and therefore must Renounce their former Errors, and profess the Christian Faith; but this is no Prejudice against Infants who are to be admitted with them. As when <span class="hi">Abraham</span> was Circumciz'd, he first Be­liev'd in God, and Submitted to this Ordinance, but af­terwards the Infants of the <span class="hi">Iews</span> were Circumciz'd in their Infant State<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>: So if we were to Preach to the <span class="hi">Indi­ans,</span> we must first perswade them to Believe and Repent before Baptism; but when once they had Believ'd, their Infants would have the same right with themselves.</p><p>4. As to <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 16.16. because many are apt to insist on the order of the words, and argue that Faith is put before Baptism, and therefore ought to preceed it,</p><p>I Answer: The order of the words is not always to be exactly regarded. For confessing <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>f Sin is put after Baptism<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 3.6. Besides, this would condemn all Infants; for, if, because they cannot Believe, they ought not to be Baptiz'd, then for the same Rea­son they must all be damn'd. 'Tis not positively said he that is not Baptiz'd shall be damn'd; Baptism is not of Absolute: Necessity to Salvation: But it is positively said, he that Believeth not sh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ll be damn'd. If the latter part of this verse be Interpreted of Grown Persons, so also must the<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> former. As for Grown Persons, Faith must go before Baptism: But it doth not follow, that Infants are hence excluded from Baptism, no more than▪ from Salvation. Our Saviour doth therefore here, only give a general direction to his Apostles, to Preach the Gospel to every Creature, and admit the Gentiles to the same Priviledges with the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> and shews them the Issue of the Execution of their Commission; that those <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2249"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=17">[Page 17]</a></span> <span class="hi">Iews,</span> or <span class="hi">Heathens</span> that would renounce their former Idolatry, and be<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>eving y submit to the Ordinance, as a So­lemn Entrance into the Church, should be saved; bu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> those that wilfully persisted in unbelief, shou'd be damn'd. So that this is no Preju<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ice to Infants, who are still in Cove­nant with God thro their Parents Faith, and were never cast out.</p><p>I proceed to the 2d General Question. After what man­ner, the outward Element in Baptism, ought to be ap­ply'd, whether by dipping or plunging the whole Body under Water, or whether pouring Water on the Face be not sufficient? To which I Answer,</p><p>1. It is not Absolutely Necessary that this Ordinance should be administred by dipping or plunging the whole Body under the Water. There are many mistaken Bre­thren lay too great a stress on this; but it proceeds from their ignorance of the Scriptures.</p><p>1. The Holy Ghost, never uses <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, which most frequently fignifys to dip, but <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>: Now why should the Holy Ghost consecrate a new World for this Ordinance; if dipping had been the only way of admini­string it? Now <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> is always us'd where dipping is signify'd. <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 26.23. <span class="hi">Ioh.</span> 13.26. <span class="hi">He that dippeth with me in the dish. Luk</span> 16.24. <span class="hi">dip his finger. Rev.</span> 19.13. <span class="hi">with Garments dip'd in Blood.</span></p><p>2. The <span class="hi">Greek</span> word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, is us'd in a differing sense in Scripture. Thus you read, <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 7.4. <span class="hi">The Pharisees eat not except they wash oft.</span></p><p>Now the way of washing among the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> was this; a Servant was ready to p<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ur water, on his Masters hands, hence <span class="hi">Elisha</span> is thus describ'd. 2 <span class="hi">Kings</span> 3.11. <span class="hi">Here is</span> Elisha <span class="hi">that pour'd Water on the hands of his Master</span> Eli­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ah. So we read of washing of cups and pots, Brasen Vessels, and Tables or Beds. <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 7.4. the <span class="hi">Greek</span> word is <span class="hi">Baptizo.</span> Surely they did not carry them out to a River and dip them there, but pour'd water on them, and so made them clean. Again, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 9.10. we read of divers wash­ings; <span class="hi">Baptisms</span> in the <span class="hi">Greek.</span> Now what were these Bap­tisms but <span class="hi">v.</span> 13.21. <span class="hi">Moses</span>'s Sprinkling the Book and all the People, with the Blood of <span class="hi">Calves</span> and <span class="hi">Goats</span> and Water. So that <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> and <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> signify the same thing. Let not Injudicious People therefore pretend, that ours is only <span class="hi">Rantism,</span> when we find in Scripture that <span class="hi">Rantism</span>; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2413"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=18">[Page 18]</a></span> and Baptism are us'd promisc<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ously for the same.</p><p>3. There is no certainty that dipping was ever usd in Scripture times. All those Scriptures that are commonly urg'd to this purpose, may be easily apply'd another way. If we begin with <span class="hi">Iohn</span> the Baptist, he is said to Baptize not in, but with Water, as Christ with the Holy Ghost and Fire. <span class="hi">Luk.</span> 3.16. Now how did Christ Baptize with the Holy Ghost and Fire? but at the day of pentecost when the Holy Ghost was pour'd on them. <span class="hi">Acts.</span> 10.45. I know the learned <span class="hi">Casaubon</span>'s witty Criticism that in <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2. when the Holy Ghost came upon them it is said; <span class="hi">There came a <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ound from Heaven as of a rushing might<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> wind, and it fill'd the House.</span> So that they were as in a Fish Pond Overwhelm'd with the Holy Ghost. But to this I Answer, it was the sound that fill'd the House, and not the Cloven Tongues of Fire, which were the Em­blems of the Holy Ghost, and sure they were not Over­whelm'd wi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>h these; but that promise was made good. I will pour out my Spirit. <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2.17. Now the pouring out of the Spirit, is frequently represented by pouring out water, <span class="hi">Is.</span> 44.3.</p><p>But several Scriptures are pretended for dipping; the most material are these.</p><p>1. <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 3.16. <span class="hi">Iesus went up out of the water.</span></p><p>I Answer, he might acording to the Practice of those times, go into the Water to wash his Feet, foul with Travelling, and <span class="hi">Iohn</span> might pour Water on his Face; but the <span class="hi">Greek</span> word may be render'd, he went up from the Water.

Another Scripture is <span class="hi">Acts</span> 8.38. where <span class="hi">Philip</span> and the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> are said both to go down into the Water; whence some would infer that the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> was dip'd. I Answer, they might only go down to, and come from the Water. So the <span class="hi">Greek</span> may be render'd, the Water running in the valleys. B<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t if Men will insist on the let­ter of the Text, <span class="hi">Phillip must dip himself as well as the Eunuch</span>; for they both went down.

The Principal Scripture they boast of, is <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 6.4. <span class="hi">Being Buried with Christ in Baptism.</span> Whence they argue B<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>p<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ism must represent a Burial, therefore the whole B<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>dy must be cover'd with Water. This Text we have given a distinct Answer to, in our Reflections on Dr: <span class="hi">Russel, Chap.</span> 2. <span class="hi">Refl.</span> 12.13. therefore thither I Refer the Reader, and shall only say here,</p><p>1. It is no where said that Baptism represents Christs Burial, but only that we are oblig'd to conform our selves thereby to Christs Death, Burial, and Resurrection, to die to Sin, and rise again to newness of Life: This we do whatever ri<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e be us'd.</p><p>2. In our way (if that will satisfy) there is a Repre­sentation of Christs Death▪ the pouring out of Water denoting the pouring his Blood or Soul; of his Burial, as the Face the Principal part of the Body, is put un­der the Water; of his Resurrection when the Child is taken up and deliver'd again to its Parents or O<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e­rers.</p><p>3. If they will keep strictly to the Significancy of a Burial; the Person to be Baptiz'd, must not walk into the Water, but be taken up by the Baptizer and cast down into it: for indeed the difference between our way and theirs is only this, we Baptize the face and they Bap­tize the head and shoulders too.</p><p>4. <span class="hi">Metaphors</span> must not be stretched too far, and let our Brethren take heed, how they stretch this Expressi­on so, as to Justify the Practice of others, that differ <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2620"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=19">[Page 20]</a></span> from them; you read <span class="hi">v.</span> 6. <span class="hi">our Old Man is Crucify'd with Christ.</span> H<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ce the <span class="hi">Romanists</span> infer the Necessity of Crossing in Ba<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ism; let not the <span class="hi">Metaphor</span> therefore be stretch'd too <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ar.</p><p>5. There are many more Scriptures, that have an Al­lusion to Sprinkling or pouring Water on the Face: thus we r<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ad <span class="hi">Is.</span> 44.3. <span class="hi">I will pour Water on him that is thirsty, &amp;c.</span> which is Interpreted of Gods pouring out his Spirit, and Blessing on the seed of Believers. So <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 10.22. <span class="hi">Having your Hearts Sprinkled from an Evil Consci­ence, and your Bodys wash'd with pure Water</span>: And many other places. So that our way most fairly Represents the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Christ, together with the Application of his Blood, and Spirit; and the Anabaptists of <span class="hi">Amsterdam</span> are so sensible of this, that they Generally Baptize by pouring Water upon the Head.</p><p>4. There is great probability, (if not certainty) that many were not dip'd in Scripture times. Particularly <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2.41. we read of 3000 Baptiz'd in part of a day. And this was at <span class="hi">Ierusalem</span> where there were no Rivers, but only the Brook <span class="hi">Cedron.</span> Besides these were either dipt naked, or with their Cloaths; if Naked, this would be an unseemly sight, and look as if they were full of New Wine indeed, tho' (by the way) I think that part, that is Baptiz'd, ought to be Naked, to Represent our Nakedness before God: if with their Cloaths this would be as strange, for it cannot be expected, they brought Cloaths with them at that Jun­cture, and it would have been very unseemly, to see so many Persons come out of the Water in such a condi­tion▪ and go down to their Houses, which might be at a great distance; not to mention that it was hardly possi­ble, for the 12 Ap<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>les, if we should add the 70 Disci­ples to them (<span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> y<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>he Text mentions not) to dip 3000 in so sho<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t a time, they had need have brawny Arms and an <span class="hi">Here<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>an</span> strength to do this.</p><p>Again we read <span class="hi">A<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ts</span> 9.<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.18. that <span class="hi">Saul</span> after 3 days fasti<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>g w<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s Baptiz<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d by <span class="hi">Ananias,</span> we read not that he wen<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> out of the Ho<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e; nor is it probable, that God (<span class="hi">who will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</span>) would at that time require, he should be plung'd in Cold Water, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2771"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=19">[Page 21]</a></span> which might Prejudice his Health o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Life.</p><p>Again <span class="hi">Acts</span> 16.33. The Jaylor and all his were Bap­tiz'd at midnight. 'Tis unlikely they went to a River at that time.</p><p>5. It is not the quantity of Water, but the quality that is Significant. As in the other Sacrament we are Commanded to Eat Bread and drink Wine in Remem­brance of Christ; So in this to be wash'd in the Name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost: and as in the other, it is not said what quantity of Bread we shall Eat, or Wine we shall Drink; So neither in this, after what manner the Water shall be apply'd, whether by dipping, Sprinkling or pouring Water on the Face. It might be equally pre­tended, that we must Eat and Drink plentifully at the Lords Table, because this best sets forth a Feast, as it is call'd 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 5.8. or Eat a whole Loaf to represent our partaking of Christs fulness, and receiving from him Grace for Grace: there is as much Necessity for this, as for dipping, to represent our Burial with Christ. But as a small bit of Bread, and Moderate Draught of Wine, doth significantly represent the Death of Christ; so a little Water doth as significantly Represent the cleansing vir­tue of Christs Blood.</p><p>6. It is very unlikely that dipping, which when mention'd in Scripture, is generally us'd as a token of Gods Vengeance, should in this Sacrament be us'd as a token of his Mercy. Thus the Old World was dip'd and drown'd for their Sins, Gods Vengeance fol­low'd them, and they sunk as lead in the Mighty Waters:</p><p>But <span class="hi">Noah</span> and his Family, whose entrance into the Ark, was a Type of Baptism, as that is an Entrance into the Christian Church 1 <span class="hi">Pet.</span> 3.21. They were only wet with the Rain they met with in their passage. Thus the <span class="hi">Egyptians</span> were dip'd and drown'd in the Red-Sea, but the <span class="hi">Israelites</span> were Baptiz'd unto <span class="hi">Moses,</span> in the Cloud and the Sea, 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 10.2. by the dewings of the Cloud, and dashing of the Waves. Thus the Lord Jesus shall come down from Heaven, to render Vengeance on his Antichristian Enemies, with Garments dipt in Blood. <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 19, 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. I know the usual Objection of <span class="hi">Naaman</span> the <span class="hi">Syrian,</span> of whom it is said 2 <span class="hi">Kings</span> 5, 14. <span class="hi">he dip'd him­self <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2842"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=20">[Page 22]</a></span> in the River Iordan,</span> Seven times, according to the say<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ng of the Man of God.

We pour wate<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> on the Face, the Noblest and Chiefest Part of Man That part we pour water on is naked to represent our nakedness be­fore God; and this is sufficient, and significantly repre­sents, </p><ul><li class="item">1.

The Substance of what was said on both sides is this: Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> have urged, that such as are Disciples of Christ ought to be baptized, and that some Infants are Disciples of Christ. This Mr. <span class="hi">Rus­sel</span> deny's; and they have proved it from this, That some Infants are call'd Disciples by the Spirit of God. This also Mr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> hath deny'd; So that the whole Questi­on result's to this head: Whether any Infants be in Scrip­ture call'd Disciples? Now this hath been, I think, suffici­ently clear'd from this Text, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 15.10. where the Per­sons call'd Disciples are those, upon whom the Judaiz­ing Christians would have imposed the Yoke of Circumci­sion. The Doctrine, they taught the Christian Gentiles, was, That their Christianity would avail them nothing, It was to no purpose tho' they did Believe in Christ; un­less they were also Circumcised according to the Law of <span class="hi">Moses,</span> they could not be saved. You all know what the Law of <span class="hi">Moses</span> doth prescribe and command in this case, not only, that they themselves, but that every Male Child among them should be Circumcised.</p><div class="speaker">Rus.</div><p class="p-in-sp">It is not according to the Law of <span class="hi">Moses,</span> but after the manner of <span class="hi">Moses.</span></p><div class="speaker">Rob.</div><p class="p-in-sp">Mr. <span class="hi">Russel,</span> it's true; it's after the manner of <span class="hi">Mo­ses</span> in the First verse, but if you look forward into the Chapter, you will find express mention of the Law of <span class="hi">Moses.</span> You must be Circumcised and keep the Law of <span class="hi">Moses. v. 5th.</span> I suppose you that have so oft read this Chapter, could not but be sensible that such an Expressi­on was there, tho' not in the first verse; And therefore the distinction you will pretend to make between the Law of <span class="hi">Moses</span> and the Manner of <span class="hi">Moses,</span> was but a meer Evasion, and in this case a Distinction without Diffe­rence. The one explains the other. That which is call'd their being Circumcised after the manner of <span class="hi">Moses,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8837"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=44">[Page 46]</a></span> in one place, is called their being Circumcised and Keep­ing the Law of <span class="hi">Moses</span> in the other place. They must be Circumcised as <span class="hi">Moses</span> did order, so that his Law might be observed and fulfilled in the doing of it; which it could not be, tho they themselves were Circumcised never so regularly, unless their Infants were so too. And yet the whole Body of those on whom the Pharisees would have imposed the Yoke of Circumcision, are here ex­pressly call'd Disciples; This whole Body of Adult and Infants are therefore in common included under this Name, which was all that we had to prove.

Mr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> was obliged by all the Laws of Disputation, to prove, that according to the Commission of our Lord, Baptism was to be administred by Dipping, Plunging, Overwhelming, and no otherwise. Some attempts he made towards it, of the weakness of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10089"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=48">[Page 55]</a></span> which, I doubt not but, you are all sensible; And there­fore (which yet they were not obliged to) Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> undertook to prove that it was not Necessarily to be so Administred. For the clearing of which, they have manifested that the word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> in the <span class="hi">Greek</span> as well as <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> in the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> doth not, necessarily, sig­nify any thing more than only to Wash, or, to apply water to a Person, without determining whether it shall be by dipping a Person into water, or pouring water up­on him, or any other way; so that water be applyed, it is all that can necessarily be concluded from the words. Of this they have given clear evidence both from the Old Testament and the New.</p><p class="p-in-sp">And now upon the whole, we are willing to refer it to your own Judgments, whether you will be perswaded to account your own Baptism a Nullity, because it hath not been administred in the way of these Persons. If you can without any Solid Reason, or without so much as the evidence of one single Text of Scripture, be Satisfyed, you may then take what our adversaries have said for Satisfaction. But, since it hath been fully proved, that Christ hath only required that Persons be Solemnly en­tred into his Church by Baptizing or Washing them in the Name of Father, Son and Spirit, and hath not determi­ned, so far as doth appear, whether this washing shall be performed this way or that, we are willing, I say, to refer it to the Judgment of you all, whether our way of Admi­stration be not the most commodious:</p><div class="trailer">FINIS.</div></div><div class="statement_of_accuracy" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.3"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.3. </span></h3><p>I have compar'd this Copy with the Original, <span class="hi">viz.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Maltby</span>'s and my own, and find it exactly a­greeable thereto.</p><div class="closer"><div class="dateline">Witness, my Hand, this 10th day of <span class="date"><span class="hi">Iuly,</span> 1699.</span></div> <div class="signed">W.

As we were Necessitated by the Anabaptists Challenge to the Disputation it self, so had they not (by Publishing a false account,) laid us under a like Necessity to Vindicate the Truth and our selves, the World had never more heard of this matter. In these our Reflections, we shall Manifest the Author's Egregious Falshood, in some parts of his Narrative, his Trisling Impertinencys in others, and the Uncharitable Principles that have drop'd from him.</p><p>The Narrative is pretended to be Transcrib'd from Mr. <span class="hi">Bissel</span>'s and Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span>'s Copy's. Now we can assure the World, that Mr. <span class="hi">Bissel</span>'s Copy was like a Lawyer's Breviate, containing only hints for Memory, and may be all contain'd in 3 or 4 pages, and hardly one word of it in this Narrative. As to Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span>'s, we have taken the pains to compare it with this account, and find several hundred Falshoods, Additions, Alterations and O­missions. It is an ill omen thus to stumble at the Threshold; and what begins with a Falshood, we have Reason enough to Mi­strust. But to the Narrative it self, we shall (as to some parts) shew it's Egregious Falshood as to matters of fact, and that by its Omissions of some, and misciting other particulars, as well as positive false assertions.</p><p>1. It is Egregiously false by Reason of its Omissions. Not that eve­ry Omission of a word or Sentence, (perhaps) would have ren­der'd it so; but such Omissions as alter the very State of the Dis­putation, and make it look like an<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ther thing, than it truly was, are undoubtedly to be call'd Falshoods. Should any one pretend­ing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10202"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=49">[Page 57]</a></span> to report the Psalmists Sense, <span class="hi">Ps.</span> 14.1. leave out the first words, and assure the world he said, <span class="hi">there is no God</span>; would not this be call'd a Notorious Falshood? tho the Falseness of it lies, in not relating the whole Sentence. From whence it may be collected, That it is not only asserting what was never said, but also the Omission of something that was said, may bring an Hi­storian under the Guilt of Falsifying. And whether it be not so in the present case, we shall leave the World to judge, in these few Instances.</p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh,</span> upon their frequent pressing for an Instance from Scripture, of our Practice in Baptizing Infants, happily retort­ed the Argument upon themselves, and challeng'd them to pro­duce one Instance of their Practice, as theirs differs from ours. For all that know us, know we also baptize such as are adult, up­on the Profession of the Christian Faith, that were not baptiz'd in Infancy: Nay, that we should refuse to baptize the Child of an Heathen, or other Notorious Infidel, (unless adopted by some Christian) till he become adult, and make a credible Profession of Christianity. Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> therefore press'd them for one Scrip­ture Instance of a believing, meaning a Christian Parents Child, whose Baptism was delay'd till adult. And withal, told them, That from the Death of Christ to the Death of St. <span class="hi">Iohn,</span> accor­ding to the computation of the Learned, was about 60 years, in which compass of Time, multitudes of Christians Children were become adult. Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> mention'd <span class="hi">Constantine</span> the Great as a Scripture-Instance, which was justly ridicul'd: Mr. <span class="hi">Williams,</span> as he acknowledg'd to us afterwards, thought it not of any Force, and by the intimation of his Son, alledges the Instance of our Lord, as born of a Believer, of the Virgin <span class="hi">Mary.</span> To which Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> reply'd, <span class="hi">I thought we had been speaking of the Commissi­on; now this was before the Commission.</span> Intimating, that the In­stance was not pertinent, relating to a Baptism that preceeded the Commission of our Lord; and therefore our Disputation was no way concern'd in it. Notwithstanding this, Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> would have it a pertinent Answer, Christ being the Child of a Believer. And to this he reports no Answer, but makes Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> seek to be Opponent upon it, as if confounded with this Instance, <span class="hi">pag.</span> 35. Whereas, immediately upon the Reply of Dr. <span class="hi">Russel,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson,</span> our Moderator, adds, <span class="hi">Tho Mr.</span> Leigh <span class="hi">express'd himself in so general Terms, yet the whole strain of the Discourse did suffici­ently manifest that an Instance of the Child of a Believer, properly Christian, was call'd for: Now the Virgin</span> Mary <span class="hi">was a Iew, and not then a Christian: Nor was Christian Baptism then instituted.</span> With more to the same purpose. Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> also further reply­ed, <span class="hi">That Christ was not to be imita<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ed in that, because then no Person: <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10296"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=50">[Page 58]</a></span> ought to be baptized till</span> 30; <span class="hi">not except circumcis'd at</span> 8 <span class="hi">days old,</span> as the Reader may set in the foregoing Narrative. After which Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> offer'd nothing. Now we appeal to all the World, whether when so large and distinct a Reply was made, both by Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh,</span> this man hath fairly represented our Cause, when he takes no notice at all of it. But if this Gentleman, or any of his Friends, can yet produce one Scrip­ture-Instance of the Child of a Christian Parent, baptiz'd at grown years, it will be somewhat to the purpose; and they may ha<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e the confidence to call for Instances from us, and to pretend that theirs (as distinguish'd from ours) is the Scripture-way, and most agreeable to the Commission of our Lord: But till then how unreasonable is it for them to expect Instances of our way, when they have none to produce for their own?</p><p>Again he hath omitted to tell the World, (what all that were present well Remember,) that he was put to Silence by what was urg'd from <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 19.14. to prove Infant Members of the Church-Militant upon Earth. Insomuch that after a long Silence, Mr. <span class="hi">R<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>binson</span> call'd to him, and ask'd if he had no reply to make and beg'd of him that if he had any thing to say he would speak; otherwise tell the People that we might proceed. To which Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> made a very weak reply▪ that in this Text there is not a word of Baptism, or the Commission; and Mr. <span class="hi">W.</span> instead of Answering took the Oppenancy, as in the Narrative. But not one word more from that Argument could be got from Dr. <span class="hi">Russel.</span></p><p>Besides tho' he hath conceal'd yet he cannot (himself) ha<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> forgotten, that the <span class="hi">2d.</span> Argument on our pa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t, where he was again Silence<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> was sum'd up by Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> in the words o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> our Na­rative: Then we refer'd i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> to the Gentlemen present, whether we should offer any more Argument on the <span class="hi">1st</span> Question, and <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> was thought wholly needless. Mr. <span class="hi">Robinsons</span> closing Speech on the <span class="hi">2d.</span> Question, is also whol<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>y omitted.</p><p>We forbear to mention here, how he hath omitted such passa­ges as did sufficiently expose his Ignorance to the Learned part of the company: Such a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> were his telling us once and again, that <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> was <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>f the Masculine Gender, agreeing with <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> when <span class="hi">Greek</span> Verbs admit not of Genders, tho' <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> do; and his saying <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> as if it had been with an <span class="hi">Omega</span> and <span class="hi">I Consonant.</span> So <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>. Faults for which a School Boy would deserve the lash.</p><p>And when he was not allow'd to conclude his first Argument▪ on the <span class="hi">2d.</span> Question, otherwise than with the word of the Que­stion, it will be Remember'd (tho' his Narrative hath not told us,) with how great difficulty he form'd his <span class="hi">Syliegism,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10449"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=50">[Page 59]</a></span> and how many attempts he made before he could bring the words of the Question, into the conclusion: Insomuch that our Moderator offer'd him his Assistance.</p><p>These and several other particulars which quite a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ter the Face of the Disputation, were by no means to be omitted: Nei­ther can that be call'd a True Narrative, that suppresseth <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>he Truth in such Instances as these.</p><p>2. This Narrative is false, in regard of its strange misplacing some Particulars: on which account the Reader can form no true Idea of the Disputation. So, for instance, wh<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> h<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ays concerning <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, and <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> page 34. (<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> is true) should have come in in the midst of Mr <span class="hi">William</span>'s ram­bling Discourse, betwixt Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span>'s 4th and 5th Arguments; and that about the <span class="hi">Beasts of the Field,</span> should have had its place betwixt the 1st and 2d Argument on our part for <span class="hi">Infant Baptism</span>; when Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> and <span class="hi">Russel</span> were both Rambling again. And had they been found in their proper places, as in Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span>'s Co­py, which <span class="hi">Narrative Russel</span> pretends to transcribe, they would only have serv'd to expose the Weakness of him that brought them. But as he hath plac'd them here, they serve to hide the shameful Baffle they and their Cause had by the Arguments on our side. For, as was said before, they never re-assum'd the Opponency on the fi rst Question, after the closing up the Argu­ment from Infants Discipleship. Tho Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> brings in these Two Arguments, as if they went off with Triumph, to the 2d Question. Which yet every Judicious Auditor Knows to be False. Lesser slips we pass by.</p><p>3. He hath forg'd several downright Falshoods; one of which is just under our Eye, with relation to what is immdiately be­fore said, and therefore (tho a little out of its place <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> men­tion it here. He <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> tells the World, that <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> said, <span class="hi">they might take up the <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ponency again, if they pleas'd:</span> And again, <span class="hi">that be re-assum'd the Opponen<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>y again, at Mr.</span> Leigh'<span class="hi">s Reque<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t of which h<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> was sick.</span> With much of the same sort, page 34. Which is the meer Figment of his own Brain, and not one Sy<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>able of it True. The Omission of <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> things that were <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>aid, tho' it alter the Face of the Disputation, might be Impu<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>d to a weak Imperfect Copy: But this must nee<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s be a Contriv'd and Deli­berate Falshood; nor hath he a right to be Believ'd in any thing, that dare Forge and Publish such an untruth.</p><p>But because the Preface is almost one continued Falshood, we shall particularly take notice of it.</p><p>1. He declares Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> were the sole cause of his being Engag'd in the Disputation, whereas Mr. <span class="hi">W<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>b­ber</span> hath declar'd to Mr. <span class="hi">Smith</span> and <span class="hi">Mr. Chandler,</span> that he utter­ly, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10621"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=51">[Page 60]</a></span> disliked the dispute from the Beginning, and was only thus far concern'd; seeing they would Engage he advis'd rather to Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> than <span class="hi">Mathew Cassin,</span> whom Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> had pitch'd upon. A Man that denys both the Deity and Humanity of Christ, against whom Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> hath Printed an Honest Pro­testation. And this Man tho' overturning the Fundamentals of Christianity is hugg'd by Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span>: Because he agrees with him, in the darling Notions of Believers Baptism by dipping; Which, he told the Worshipful the <span class="hi">Mayor</span> of <span class="hi">Portsmouth,</span> was a Fundamental of Religion. Thus uncharitably doth this Man shut us all out of Heaven, and confine Religion to his own par­ty, while a denyer of Christs Deity and Humanity hath been since, as well as before the Disputation, admitted into his Pul­pit, while he, as a Messenger of the Churches, was travelling busily to spread false Reports against us.</p><p>2. Another falshood which is indeed from the wrong Infor­mation of Mr. <span class="hi">Leddell,</span> (that Man of heat, which much Water cannot Quench,) is this; that he should twice go to Mr. <span class="hi">Smith</span> to compare Copys and he refus'd to do so, altho' his Copy, was then finish'd. This is a downright falshood as appears by the annexed Testimonial.</p><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><div class="statement" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_q.1_floatingText.1_body.1_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.1. </span></h3><p>To convince the World of the falseness of what is said in the 2 Page of the first leaf of Dr. <span class="hi">Russel's</span> Dedication, with Respect to my self; I do declare, that Mr. William <span class="hi">Leddel</span> never came to me but once, wh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> he ask'd me whether I had Transcrib'd what I wrote at the Disputation I told him I had not, but intended to do it.

It is false that as he says pr. pag. 8. Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> should in the midst of the dispute give him the lye, and yet could not make any thing out about it. This sentence contains as many Falshoods as can possibly be crowded into so narrow a com­pass. That Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> speaks with a loud voice, is what all that know him, know to be false. Yet this Gentleman ven­tures to say pag. 13. he bawl'd very loud; again pag. 35. Mr <span class="hi">Robinson</span> stood up, made a noise like one in a Delirious Pa­roxysm. What doth the Man mean to Write at such a rate as this?

Notwithstanding this, this Man hath the Impudence, to dedi­cate his false Narrative to him; Indeed with a Diminutive Title as if he were not Lieutenant Governour, Receiving an Imme­diate Commission from the King, but only deputy Govenour, deputed by <span class="hi">Major</span> General <span class="hi">Earl.</span></p><p>This he should have enquir'd into, before he had dedicated his Book to him.

That he was created a <span class="hi">Mandamus Dr.</span> by <span class="hi">King Iames</span> in 1688. we understand, and with how great a Price this Tool bought that priviledg, we leave the World to Jndg. But what he means by a Senate at <span class="hi">Cambridg,</span> is beyond our understanding. That he was not regularly chosen as one well furnish'd with the Learned Qualifications requir'd, his Ignorance in <span class="hi">Greek</span> we think to be a sufficient Evidence. We could also inform him to whom he apply'd himself for the better understanding of the Latine Tongue. That he also kept a <span class="hi">Coffee-House</span> in <span class="hi">Bartholomew-Close,</span> is well known to the Neighbourhood there. But supposing he he had been a Regular <span class="hi">Dr.</span> in Physic, as he stiles himself, this may no more qualify him for a Divinity Disputation than be­ing a Coffeeman. So that why he should insist on his Title, in this case, we know not.</p><p>Here we shall also take notice of another Falshood, that this bold Gentleman hath Publish'd amongst and by his Friends in <span class="hi">London.</span> Tho' he have not adventur'd it into his Narrative; one of us hath been assur'd by a Person that had it, from the Mouth of an Anabaptist of considerable note in <span class="hi">London,</span> that <span class="hi">Dr. Russel,</span> to put it out of doubt, that he and his Friends had carry'd the day at <span class="hi">Portsmouth,</span> added, the Bishop of <span class="hi">Salisbury</span> had received a Letter from <span class="hi">Colonel Gibson,</span> wherein he applauded their <span class="hi">i. e.</span> the Anabaptist's performance. That such a report hath spread abroad we are well assur'd. But that it is most Egregiously false, that Right Reverend Person whose name he hath made use of, hath given us leave to assure the World▪ He doth indeed own he had a Letter from <span class="hi">Colonel Gibson,</span> his near Kinsman, Relating to the Disputation. But to a purpose quite opposite to what this falsiefier reports; and adds, that not only the Letter he Receiv'd, but one directed to the <span class="hi">Ld. A. Bi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> of <span class="hi">Casterbury,</span> did Represent the disputation as much to our ad­vantage as could be desir'd.</p><p>To this sense his Lordship was pleas'd to express himself to Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> our Moderator, (who waited on him on this oc­casion) and Generously allow'd us to make use of his Name, for the undeceiving the World in this matter.</p><p>9. It is false, what he intimates pr. pag. 11. that when we were pinch'd upon an Argument, we made a Noise and Cla­mour that hindred the People from hearing what was said. Whereas all that were present, we doubt not, well Remember, the first disturbance we had of that kind, was that mention'd in the Narrative, pag. 35. when the Anabaptists (upon the mention of our Saviour, as an Instance of the Child of a Be­liever, not Baptiz'd till adult) rudely enough set up a shout. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11242"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=53">[Page 65]</a></span> And Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> Ignorantly cry'd, 'Tis done! 'Tis done! Tho' the Triumph was but short liv'd, for so soon as Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> reply'd to the Instance, the Body of the People return'd 'em their Civility, and set up another shout at them. Besides which, there was no further Noise or Interruption of that Nature, till that rude Comparison of Children and Beasts of the Feild, of which more afterwards. The last Interruption was when <span class="hi">Russel</span> would have put us off with a bundle of Humane Testimonys, instead of proof, and we had once and again protested against them, and given our Reasons <span class="hi">viz.</span> that we had not the Authors at hand, to try the truth of his Quotations; besides that should they have said what he would have them, their Testimo­ny would not necessarily Engage our assent, they being but fallible men. When after this he yet would trouble us with his Impertinent long Quotations, the People refus'd to hear him, and continu'd to hiss till he gave over reading; but what was said at the closing up of that head by us, doth suffi­ciently Manifest no Human Testimony can pinch us: It was the Ridiculous weakness and not the force of the Argument couch'd in his Testimonies that occasion'd that noise. And if there was any thing in it, that was a grievance to him; Let him thank his Anabaptist Friends that gave the first Example.</p><p>10. It is false, that Mr. <span class="hi">Fox</span> was dip'd by Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span>'s ad­vice, Who was not then in the Country, nor did Mr. <span class="hi">Earle</span> know him. That it was done by Mr. <span class="hi">Chandlers</span> advice, is also false; for he was then at <span class="hi">London.</span> But that none of us would refuse to dip a Person in such a case, is true. We never pleaded against dipping as one way, but as the only way; not against 'its Lawfulness, but Necessity. So that this Instance is brought in to no purpose; and Brother <span class="hi">Duke</span> should have inform'd him­self better in the Circumstances of this story, before he had con­vey'd it to <span class="hi">London.</span> Nay he was dip'd not at <span class="hi">Gosport</span> but <span class="hi">Ha­vant.</span></p><p>We shall purposely wave the Falshoods in the Narrative it self, because our own account doth sufficiently manifest them. We shall only add that the Conclusion of the Book is as false as the rest. For he says <span class="hi">p.</span> 59, 60. <span class="hi">That God was pleas'd to make the hearing of the dispute, of such use to several Persons; That they were fully convinc'd — and did in few days after, submit them­selves to 'be dip'd in Water</span>; whereas we can hear of no unpre­judiced Persons, Who were any way inclin'd towards Anabap­tism, by any thing that was offer'd in the Disputation. And we challenge them to Name us one Person so convinc'd. Those that were fix'd in their Prejudices, might perhaps take their weak Arguments and Trifling Answers for a sufficient Confutation, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11315"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=54">[Page 66]</a></span> of Infant Baptism: But we provoke them to Name one unpre­judic'd Person that did so. And do offer, for one such Person so na<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>'d by them, We will, if they demand it, tell them the Names of several who did strongly incline to Anabaptism before, who by that Disputation were set right and fully satisfy'd, that the Anabaptist cause sloth rest on weak Unscriptural Principles, how loudly soever they pretend to Scripture.</p><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.1. </span><span class="head">CHAP. II.</span></h3><p>HAving thus far manifested, how little Regard the Ana­baptist <span class="hi">Dr.</span> had to Truth in his Narrative, this were enough to be offer'd by way of reply; nor need there any thing more to discredit an History, than to shew that it is false. But we shall so far condescend to the weakness of Injudicious Persons; as to animadvert also on the Trifling Impertinencies, his Narra­tive abounds with.</p><p>1. All the Arguments they offer'd were Trifling Cavils. The First was design'd to turn off the Opponency upon us. The 2<span class="hi">d</span> supposes what was never granted them, that the only Com­mission and universal directory for Baptism is contain'd in <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 28.19. <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 16.16. For indeed if this were Christs only Com­mission. then his Disciples did Baptize <span class="hi">Ioh.</span> 4.2. without his Commission; for this Command was not then deliver'd: again, if th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s Command were design'd as an universal directory, Then previous Examination, discourses of the Significancy and Obligation of this Sacrament, stated Prayer before and after, are besides the Commission. Nay, the Apostles did deviate, from the Commission, when they Baptiz'd only in the Name of the Lord Jesus or of the Lord, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 10. <span class="hi">Vlt.</span> 19.5. this is therefore no other than extending the Commission to the Gentile World; supposing that the Practice of it both as to manner and Subjects was well known before, only then con<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ed to the lost sheep of the <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> of <span class="hi">Is<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>el.</span> So that Infants may be Baptiz'd if we can bring good proof for it out of the other parts of Holy Writ, tho it could not be prey'd from Christ's Command: For the whole Scripture is the will of Christ; and his will discern'd in this Matter, is his Commission. But supposing (not gran­ting) this to be an universal directory, We distinguish'd between Disciples, that are compleat or Incompleat. Incom­pleat may be made by the Ministry of Men.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11389"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=54">[Page 67]</a></span>1. As by the Preaching of Men, Parents may be converted and constrain'd to give up all they have and are to God, and so their Infants thus consider'd in their Parents, they are remotely made Disciples by the Ministry of Men.</p><p>2. They are immediately made Disciples by the Ministry of Men; by the Parents devoting them to God; and bringing them to his Ministers to be solemnly dedicated to him. <span class="hi">Dr. Russel</span>'s vain attempts to take off this distinction, may be taken notice of in the foregoing Narrative, to which we <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>re<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er the reader, as also to observe the little Arguments they further us'd, and weak Answers they gave to our Arguments.</p><p>2. His Reflections in the time of the Disputation it self and what he hath added, are equally Trifling and Insignificant. For Instance.</p><p>1. What he insinuates p. 6. as if in effect we gave away our cause, because we refus'd (at that time) to give an Instance, where there was any thing recorded in Scripture, that did ob­lige us to Baptize Infants, whereas it then lay on them to prove the contrary: Our business (who were the Respondents) was to attend their proof, the time was not yet come for us to produce our own. It was agreed that they who had reflected on the Doctrine of Infant Baptism as false and wholly untrue; should prove that it was so. Yet this Trifler when he had undertaken to prove, that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, At the very first would have put it upon us to prove they were so, and would perswade the company we gave away our cause, unless we did as he directed. This was Doctor like Truly! And one would not grudge, (however he came by it) to give him the Title, who does so powerfully carry all before him. You have his whole sense in these few words. Gentlemen, if I prove that Infants are not the Sublects of Baptism, you will allow I perform what I have undertaken, pag. 5. now this I'll make so plain, you shall not be able to answer or evade the force of my Argument. Thus I argue; if they be the Subjects of Baptism, Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> or some Body else is able to prove it. But therefore they are not so: And now I have effectually done your business; for if you say you can prove it, let's hear it; if not, you give away your cause. To this sense doth this mighty Man of Logic Flourish at the entrance, and Wonderful Feats no doubt he thinks he hath done in it: But such Egregious Trifling is hardly found among any pretending to the least degree above common sense. And it was fitter to have been hiss'd out, than so soberly reply'd to as it was.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11418"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=55">[Page 68]</a></span>1. What! Do you prove that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, by putting us to prove that they are. Wonderful! this 'tis to be a <span class="hi">Dr.</span> and to know more than all the World besides.</p><p>For till this <span class="hi">Dr.</span> came upon the stage, these 2 things were always very differing (to make proof of a thing, and put ano­ther to prove the contrary.) This Gentleman undertook to prove p. 5. but (as if he repented of his rash undertaking) he very courteously invites us to change sides with him, and there­by free him of a burthen that was too heavy for him.</p><p>2. Nor is every thing untrue, the contrary to which we can­not prove true. We cannot prove that this Narrative, <span class="hi">Russel</span> e­ver was at <span class="hi">Cambridge,</span> or took his Degrees there; but would he have us therefore take the contrary for certain Truth? Yes, we must, according to his method. If one boldly assert against us, That he never was at <span class="hi">Cambridge,</span> we desire they would prove it before we give Credit to 'em. In his way they'll prove it too, and then we must needs grant it. Well, we wait only for the Proof. Thus it is. You cannot prove that he ever was at <span class="hi">Cam­bridge,</span> or took any Degree there. Therefore, behold, he was not. The strange Effects of Logick!</p><p>3. Nor if we can prove it, doth it follow we needs must? es­pecially when he had undertaken the Opponency. We that stood upon our Defence (as Respondents) were only to attend to what they had to offer, and show the invalidity of it; but were by no Laws of Disputation, that ever yet were publish'd to the World, oblig'd to change sides with them and take the proving part on us. Tho' this we declare we were ready to do in due time but it was no way fit to be done at the beginning of the Disputation, unless this Doughty <span class="hi">Dr.</span> had said in plain words (as he did in effect in his first Argument,) Gentlemen, I have undertaken more than I can do. And therefore tho' I cannot prove that Infants are not the Subjects of Baptism, I should take it kindly if you would please to prove the contrary.</p><p>4. And as to his pretence, that his Proposition was an Universal Negative; Therefore we were oblig'd by it to give our Instance: It is a great mistake, and contra­ry to all the uncontested Rules of Disputation, nor could any order possibly be observ'd, if it should be admitted. For how easy were it for an Opponent in any case, thus to oblige the Respondent to change places with him—which what confusion it would create, any one that hath an insight into these things, will easily imagine. That Rule hath therefore (as far as we can find) universally obtain'd.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11467"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=55">[Page 69]</a></span> <span class="hi">Neuter Disputantium alterius partes suscipiat, neque; opponens in partem Respondentis involet, aut contra</span>; And consequently a very Principal part of the work of a Moderatot lies, in keeping each within their proper Limits. <span class="hi">Regimen praesidis in eo consistit, ut diligenter attendat, utrum Opponens &amp; Respondens suo officio fungantur necne: Si utrumque aut alterutrum ab Officio suo recedentem conspexe­rit, eum sui muneris admoneat, &amp; intra limites contineat, ne extra oleas (uti dici Solet) evagentur.</span></p><p>5. Nor will that known Rule <span class="hi">Negantu non est probare,</span> and <span class="hi">asserenti incumbit probatio,</span> mention'd by <span class="hi">Dr. Smith</span> at all avail our Anabaptist Champion: As indeed it never was intended by that Worthy Person to any such purpose, as he hath allow'd us to assure the World: and as did plainly enough appear to all the Judicious part of the Company, when he spoke those words: his design was (as the design of the Rule it self, at least when apply'd to Logical Disputations) that the Proof lies not on the Respondent, who only denies, or distinguishes upon his Adver­sary, but upon the Opponent, who is the Asserter, whether his Arguments run in an Affirmative or Negative Form. But thus much is more than sufficient to expose his ridiculous Trifling under that Head.</p><p>2. He next reflects upon Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler,</span> as if he was at a Loss, so that Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> were forced <span class="hi">to help him out with their Distinctions and Equivocable Expressions,</span> page 11, Whereas, if, Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> did offer any Distinctions, 'twas what belong'd to him, as an appointed Disputant with Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler:</span> And that they spoke promiscuously, is owing to a Proposal made by the <span class="hi">A­nabaptists,</span> that the Disputants might be allow'd it; which ac­cordingly was agreed before we went to the place of Disputati­on. So that 'tis Ridiculous Trifling for him, from Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span>'s sometimes speaking, who was allow'd equal Liberty with Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> himself, to infer <span class="hi">that Mr.</span> Chandler <span class="hi">was at a Loss, and Mr.</span> Leigh <span class="hi">forc'd to help him out.</span> And it is somewhat more than Trifling, and should be inserted among the Falshoods, what he asserts, p. 16. <span class="hi">That Mr.</span> Chandler <span class="hi">finding himself unable to answer, quitted the place of a Disputant, and Mr.</span> Leigh <span class="hi">desired to take it up, which was admitted upon condition,</span> &amp;c. Whereas it was mov'd the Night before the Disputation, when <span class="hi">the Anabaptists</span> came in a Body to us at Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span>'s House, <span class="hi">That we would admit the Principal and his Second to speak promiscuously.</span> The Reason given was, <span class="hi">Because Dr.</span> Russel, <span class="hi">or Mr.</span> John Williams, <span class="hi">had an Infirmity that sometimes disabled him from speaking for a considerable time vo­geb<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er.</span> We took till the morning to consider of the Proposal, and then at the Hour and Place prefix'd we gave that Liberty to them, provided the same might be allow'd to us, which was <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11571"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=56">[Page 70]</a></span> consented to. Upon which it was resolved on both sides, <span class="hi">That the Disputants should be allow'd to assist each other, as they saw oc­casion.</span> With what Face now can this man insinuate to the world, <span class="hi">That Mr.</span> Leigh, <span class="hi">in the midst of the Disputation begg'd leave to speak, and could not be admitted but upon Terms</span>: And all this only to set off that False Lie, <span class="hi">viz. That Mr.</span> Chandler <span class="hi">quitted the Place of a Disputant.</span></p><p>But to return to what we were upon: <span class="hi">Mr.</span> Leigh <span class="hi">help'd out Mr. Chandler with his Distinctions.</span> We grant he was helpful to him, and was chosen for that purpose, and was not Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> also to the best of his skill helpful to <span class="hi">Dr. Russel</span>? But <span class="hi">Mr. Leigh</span> helped out <span class="hi">Mr.</span> Chandler, and <span class="hi">Mr. Williams</span> did his best to help out Dr. <span class="hi">Russel,</span> tho thro the badness of the Cause, he neither did, nor could help him out. But <span class="hi">Mr. Robinson</span> helpt too with his Distinctions. 'Tis false; and his own Narrative (as it happens) will manifest it to be so; for that Distinction there mention'd by <span class="hi">Mr. Robinson,</span> is there mentioned not as his own, but <span class="hi">Mr. Chandler</span>'s; and it was only mention'd to shew the no occasion he had to spend Time in proposing such frivolous Que­stions; a sufficient Answer to which he had already had from <span class="hi">Mr. Chandler.</span></p><p>There only remains under this head, <span class="hi">Mr. Leighs</span> and <span class="hi">Mr. Ro­binsons</span> helping out <span class="hi">Mr. Chandler</span> with their Equivocable Expressi­ons. But this (<span class="hi">Equivocable</span>) like the (<span class="hi">Senate at Cambridge,</span>) is a word of the Famous <span class="hi">D<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s.</span> own coining, and therefore he best knows the meaning of it. Equivocal we have often heard of, but equivocable we know not what to make of, unless by this, added to the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> and <span class="hi">Greek</span> Instances of his Learn­ing, we be left to collect that (as he says) he was Created a <span class="hi">Dr</span> in the most proper sense <span class="hi">Ex Inhabili Materia. Doctor ex non docto.</span> Yet if he intend Equivocal Expressions, tho he charge them up­on us, they are his own peculiar Talent. Perhaps few <span class="hi">Iesuits</span> herein equal or exceed him at that sort of Weapon. If any thing said by us, was grievous to him, it was not that we us'd Equivocal Expressions of our own, but that we repeated and di­stinguish'd upon his.</p><p>3. How impertinently doth he Trifle, when he over-loaded his 3d Argument with a multitude of Propositions? Tho Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> deny'd first, <span class="hi">That the Apostle</span> Paul <span class="hi">did never declare that In­fant-Baptism is a Gospel Institution:</span> yet could he never have it prov'd. Suppose he did (which yet he neither did nor can) prove that <span class="hi">Paul</span> never declar'd it in his Writings, yet how will he ever prove that he never declar'd it at any time by word of mouth? which yet <span class="hi">if he assert,</span> he must prove. And how fri­volously doth he afterwards talk of our having in our Custody <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11705"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=56">[Page 71]</a></span> any such unwritten Tradition? We never did assert, the Apostle <span class="hi">Paul</span> did declare any such thing by word of mouth that is not written, only said, <span class="hi">he might do it,</span> and put this wonderful man to prove he did not. And how insufferably weak and trifling are all <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Reflections he hath under this Head cast upon us! While this was the Sum of what was said to his <span class="hi">Minor</span> or Antecedent. But afterwards we deny'd also his <span class="hi">Major</span> or consequent; that unless <span class="hi">Paul</span> declar'd the Baptism of Infants, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t was no part of the Counsel of God, which (by his own account) he never prov'd; nor is it indeed capable of proof, unless what <span class="hi">Paul</span> declar'd must stand instead of the whole Scripture to us. And tho the Apostle tells us, <span class="hi">he had not shunn'd to declare,</span> yet he never tells us that he had actually declar'd the whole Counsel of God, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 20.27. <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>. The word intimates he did not prevaricate with them, or fraudulently keep back any truth, that in the course of his Ministry among them, he had a call from God to deliver to them: He he did not do as <span class="hi">Peter</span> faultily did <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 2.12. <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, who with-drew, sought Subterfuges thro' a mean and Timorous Spirit, conceal'd the truth when it was most especially to be own'd by him; and for which the Apostle rebuk'd him <span class="hi">v.</span> 11. now (says he) I did not from any such mean or base Prin­ciple, suppress or hide from you, or misrepresent to you any part of the Mind of God; but have freely and boldly declar'd to you, so far as I had opportunity, and there was any occasi­on for it, the whole Counsel of God. Not that we can imagite the Apostle had any opportunity to declare the whole of what God had at any time, by any Messenger, reveal'd of his Coun­sel. Nor was there occasion he should spend his Time among them upon such Points with which they were well acquainted be­fore; especially while he had himself immediate Revelations from Heaven to communicate to them. If therefore it could (as it never can) be prov'd that <span class="hi">Paul</span> never said a word of In­fant Baptism to them, it would by no means follow that it is no part of the Counsel of God: but only, that it was no part of what was immediately reveal'd from Heaven to himself, nor a­ny thing that he needed to insist upon among them, who might otherways and sufficiently be instructed about it. We might therefore (when we had deny'd the consequence) with just Rea­son say as p. 21. Suppose but not grant that <span class="hi">Paul</span> had not spo­ken a word of Infant Baptism, yet they cannot in the least ad­vantage their cause by it. And so our Opposition stands good against that Argument; even as he himself doth represent the closing of it.</p><p>4. His Reflection upon us especially upon Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson,</span> for refusing to admit him to harrangue the People upon the words <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11789"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=57">[Page 72]</a></span> of the Commission is (if possible) yet more trifling. Was he not not allow'd to argue from the Commission? And was not that all that was fit to be allow'd him? Was he interrupted in read­ing the Text? What would the Man have! Why verily he wanted to illuminate us and our hearers with his Preach<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>nt upon the Text. Poor Ignorant Souls! He perhaps apprehend­ed we could not understand the Commission without his help. In the presence of so many Ministers and particularly of him that had the right of the place; he might have had the Civility to have ask'd leave, or to have forborn till invited to it. Be­sides he knew our company came together, not to hear a Ser­mon especially from him, but to attend a Disputation: The man must by all means Preach and having nam'd a Text, he begins, <span class="hi">This Commission is very solemnly deliver'd, wherein our Lord tells us, that all power in Heaven and Earth is given to him, and by vertue of that Power.</span>—And here he takes it ill to be interrupted.—And we must be reflected on as <span class="hi">Lucifugae Scripturarum,</span> Bats and Owls that are afraid of the Commission, and fly the light of the Scrip­ture, because we would not suffer him to go on with his Imper­tinent Harangue: As if it was all one to refuse to hear a Text of Scripture read, to as hear his Comment upon it: How excessive­ly doth this man dote on his own Labours!</p><p>5. How Egregiously doth he trifle p. 24. when because our Moderator would not suffer Mr. <span class="hi">Calvins</span> Authority to stand for an Argument, he Reflects as if he had no esteem for him. Whereas there are few Names since the Apostles days, for which he hath so great a Veneration. What? is it impossible, in this Dr's opinion, to have a Veneration for a Person, unless we take his, <span class="hi">ipse dixit,</span> and swallow down all he says without chew­ing. But doth Mr. <span class="hi">Calvin</span> any where say, That the whole of the Commission is expressed in <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 28.19. <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 16.16. And tho he say, <span class="hi">Infants are not expresly mention'd in this Command,</span> yet we are sure his Comment on the Place (which will best discover his Judg­ment) says, <span class="hi">That God includes Infants in speaking to their Parents</span>; and so that Baptism, when apply'd to Infants, is not separated<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> from Faith and teaching. And this he speaks in opposition to the <span class="hi">Anabaptists,</span> who made a great noise against <span class="hi">Infant-Bapti sm,</span> upon this Pretence. See his own words, <span class="hi">Harm. Evang. in Mat.</span> 28.19. <span class="hi">Verum quia docere prius jubet Christus, quam Baptizare; &amp; tantum credentes ad Baptismum vult recipi, videtur non rite administrari Baptis­mus, nisi fides praecesserit: ar<span class="expan"> <span class="ex">(que)</span></span> hoc praetextu multum tumultuati sum Anabaptistae contra Paedo-Baptismum; Solutio tamen non difficilis est.</span> And so goes on to answer this Argument. Wherein he hath these Words, <span class="hi">Quae olim Iudaeis data fuit promiss<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, Inter gentes quo<span class="expan"> <span class="ex">(que)</span></span> <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> hodie, necesse est.

Let the Judicious consider whe­ther <span class="hi">Calvin</span>'s Judgment and this Gentleman's be the same con­cerning this Command; and what a vain Flourish it is to bring in <span class="hi">Calvin</span> on this occasion. What he soon after adds, <span class="hi">p.</span> 24. to reflect on Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson,</span> as interrupting him, is as little to the purpose. He that pretends to Learning, and needs <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> hear any more of an Hypothetical Syllogism, than the <span class="hi">Major,</span> or conse­quent, is none of <span class="hi">Solomon</span>'s wise men. 'Twas as well known to Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> what would follow as to Dr. R. the Speaker. How is it then that he insinuates as if he answered a matter before he heard it?</p><p>6. As to what he says p. 30. about <span class="hi">Erasmus</span>'s skill about the Etymology of a <span class="hi">Greek</span> Word, 'tis most ridiculously impertinent. Mr. <span class="hi">Williams</span> had a little before, very honestly acknowledg'd, that for his part, he neither knew what belong'd to <span class="hi">Greek</span> or <span class="hi">Latine</span> and yet presently quotes <span class="hi">Erasmus</span> as reading the Commission. Go Teach all Nations, and when they have learn'd dip them. Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> remembring what he had said before, admir'd to hear him quote <span class="hi">Erasmus</span>: and therefore ask'd him whether <span class="hi">Erasmus</span> ever wrote in English? Or how he knew that he so read the Commission? But there was not a word said by any one about <span class="hi">Erasmus</span>'s skill in the Etymology of a <span class="hi">Greek</span> word, but he must still be trifling.</p><p>7. The story of the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> p. 31. is like all the rest; for Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> said not that the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> had Children, but if he had had one or more, they must not be look'd on as the Children of a <span class="hi">Pa­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>an</span>: He consider'd him not as an <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> but as a Christian. Be­sides might he not have adopted ones? Nay, might he not have Children, and be afterwards made an <span class="hi">Eunuch</span>? Beside; all this we will tell the <span class="hi">Dr.</span> what he never knew before, and what is better worth his Learning than O<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> Womens Fables. And that is, that the word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> is Equivalent to <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, and signi­fys not only <span class="hi">Eunuchus eviratus,</span> but <span class="hi">Princeps, Minister regius.</span> Thus <span class="hi">Potiphar</span> is call'd an <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> or Officer of <span class="hi">Pharaoh,</span> tho' he had a Wife if not Children. <span class="hi">Gen.</span> 39.1. So <span class="hi">Gen.</span> 40.2. The chief Butler and Baker are call'd <span class="hi">Eunuchs</span> or Officers. <span class="hi">Ier.</span> 29.2. The Nobles and Princes of <span class="hi">Iudah</span> are call'd by this same Name in the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> and <span class="hi">Greek,</span> and it is not probable they were all <span class="hi">Evirati.</span> Words have a different Signification in differ­ing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12100"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=58">[Page 74]</a></span> Ages; and tho' this word bear an Infamous sense in this Age, yet formerly it had a more Honourable Signification. It would be we think profane and grating to Christian Ears, for any to call the sweet Ordinance of singing Psalms, by the Name of <span class="hi">Ballad</span> Singing, as this <span class="hi">Dr.</span> doth in his Animadversions upon his Brother <span class="hi">Allen</span>'s Essay on that Subject. Tho' he Justify's himself from the Old Translation that calls the Song of Songs, the <span class="hi">Ballad</span> of <span class="hi">Ballads</span>; he might as well say <span class="hi">Paul</span> was a Knave, because the same. Translation calls him the Knave instead of Servant of Jesus Christ. To apply this to our purpose, the word <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> tho' now us'd in an Infamous, was once us'd in an Honourable sence, and the most Learned Critics tell us that this Noble Man had no such Infamous Character, but was high Treasurer or Chamberlain to Queen <span class="hi">Candace.

Another Trifle you find, <span class="hi">p.</span> 32. <span class="hi">That</span> them <span class="hi">cannot agree with Nations, because them is Masculine, and Nations Neuter</span>; but <span class="hi">Rela­tivum cum Antecedente concordat genere, numero &amp; Persona.</span> Alas, poor Dr.! did you read this in your <span class="hi">Latin</span> or <span class="hi">Greek</span> Grammar?

That by the Figure <span class="hi">Synthesis­quando<span class="expan"> <span class="ex">(que)</span></span> relativum ad intellectum seu sensum non ad vocem conforma­tur.</span> And you have a Scripture-Instance for it, <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 4.19. <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>.

But the <span class="hi">Dr.</span> hath recourse to Mr. <span class="hi">Gosnold</span> for his Assistance, who tells him that the Antecedent must be not the Verb, as he said in the dispute, but the Noun <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> but where is this to be found?

How Impertinently doth he Harangue, (by way of Apology chiefly) pag. 35.36.37, for his having se<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> our Infants upon a level with brutes. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> all that he can say, can neve<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>x­cuse that beastly Comparison.

We must confess we said little to it, as thinking it ra­ther deserv'd stripes than an Answer. And the Honourable <span class="hi">Colonel Gibson</span> did profess to us, (the day after the Disputation) that he was so offended at it, that he would thereupon have quitted the place, had not some Gentlemen near him Prevail'd with him to stay, telling him if he went off, there was Danger, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12437"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=59">[Page 76]</a></span> the provok'd Multitude would do him some mischief. And truly an higher <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> cannot be put upon any Parent, than to make his Infants no better than Brutes.

And for others, they are not concern'd how God will deal with them. That Man can never be truly concern'd about the Salvation of his Child, that never was Solicitous about his own. But after all what strange kind of Salvation, what befor e unheard of Heaven hath this Gentleman discover'd for Creatures, between whom and beasts there is no disparity! What! No difference, no unlikeness at all! For we hope he may have Learning enough to know the English of <span class="hi">Di<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>paritas.</span> Well! (whatever this <span class="hi">Dr.</span> can satisfy him­self with,) we do both for our selves and dear Babes, wait and pray for such a Salvation and such a Heaven, out of which are excluded all Dogs and Hogs, and all of beastly Capacities and Inclinations, whether you take the Word Brute in a Natural or Moral Sense. Yet left this Man should think his Retortion, as he calls it, unanswerable, we add, there is a vast disparity be­tween Beasts and the Youngest Infants. For (as was hinted<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> in the time <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> the Disputation,) (tho' this Narrative not only omits but deny's it,) Supposing them utterly uncapable of the Dutys, yet no one can deny but they are capable of the Blessings and Priviledg<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> the Baptismal Covenant.</p><p>They are capable of being Pardon'd, Justify'd, Sanctify'd and Clerified, and is it so with Brutes? But further, Infants are ca­pable of being oblig'd to the Duty of the Covenant, tho' they be not in a present Capacity to discharge them. Thus the <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Infants by Circumcision were oblig'd to the Dutys of that Covenant, tho' during their Infant state they could not actually discharge them. If they had not been thus oblig'd how could they upon their after-forsaking God, be call'd Covenant<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Breake<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, as we fin<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> they are <span class="hi">Ezek.</span> 16.8.59. and oft else­vvhere. Their Circumcision made them Debtors, brought them under obligation to the Law, <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 5.3. Lastly, Infants have a Fundamental and remote Capacity, to discharge the Dutys of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12556"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=59">[Page 77]</a></span> The Covenant; tho' they have not an immediate Capacity for <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>it.

Tho' so soon as they have a being, they are capable of the Blessing of the Gospel Covenant; and as to the Dutys of the Covenant which is all that remains to be consider'd in it, they have such a Reasonable understanding Nature, as doth remotely capacitate them for the discharge of these Dutys, and that doth most nearly and immediately Capacitate them to come under Obligations thereto: So that Infants (as uncapable as any of ours,) have been all along (<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ver since there was a Sacrament appointed for that purpose,) Solemnly enter'd into Covenant with God, tho' we never find that any Brutes were.</p><p>11. What an Impertinent Trifler doth this Man shew him­self again, pag. 37. when instead of proving that Dipping is the only way of Baptizing, He would have put us to prove that Sprinkling is the way. That 'tis not the only way we Grant; that it is not a Lawful way he can never prove. But the Que­stion was not whether that was <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> way: But whether Dipping, Plunging, Overwhelming was the only way? And when we held him to the proof of that, He knew not how to alter the Argument, so as to bring the words of the Question into the Conclusion of his <span class="hi">Syllogism</span>: We then perceiv'd him to be <span class="hi">Cleri­cus in Libro</span>; and that, when put out of his Road, he was lost. However that he might seem to say somewhat he told the Com­pany, <span class="hi">his Argument was an Induction.</span> It should be remembred, that he had lately been confounded by Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span>'s Induction: and many Reasons concur, to make it probable, that he scarce ever heard so much as <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>he Name before. But with them that understood t he thing as little as himself, a hard word would make it look as if he had somewhat to say. This therefore must be an Induction. But his Argument he brought being only level'd against one particular thing, (which the Nature of an Inducti­on doth not admit,) Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> told a pleasant story from the late Bishop of <span class="hi">Worcester,</span> of a Covey of Patridges which yet was but one. Adding, here we have as Wonderful a thing, <span class="hi">an Induction of one.</span> What he adds afterwards is what we suppose he may have Learn'd since his return to <span class="hi">London,</span> for we Remem­ber nothing of it. Nor is it in any of the Copys, whether on our side or theirs.</p><p>12. His Argument from <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 6.4. pag. 38.39. is very Frivolous: Because we are said to be <span class="hi">Buried with Christ in Baptism,</span> therefore it must necessarily be by Dipping. This was distinctly Answer'd by Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> in his Sermons: But <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12632"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=60">[Page 78]</a></span> because the main stress of the Anabaptists cause in this pointlys upon it, We shall not satisfy our selv<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o have gravel'd them in the Disputation, whe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> we deny'd bo<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> parts of the Argument as they form'd it; neither of which they were able to prove: But for the help of such as need <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, Shall set this matter in a clear Light; In order <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o which let it be con­sider'd, </p><ul><li class="item">1.

The former the Apostle says: The <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ter only Dr. <span class="hi">Russel</span> and his Brethren. We are (as the Apostle largel<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">T<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>at. Rom.</span> 6.3.4.5.6.) <span class="hi">Baptiz'd into Christs Death, Buried, Resu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rection.</span> That is, we are solemnly enter'd into the Christian Covenant, which is founded in, and secur'd by, <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Death<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Bu<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>, and Resurrecti­on of our Lord; Which thereupon most strongly obliges us to Die unto Sin, rise to, and walk in, new<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ess <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Life: But where doth he say a Syllable to intimate that our Baptism must repre­sent these things? Our Baptism is to oblige us hereto<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> and is accordingly urg'd by the Apostle, for that purpose, throughout this context: But we would beg any one to shew us any Intima­sion, that our Baptism is to represent these things.</li><li class="item">2. And if Baptism must represent these things, it must repre­sent all as well as any of them. There is at least as great if not greater evidence from the Context, That <span class="hi">the Death of Christ, the manner and likeness of it,</span> as that <span class="hi">the manner of his Bu­rial</span> should be Represented in our Baptism. For besides that we are said to be Baptiz'd <span class="hi">into is D<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ain, v.</span> 3. we are also said to be <span class="hi">planted in the likeness of is Death. v.</span> 5. whereupon <span class="hi">v.</span> <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> it follows, <span class="hi">our Old Man is Crucify'd with him.</span> But we are no where said to be planted in the likeness of his Burial. Now what is there in your Administration, that doth represent the likeness of Christs Death, his Crucifixion? By the same Rea­son that you would prove dipping necessary in Baptism, a Pa­pist or any other Person may prove crossing necessary too, and therefore the same Answer will Inva<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>dat<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> both: <span class="hi">i. e.</span> that nei­t<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er of them are requir'd to be represented.</li><li class="item">3. 'Tis as Trifling, what he adds pag. 39. where he says Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> grants that Baptism doth signify a Burial and Re­surrection. Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> only suppos'd, did not grant it: Be­sides if he had granted it, it would not thence follow, that it must necessarily be by dipping. For, <ul><li class="item">1. In our way, by pouring water on the Face, we represent Christs Death; the pouring out of his Blood and Soul: His Burial; The Face, the Principal part of Man being put under­water, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12818"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=60">[Page 79]</a></span> or having water poured on it, as Earth is poured on a Dead Body: His Ressurrection; When the Child is taken up and deliver'd again to its Parents or Offerers. This is a sufficient Allusion in Christian Sacraments, which are Com­memorative of what is past; and there needs not a more exact Re­semblance. Na<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, it is as significant as breaking Bread, and pouring out Wine, to Represent the Sacrific'd Body and Blood of Christ.</li><li class="item">2. If they will keep strictly to the Significancy of a Burial, the person to be Baptiz<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> must not walk into the water, but be taken up by the Baptizer, and cast down into it. For indeed there is only this difference between our way and theirs: We Baptize the Face, and they Baptize the head and shoulders too: Unless the Person going down into the Water, may be said to baptize himself. And then there are more <span class="hi">Se-Baptists</span> among them than we ever understood before.</li><li class="item">3.

We would only here ask the Dr. these Two Civil Questions, <ul><li class="item">1. Whether he might not have spar'd all his <span class="hi">Dutch?</span> seeihg <span class="hi">Doope</span> in that Language signifies only <span class="hi">to wash,</span> and is us'd when they only pour on Water?</li><li class="item">2. Whether his Anabaptist Friends at <span class="hi">Amsterdam</span> do practice a Right Baptism? If not, whether he would Baptize them again, or exclude them from the Church of Christ, as he doth us in his Closing Prayer of which more <span class="hi">Anon</span>? If he owns their Baptism Lawfull, Then why such a C<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>amour and Noise about a Circumstance?

As to his Humane Testimonys, They are of little va­lue with us, for the Reasons given in the Disputation: And it was an Evidence of the wretched weakness of his cause, that these must stand instead of an Argument with him. These Testimonys he hath chiefly borrow'd from <span class="hi">Danvers,</span> and how Imperfectly and lamely they are quoted may be seen in Mr. <span class="hi">Wills</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Baxters</span> Answers to him. So that to wast time and Paper about them is but <span class="hi">actum agere</span>: We shall therefore only put these following querys to him.</p><ul><li class="item">1. Will you stand by the Authority of these Men in other Matters? If not, why would you have us in this?</li><li class="item">2. Do any of these say that to wash is not the New Testament sense of the word Baptize? Or do any Answer those places we brought? Or prove us in the wrong? Or how many places can any bring where it necessarily signifys to dip? We take not Mens Opinions upon Trust, but Trial.</li><li class="item">3. How few are there of those Learned Authors, who have not adher'd to that in <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 12.7. <span class="hi">I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</span> To Justify their Baptizing with a little Water in these Cold Countreys?</li><li class="item">4.

Will not the Opinion and Practice of so many Thousand Men, great for Learning and Piety at this day, argue more strongly for us; than these Mens Opinions only, without their Practice do against us?</li></ul><p>15. We have another Trifle pag. 45. They had pleaded <span class="hi">Philip</span> and the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> went both down into the Water. It had been reply'd that the word only signify'd they went down to the Water. But Mr. <span class="hi">Iohn Williams</span> ventures upon a <span class="hi">Greek</span> Criti­cism, and tells us, he was inform'd there were 2 differing words in the <span class="hi">Greek</span> Text, where 'tis said <span class="hi">v.</span> 36. they came unto a cer­tain Water, and <span class="hi">v▪</span> 38. they went into. This <span class="hi">Dr. Russel</span> con­firm'd and thereupon, (as they represent the Matter,) Mr. <span class="hi">Leigh</span> concess'd. There is a word for you. 'Tis well we understand a Little Latine: Otherwise this Man would quite Silence us. But <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13011"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=61">[Page 81]</a></span> to the Point: who ever told them there were 2 differing words in the <span class="hi">Greek,</span> told them true. And we are very ready to concess, or (as we would chuse to speak, consent and yeild to Truth. The words are <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> and <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>; and the true reading of <span class="hi">v.</span> 36th is, <span class="hi">As they went on their way, they came by, near to, or over against, a certain Water</span>: <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, with an Accusative, well admits such a reading. And <span class="hi">v.</span> 38. they went both down out of the Chariot <span class="hi">unto</span> this Water. How well do these 2 verses Answer each other? and where's the difficulty this wonderful Critic hath left upon us? <span class="hi">But, What need of going down to the Water, unless he were to be dip'd? A little might have been brought up into the Chariot if Sprinkling would have serv'd the turn.</span> In answer to which we say.</p><ul><li class="item">1. His going down to, or into the Water, doth no more prove that the <span class="hi">Eunuch</span> was dip'd, than that <span class="hi">Philip</span> was; for both went down.</li><li class="item">2. 'Tis Improbable he was dip'd, being then on a Journey, and having no cloths to change. <p>And if you still ask why they went down?</p></li><li class="item">3. 'Tis not certain, they were provided with a vessel to fetch up Water in.</li><li class="item">4. There was not convenient Room in the Chariot for the performance of the Action, and what was to attend it. 'Tis not to be doubted, but it was attended with Prayer: your selves, we hope, would not administer Baptism without Prayer, before, or after, or both. But what Room could there be in a Chariot, for these two Persons to place themselves in a Praying posture? It would neither admit them, (at least if of the Modern form) to stand nor kneel without uneasiness—Which alone might be a sufficient Reason, for their coming down out of the Chariot, if there were no other.</li></ul><p>16. How he trifled about the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> Bible, and how fasly he Represents that matter appears by our Narrative. Mr. <span class="hi">Ring</span> had given over writing long before this, and Mr. <span class="hi">Bows</span> and Mr. <span class="hi">Webber</span> were asham'd of their <span class="hi">Goliah,</span> and therefore about this time basely deserted and left him alone. The true account in short is this. Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> told <span class="hi">Dr. Russel</span> that <span class="hi">Baptizo</span> was so far from always signifying to dip, that <span class="hi">Bapto</span> it self sometimes signifys to wet or wash; And mention'd that Text. <span class="hi">Dan.</span> 4.33. <span class="hi">Nebuchadnezzar was wet with the dew of Heaven,</span> in the <span class="hi">Greek</span> it is <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>. To which <span class="hi">Russel</span> reply'd the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> is not <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> To which Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> return'd the <span class="hi">Greek</span> word we were then <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13124"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=62">[Page 82]</a></span> inquiring into. However, to try his skill in <span class="hi">Hebrew,</span> who had so shamefully falter'd in the <span class="hi">Greek,</span> he was ask'd what the <span class="hi">He­brew</span> word was. He said, if he had an <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> Bible he could tell. Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> handed his, being <span class="hi">Athias</span>'s 2<span class="hi">d Edit. Amstel.</span> 1668. with the Books in <span class="hi">Latine</span> Letters, plac'd after the same order with other <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> Bibles. He could not find the place, but read <span class="hi">Gen.</span> 1.1. which he also falsly Pronounced. Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> re­turn'd: Sir we come not hither, to inquire whether you can read <span class="hi">Hebrew,</span> but what the <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> word is in this place. Then Mr. <span class="hi">Robinson</span> folded down the place for him: On which he mutter'd something to himself, which his nearest Neighbours could not hear; and said the word was not there. But he hath not told us to this day what the word is. <span class="hi">Hebrew</span> Bibles are all misplac'd with him; for we hear from good hands that at <span class="hi">Ha­vering</span> in <span class="hi">Essex,</span> he was confounded with the same place, and could not find the Prophecy of <span class="hi">Daniel.</span> Now we would be­friend him against he <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ngages in the next Heckny Prize, and inform him of a great Secret; That <span class="hi">Daniel</span> is mostly <span class="hi">Chaldee</span> and the word there is not <span class="hi">Tabal</span> but <span class="hi">Zavang</span> <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, a word of the same Import. And this Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> understood, not before he was Born, but before the Creation of <span class="hi">Dr. Russel.</span></p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13219"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=62">[Page 83]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">4.2. </span><span class="head">CHAP.

But there is yet one thing further, that may help to discover the man, and that, is the <span class="hi">Narrow</span> and uncharitable <span class="hi">Principles,</span> that have drop'd from him; and these we shall briefly animadvert upon.</p><ul><li class="item">1. In the very first page of the Narrative, Speaking of Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span>'s <span class="hi">Thursday</span> Lectures at <span class="hi">Portsmouth,</span> he tells you they were manag'd, so as was to the <span class="hi">Grief of such as truly Fear God in those parts.</span> Why! What was the Offence? He tells you it was given out, that Mr. <span class="hi">Chandler</span> would not only prove Infant Baptism from Scripture; but also furnish his hearers with Arguments to defend their Practice. Why! We cannot Imagine how this should grieve any that truly Fear God. To have a truth prov'd, a truth about which so ma­ny good Men differ, to have it clear'd from Scripture Testi­mony, to have the Oracles of God unfolded about it: 'Tis strange this should be grievous to any: Yes (says he) <span class="hi">It was to the Grief of them that truly Fear God in those parts.</span> We are at a loss to know the Reason why it should be grievous to any such, and here he will not help us out. However (say we,) was it to the grief of such as were perswaded of this Truth! Were they griev'd to have it clear'd up and be furnish'd with Arguments for the defence of it? This can't be his meaning. Every one is pleas'd to see what he believes to be the truth, set in a clear Light—those that were for the Baptism of Infants could not be griev'd at it: No, that he doth not say, but those that <span class="hi">Fear God, that truly Fear him,</span> were grieved at it. So that (with him) none that are for Infant Baptism in those parts will be allowed truly to Fear God. Not one besides the poor Bap­tists, as he calls them, pag. 2. here's Charity with a Witness! All the Regular Members of the conforming and non-conform­ing Congregations, are censur'd as destitute of the true Fear of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13281"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=41362&amp;page=63">[Page 84]</a></span> God! Pray <span class="hi">Dr.</span> your Reason for this! Will you condemn us and not tell us why? What is there in the notion of Infant Baptism that is inconsistent with the Fear of God? Why may not a Person be of Opinion, that he ought with the greatest seriousness to devote and consecrate his Children to God; and enter them by Baptism into his Covenant, and bring them under early bonds to him, and yet for all this <span class="hi">truly Fear God</span>! Nay the rather do it, because he truly Fears God?</li><li class="item">2. That he may shew it is not an unwary Expression, but his deliberate Judgment; He doth in the very last Paragraph of his Pamphlet lay the same stress on the Point of <span class="hi">Dipping.</span> His concluding Prayer is, that as God had made the hearing of the dispute of such use to several Persons, that they were fully convinc'd, and did a few days after sub­mit to be dipt—So it may be of like use to many others in the Reading—That so there may be <span class="hi">added to the Church such as shall be say'd.</span> Such a Prayer scarce ever before appear'd in Print, made up of falshood and uncharitableness. It is amazing to us that a man dare venture into the presence of God with a <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> in his Mouth, and such uncharitableness in his Heart. The <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>lshoo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> we have animadverted upon, <span class="hi">Cap.</span> 1. Paragraph 10.
