stamp them well down with the end of an Iron Pestle, and make the Coppel very close and hard every where, then make it hollow in the middle, that it may hold the Matter you mean to Coppel without running over; make it very smooth, then set it into the Coppelling-place, and raise it with any sifted Ashes, or with a piece of a fire-stone, so that the top of it may be level with the lower part of the gap. Then cover the Coppel­ling-place with two bricks, (I use two bricks, because I can lift up one of them to put the Metal into the Coppel, and leaving the other brick, the Coppel is not all uncovered, as it would be if it were covered with one whole stone.) Then having kindled the 🜂 in the Furnace, cover it as before, and blow the Bellows, and the flame finding no way out, is forced and driven into the Coppelling-place, where it reverberates upon the Cop­pel, which when you see that it is well nealed, lift up one end of the hithermost brick, and put in the ♄, the quantity whereof must be proportioned according to the impurity of the Matter you mean to Coppel; if it be <span class="hi">Ster­ling</span> ☽, you must take four parts of ♄ to one of ☽; if it be any other mixture of impure Metal, you must take five, six, or seven parts of ♄ to one of the Metal, according to the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7541"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95992&amp;page=82">[Page 142]</a></span> impurity of it. Govern the 🜂 so, that the Coppel may always work and flow, and you may leave a little space between the two bricks, through which you may look into the Coppel to see how it worketh, and if you see that it requires more flame than the Sin­ders, or Charcoal will afford, you may put into the Furnace a round thick piece of wood; but you must observe, that when the Cop­pelling-place is come to be red-hot all over, and the bricks also that cover it, the Coppel will then work with a very gentle 🜂, so that then you must blow but gently; for if then you should give strong 🜂, the Matter in the Coppel would boyl too fast, and would spat­ter about.</p><p>Instead of an Iron Hoop, many times I use but an earthen Porringer, to make a Cop­pel, filling up the Coppelling-place with any Ashes round about the Coppel, and find that it doth altogether as well, only that it serves but for once.

Sir</span> K. D. <span class="hi">made the bargain between the Lord and the Doctor, who was to have five hundred pounds for the Cure: But when the Lord was Cured, he would give the Doctor no more than three hundred pounds, saying, that five hundred pounds was too much money, and that all the Ingredients be used could not stand him in twenty shillings.</span> The Remedies were thus: Having first well purged the Patien<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> with some fit Purge (as of <span class="hi">Iallap, Manna, Sena</span>) to carry away watry humours, he gave him the following Broth. A moderate Broth was made of Mutton, Chickens, and Capon, or Hen, but not Veal; the Broth was not strong of the Meat, nor too weak, but such as the Patient might drink all the day, for he was to drink no other Liquor; they made but about a pottle of Broth at a time, for it would not keep: And for this quantity they took a Gallon of Water, into <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9894"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95992&amp;page=112">[Page 202]</a></span> which the Doctor put above a handful of Garlick, and Rosemary, Penyroyal, Thyme, Sweet-marjoram, Fennel-roots, Parsley-roots, as also Currans, and a sufficient quantity of Salt. And after some days taking the Broth, they put into every draught of the Broth (the Patient took) above a spoonful of the crude juice of Garlick, stamped and pressed out. But if you cannot bear always to drink this Broth, then use the following De­coction: Take <span class="hi">Sarsaparilla</span> ℥xij. <span class="hi">China</span>-roots ℥v. <span class="hi">Sassafras</span> ℥iij. Cut all these very small, and pour upon them Spring-water, to three fingers breadth above the Ingredients, and let them infuse over a soft fire the space of four hours; then throw away this Water, and stamp the Ingredients in a Stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle: Then pour upon them ten quarts of Fountain-water, and boyl it in a Vessel close stopped, till four quarts of it be consumed: Of this Decoction let the Pa­tient drink, without any other drink but the Garlick Broth.</p></div><div class="recipe" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.34"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.34. </span><span class="head">Another Drink.</span></h3><p>TAke all the aforesaid Ingredients, in the same manner prepared and stamped: Then take a clean Vessel, and fill it with Beer, then put the Ingredients in a bag, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9915"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95992&amp;page=112">[Page 203]</a></span> hang it in the Beer; ℥j. of the Ingredients is sufficient for a quart of Beer.

Secondly, by the same Rea­son you lose a great part of the subtilest Spi­rit, which will ascend before you have poured in the quantity of the dissolution above-men­tioned, and before you can fit on the Head and Recipient. To prevent all these incon­veniences, I make use of a Tin Cucurbite, with a Spout in the upper part <span class="hi">(See it in the third Figure)</span> and having placed it in the Fur­nace in Sand, I put in the Quick-lime, and then I fit a Glass Head and Recipient, and having well luted all the junctures with wet Bladders, or Paste and Paper, I pour in the dissolution of 🜹 by a funnel through the Spout; then I close the Spout, and distill; with a gen­tle fire. When the distillation is over, take out the <span class="hi">Caput Mortuum,</span> and make the Cu­curbite clean, and wipe it dry, that it may not rust or canker, and it will serve for many other Operations, and will save you the buying of many Glass Cucurbites, which by reason of their thick and knobbed bottoms are so apt to break.</p></div><div class="recipe" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.72"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11636"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95992&amp;page=138">[Page 252]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.72. </span><span class="head">The Volatile Salt of Tartar, as I have often made it, which is an Excellent Re­medy.</span></h3><p>TAke Lees of Wine, (which you may have from the Wine-Coopers when they have pressed them out for making of Vine­gar) break them in small pieces, and let them dry; then being very hard and dry, bruise them grosly, and fill an Earthen Re­tort with it, or a Glass one coated; distill in naked fire, fitting any Recipient to it to receive only a sour flegm, which will come over first; as soon as you see any white fumes come over, (among which cometh the Vo­latile Salt) change the Recipient, putting on another pretty large; lute the junctures well with Paste and Paper, then increase the fire by degrees, until you see the Recipient filled with white fumes; continue the fire in that degree, untill those white Vapours diminish, and that the Recipient beginneth to grow cold: Then augment the fire to the highest degree, to force all over at last; when nothing more cometh over, cease.
