## 1\. The CONDEMNATION OF VVHIG and TORY.

I am neither Whignor Tory,

But a Subject truly Loyal,

As you'll ſee by what's before yee;

Who ſtill does pray for the Royal

C. R.

SIrs, What's the matter? 's all the World grown mad?

Or is't our Iſle alone, that with this ſad

Diſtemper is poſſeſs'd? Surely we,

Our Stately Bedlam built by Propheſie:

To two Extreams we all do madly run;

And Moderation (which ſhould heal us) ſhun.

Better it were, both th' Tories and the Whiggs,

Had ſpent their time in whipping Tops and Giggs,

Than thus diſturb our Peace, make ſuch a ſtir,

For and againſt a Popiſh Succeſſor;

When God knows whether it be ſo or no;

Or if it be, can change him from a Foe

To our Religion, make him a Faithful Friend,

And Zealous Proteſtant before his End;

Or if we have not Faith enough to hope

For his Redemption from the French and Pope.

Yet God can us preſerve from all our Fears,

By adding many more to Charles his Years;

Who (Thanks to Heaven) yet does fill the Throne,

And may do (till Rome's Downfall) if my own,

And other Prayers be heard, who daily cry

For Heavens Bleſſings on His Majeſty;

For's long and happy Reign, and 'twould become

Others to do ſo, rather than beat the Drum,

And noiſe abroad their Fears, diſtract the Rout,

And kindle Flames they know not to put out;

Provoke His Majeſty, and all becauſe

They cannot have their Will o'th King and Laws;

And therefore rob him of his People's Hearts,

(It's Felony, I'll prov't whoever ſtarts)

His Right to them's undoubted, they're his Store,

His Strength, his Wealth, who ſteals them, makes him poor.

Does wrong him more than he that takes your Purſe

Wrongs you, or he that fairly ſteals your Horſe.

But there are others whom I muſt not ſpare,

Who contribute (at leaſt) as large a Share

To our Diſtractions, and while they pretend

To greater Loyalty than others, bend

Their Wits, their Actions, Pens, their Tongues and Lips,

The Splendor of our Sovereign to eclipſe,

By crying up the High-born Prince, his Brother,

As if the World, nor we had ſuch another,

When (Thanks to Heaven) we have the Elder Brother.

Him they extol, of him all places ring,

They'l ſcarce allow's to cry God ſave the King.

Drink but the King's Health, before 'tis half gone round,

Th' other muſt follow, and muſt all confound

That take it not, or they muſt drink, or die,

Or fly the place, or fight the Company.

Such their Devotion is to th' Riſing Sun,

They cannot ſtay untill our day be done.

But hold, bold Wights, too forwardly you run,

Our Sun ſhines bright, and's little paſt its Noon;

We hope to bask ſtill in his warmer Beams,

And when toward Evening he caſts larger Streams,

To reſt our ſelves under the quiet Shade,

His happy Government for us has made.

I hate to ſee him joſtled from his Throne,

Or in it either, be't by more or one,

That ſeek to eclipſe his Glory, drown his Name,

With the loud Noiſes of the growing Fame

Of James the Second, a Prince whom I admire;

But ſtill Great Charles his Name muſt ſound the higher.

It grieves and vexes too, ſometime to a Rage,

To hear him treated, as going off the Stage,

As if his Work were o're, his Race were run,

And only gaz'd at, as the Setting Sun.

And though he's ſprightly, ſtrong, ſound, brisk and brave,

Yet they'll needs have it, he's one Foot i'th Grave.

All to call off the People's Hearts and Eyes,

From him to th' Sun they look ſhould next ariſe.

But Heaven will diſappoint their Hopes, I truſt,

By bleſſing Charles with a Long Reign and Juſt,

Removing Jealouſies and cauſleſs Fears,

Both from his Commons and his Loyal Peers,

Creating mutual Confidence in both,

The want of which has caus'd (I'm very loath

To ſay) how many Miſchiefs, and how great

I'd rather try to find out a Receipt,

To cure our Ills, they're only to repeat.

The while the World ſtands we can ne'er expect,

From a prevailing Party, Faction, Sect;

But from an Union of True Proteſtants,

(And Oh, 'tis that our Kingdom Chiefly wants)

And a right Underſtanding 'twixt our King,

And all his Faithful Subjects, who do bring

Hearts full of Loyalty, and Zeal to ſerve

Him, and their Country, and both to preſerve.

And when he calls, may he a Parliament

As ready find, to own confeſs, repent

Th' unkindnes, raſhneſs of ſome Votes that paſt

The lower Houſe: As forward yet at laſt

To treat their Royal Sovereign with all true

Reverence and Obedience which is due

To Sacred Majeſty; t' accept, embrace

His Royal Offers (made with ſo much Grace)

To joyn with them in whatſoever ſhall

Be thought effectual to ſecure us all,

Againſt, alas, our too juſt Fears of Rome,

Both at the preſent, and for time to come.

(One thing excepted only) and let't ſtill

Excepted be for me, while thoſe that will

Approve themſelves good Patriots, do betake

Themſelves to find Expedients, or to make

Such into Acts, as by his Majeſty,

In a late Speech was laid before their Eye,

As means effectual thought, for to reſtrain

Papiſts and Popery breaking in again.

But let not be forgot then due Supplies,

T' enable him to ſuccor his Allies.

(Who muſt a Prey be to th' devouring Bands

Of the proud French, 'leſs reſcu'd by his Hands;)

And to reſtore the Grandeur of his Court,

Enable him to relieve thoſe reſort

To him for Shelter, who do hither fly,

To ſhun the Cruelties of Popery.

To maintain his Right, and Honor of the Seas,

Curb the Inſulting Pirates that diſ-eaſe

And plague our Merchants ev'n as they pleaſe.

Nay, let him know when you've been very kind,

The reſt, in's Peoples Purſes that's behind,

'S ready at's Call, to defend him and's Iſles,

From French, Turk, Pope, Papiſts, and all their Wiles,

That Popery ne'er enter here agen,

And let the People cry Amen, Amen.

FINIS.
