### 1.1.

_[figure]_

LEt all Loyal Subjects look well to their Hits,

For Popiſh Contrivers are out of their Wits;

They ſeek to deſtroy our Religion and King,

And all the three Nations to ruine to bring:

But God in his mercy, doth croſs their Deſigns,

And all their Conſpiracies ſtill Countermines.

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

Here's Ireland, Pickering, and Grove to make three,

Who have been all Brothers in iniquity;

Are now come to anſwer for all their foul Crimes,

Which they have been plotting this juncture of times.

Their hidden deſigns they are all come to light,

And now to the World they muſt bid a Good-night.

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

This preſent December, the ſeventeenth day,

Theſe three grand contrivers were brought all away;

Vnto the Old-Baily, where Iuſtice remain'd.

[...]

Such Evidence plainly againſt them appear'd,

As made them deſpair of all hopes to be clear'd.

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

'Twas prov'd they conſpired to Murder our King,

And Popery into the Land for to bring;

To alter the Laws, and to make themſelves great,

And to our Religion, to give the Defeat:

All this was atteſted by Evidence clear,

Which unto the Iury moſt plain did appear;

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

For which horrid Crimes they were guilty brought in,

And then to give Sentence the Iudge did begin,

that they ſhould return to the place whence they came,

A place of great Note, which is Newgate by name;

From thence unto Tiburn be drawn on a Sled;

Firſt hang'd, & then Quartered before they were dead:

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

[...]

### 1.2. The ſecond Part,

To the ſame Tune.

This Sentence of Horror upon them did fall,

Who would have brought ruine and woe to us all,

And now to prepare for their end they retire,

Who were ſo inclined to Blood and to Fire:

Some more of their Gang are put off for a time,

Who likewiſe concerned are, in the ſame Crime:

Then Plotter who Act for old Nick and the Pope,

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

But now came the Day for to finiſh their Doom,

Where with a ſtrong Guard they to Tiburn did come;

With hearts full of ſorrow, though laden with guilt,

For that the foundation was fallen which they built:

As for their Confeſſions but little they ſaid,

Their Crimes to their conſciences cloſely were laid:

Then Plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

Not all the Popes Maſſes theſe Traytors could ſave,

Nor Irelands Bull, that could Iuſtice out-brave;

Nor Grove, his Evaſions avail'd not a whit,

For now unto Fate they are forc'd to ſubmit:

They that did expect to ſee other men fall,

Are now by their King-leaders brought into thrall;

Then plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

And thus our grand Foes, that for miſchief do watch,

will all by degrees, come ſhake hands with Jack Ketch

Have patience, and time will bring all unto light,

That they are contriving, though dark as the night:

They ſtrive but in vain againſt God that's on high,

Beholding their Plots with an All-ſeeing eye:

Then plotters who Act for old Nick and the Pope

You ſee at the laſt you may ſwing in a rope.

Then let all Romes Agents deſpair for to ſee,

Our Nation ſubmit unto their Tyranny;

Their Prieſts and their Ieſuits may pack away,

For here they will find it too hot for to ſtay:

God bleſs our good King, and his Counſel preſerve,

That from true Religion they never may ſerve,

And let thoſe who Act for old Nick and the pope,

At laſt come to Tiburn and ſwing in a rope.

FINIS.
