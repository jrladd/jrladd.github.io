INFINITIE of WORLDS! A thing monstrous if assented to, and to be start­led at, especially by them, whose thoughts this one have alwayes so engaged, that they can find no leisure to think of any thing else. But I onely make a bare proposall to more acute judge­ments, of what my sportfull fancie, with pleasure hath sug­gested: following my old designe of furnishing mens minds with varietie of apprehensions concerning the most weigh­tie points of Philosophie, that they may not seem rashly to have settled in the truth, though it be the truth: a thing as ill beseeming Philosophers, as hastie prejudicative sentence Po­liticall Iudges. But if I had relinquishd here my wonted self, in proving Dogmaticall, I should have found very noble Patro­nage for the cause among the ancients,</span> Epicurus, Democritus, Lucretius, &amp;c. <span class="hi">Or if justice may reach the dead, do them the right, as to shew, that though they be hooted at, by the Rout of the learned, as men of monstrous conceits, they were either ve­ry wise or exceeding fortunate to light on so probable and speci­ous an opinion, in which notwithstanding there is so much dis­ficultie and seeming inconsistencie.</span></p><p><span class="hi">Nay and that sublime and subtil Mechanick too,</span> Des-Chartes, <span class="hi">though he seem to mince it must hold infinitude of worlds, or which is as harsh one infinite one For what is his</span> mundus indefinitè extensus, <span class="hi">but</span> extensus infinitè? <span class="hi">Else it sounds onely</span> infinitus quoad nos <span class="hi">but</span> simpliciter finitus. <span class="hi">But if any space be left out unstuffd with Atoms, it will hazard the dissipation of the whole frame of Nature into disjoynted dust.

And therefore without all remorse lay batterie against mine own edifice: not sparing to shew how weak that is, that my self now deems not impregnably strong. I have at the latter end of the last Canto of</span> Psychathanasia, <span class="hi">not without triumph concluded, that the world hath not continued</span> ab aeterno, <span class="hi">from this ground:</span> </p><div class="q"><div class="l">—Extension</div> <div class="l">That's infinite implies a contradiction.</div></div><p> <span class="hi">And this is in answer to an objection against my last argument of the souls Immortalitie,</span> viz. <span class="hi">divine goodnesse. Which I there make the measure of his providence. That ground limits the essence of the world as well as its duration, and satisfies the curiositie of the Opposer, by shewing the incompossibilitie in the Creature, not want of goodnesse in the Creatour to have staid the framing of the Universe. But now roused up by a new Pbilosophick furie, I answer that difficultie by taking away the Hypothesis of either the world or time being finite: defending the infinitude of both. Which though I had done with a great deal of vigour and life, and semblance of assent, it would have agreed well enough with the free heat of Poefie, and might have passed for a pleasant flourish: but the severitie of my own judgement, and sad Genius hath cast in many correctives and coolers into the Canto it self; so that it cannot amount to more then a discussion. And discussion is no prejudice but an honour to the truth: for then and never but then is she Victorious. And what a glorious Trophee shall the finite world erect when it hath vanquished the Infinite; a Pygmee a Giant.</span></p><p><span class="hi">For the better understanding of the connexion of this Ap­pendix, with the Poem of the souls Immortalitie; I have ta­ken off the last stanza's thereof, and added some few new ones to them for a more easie and naturall leading to the present Can­to.</span> Psychathan. lib. 3.
