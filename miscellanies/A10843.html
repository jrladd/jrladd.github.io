But God forbid. My desire is rather to pacify, then further to alienate affections: remembring Christs instruction vnto his Disciples, to <span class="hi">blesse those</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note7">Math. 44.</span> <span class="hi">that curse them: to do good to those that harm them: &amp; to pray for those that persequute them.</span> Besides, in following their course, I should for the faults of a few corrupter persons, wrong the credits of many honest, &amp; innocent men: for whose sakes I would rayther cover the others faylings, then for them, blemish the credit of the rest. But herein speciall respect is to be had to the common truthes of the Lord Iesus by them &amp; vs, acknowledged: vppon the honour whereof had they been but half so bent, as vppon our disgrace, they would not thus have gratifyed the common adversaryes thereof, even theirs, &amp; ours: &amp; with them, the Atheists &amp; Epicures in the land; by whom their book is most affected: blessing themselves in their professed contempt of God, &amp; of all religion, by the faylings of those (whether truely, or falsely suggested, they regarde not) who professe his more speciall fear, &amp; service: &amp; concludeing, that all others are as ill as themselves, though more covertly. It is the spiders disposition, so she may entangle the silly flyes in her web, to weav out her own bowels.</p><p>This libell it hath pleased divers persons of note for learning, &amp; Zeal, to countenance with their wryteings of divers kyndes. Amongst the rest, M<sup>r</sup> W: Ames, fearing be­like, lest eyther it should want credit, or I discredit by the accusations in it against the per­sons of other men in other Churches (which though they were all true, as I know some of them to be wholy false, &amp; others impudently published by such as were themselves cheif agents in them, yet did no more concern me, &amp; the Church with me, then did the abu­ses in the Ch: of Corinth, the Ch: at Rome; or those in some of the 7 Churches in Asia, the rest, which were free from them) hath published to the world, in the body of that book, without my consent, privity, or least suspition of such dealing, certayn private <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e244"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5430&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> letters passing between him, and me, about private communion betwixt the members of the true visible Ch: and others, though he take advantage, and occasion by certain gene­rall wordes of myne to alter the state ef the question. The occasion of which passages if I should also publish, I am sure he would not like it, nor had cause.</p><p>Now as I neyther am, nor would he thought in sensible of this vnchristian enmity, and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note8"><span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span></span> violent opposition by them against vs in the practise of those things, which themselves, as their wryteings testify, do so far approve; so think I it a Preface very convenions for my present purpose, to communicate with others such grounds, as vppon which they seem to rayse the same.</p><p>And first, all oppositions in religion are caryed vsually with violence, as wherein men have speciall perswasion they please God, in that their speciall work of Conscience and Zeal for him, and his truth. And as men are in daunger to mistake errour for truth, so to prosequute the same with wrath, and indignation, instead of true Zeal of God. And I do much entreat, &amp; warn those men in the fear of the Lord, to beware that in-stead of Zeal against our supposed errours, they nourish not in their hearts, wrath, and hatred against<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note9"><span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span></span> our persons. Which is a great iniquity where it is found, and most contrary vnto love, and so vnto <span class="hi">God who is love;</span> &amp; the breaking of <span class="hi">the whole law,</span> which <span class="hi">love fulfilleth.</span></p><p>But besides this generall, they take more speciall occasion of offence at vs, &amp; our sepa­ration, by which we cary our differences; as wherein we do not onely in word, but even really &amp; indeed reprove their state, &amp; standing, as vnlawfull: &amp; such, as we rayther chuse all calamityes, by losse of country, freinds, riches, credit, liberty, yea &amp; life is self, then by continuance therein, to <span class="hi">withould the truth of God in vnrighteous­nes,</span> &amp; vphould the chayr of Apostacy, and so to pull down wrath from heaven vppon our heades. Which our sequestration is yet the more offensive vnto them, by how much the nearer we were, &amp; yet are, in many things, vnited: the <span class="hi">contentions of brethren being as the barres of a castle:</span> as also for that their party for the reformation of<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note10"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ov. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. 19.</span> their pretended nationall <span class="hi">Iudah</span> is thereby weakened. And as any (accordeing to the proverb) may easily fynde a staffe, to beat a dog withall, so do men easily take occasion to lay load vppon vs, who are for our fewnes in number, &amp; mean-nes of condition, so con­temptible in their eyes: &amp; against whom they have all advantages for treading vppon vs (save the truth) which they can desire. But the L: Iesus in teaching, that <span class="hi">the way to life is narrow, which few fynde:</span> &amp; that to <span class="hi">the pore the gospell is preached,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note11"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ath. 7. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. 11. <span class="hi">&amp;</span> 6.</span> &amp; therevppon, that <span class="hi">he is blessed who is not offended at him,</span> doth plainly fore­warn all his servants of this offence.

So if, on the contrary it come to passe, thorough her craft, &amp; cruelty, &amp; theyr own weaknes (which is too too common also) that godly, &amp; fayth­full persons be in the false Church where they should not be, shall we now lay vppon theyr persons all the curses, &amp; condemnation, which the Scrip­tures denounce agaynst the estate of the false Church, &amp; the superstitions thereof? were not this to <span class="hi">iustify the wicked,</span> because he is in the true Church: where he should not be? &amp; <span class="hi">to condemn the righteouse</span> because he is in the false Church, where he should not be neyther?

Otherwise our iudgment wilbe as confused, as is theyr estate.

In receaving an admonition from an vnlawfull brother, (as they speak) I do submit onely to that which is good in it self, &amp; of God: but in submitting to an vnlawfull Officer, Prelate or Preist, I submit to that which is evill in it self &amp; not of God, to wit, his very Office, or Order. The vnlawfull brother, though in sin, yet doth not perform the admoni­tion by vertue of his sin, but out of his personall knowledg, &amp; Zeal (at least in appearance) agaynst the sin he reproves in particular, but the vn­lawfull Officer doth administer the publique doctrine, (as the Sacraments) by vertue, or rayther by vice, of his very sin immediately, &amp; properly: wherein I may not pertake with him. These men have refused to submit to <span class="hi">M<sup>r</sup> Iohnsons</span> publique Ministery, &amp; so professe: do they therfore think it Vnlawfull to receav any information, or admonition, or reproof by the word of God for their sins, from him, or any the people with him priva­tely, &amp; vppon occasion? And by their larg grounds it should be lawfull to submit to the ministery of any hereticall Minister: for from such a one it is not vnlawfull to receav a private admonition for sin, vppon occasion. But how much better were it for these men, &amp; their freinds to advance by all good means a lawfull Ministery, then thus to supporte that which is vn­lawfull, by pleading for submission vnto it. But if they needs will, (as they plead in their book submit their soules to <span class="hi">theeves, &amp; robbers,</span> &amp; to such Ministers, as were the <span class="hi">Scribes,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Pharisees</span> in Christes tyme, (in whom they instance) notorious Heretiques denying both the nature, Offices, &amp; Person of the Messiah, teaching iustification by the works of the law, &amp; power in man to keep it, let them <span class="hi">reioyce</span> in their Mi­nisters, &amp; let their Ministers <span class="hi">also reioyce</span> in them, as <span class="hi">Iotham</span> sayd of <span class="hi">the men of Schechem,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Abimelech:</span> but for vs, we have learnt to give more honour to Gods ordinance, &amp; to have more care of Christs pre­tious purchase, our souls, then to commit the same to such watch­mens keeping.</p><p>Thus have I breifly noted down, &amp; confirmed the principall grounds of our separation from the Communion, &amp; order of the Ch: assemblyes, notwithstanding the admission of the personall communion before men­tioned.

There is hence more colour for that, then that they shall not be baptized because they beleev not: for Christ sayth not, <span class="hi">he that beleeves not,</span> shall not be bap­tized, but <span class="hi">shalbe damned.</span> The thing then is: Christ neyther excludes the children of beleevers from baptism, nor from salvation, for want of fayth, but vnbeleevers, &amp; such as refuse the gospell from both.

The same confide­rations are to be had of the L: Supper.

And if the new Covenant or Testament consist so much in baptism, as these men think, then could not Adam, &amp; Abraham, &amp; other the holy Patriar­kes, &amp; Prophets vnbaptized, have been within the compasse of the Cove­nant, &amp; promise of grace, or have had their partes in the Testament of Christ, the promised seed.

This he proves by the Covenant made with Abraham, &amp; with every faythfull sonne, &amp; daughter of Abraham, that he wilbe the God of his, or her seed: &amp; so en­dow them with the holines of the Covenant: &amp; that therefore they should not make scruple of liveing with their (though vnbeleeveing, if otherwise lawfull) wives, &amp; hous bands. And in this interpretation is force of Ar­gument, both for the Apostles meaning, &amp; Corinth: satisfaction.

And straung it is for this man to make it all one, to be saved, &amp; to be of the visible Church; &amp; to be condemned, &amp; to be out of it, specially for children; since he will have them all saved, &amp; yet none of them at all to be of the Church. 2. if he were <span class="hi">assured,</span> as he sayth, that we would <span class="hi">confesse, that no parents do confer grace by generation more then others,</span> I am assured he shewed the lesse grace, in accuseing vs in another place agaynst his conscience, to <span class="hi">hould that Christians beget Christians by genera­tion.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note484">Pag. 172</span> 3.

Since then all men are not in Christ, &amp; so not partakers of the grace of God in him: nor yet, if they were, could a common, vniversall, &amp; equall grace make them vnequall, who were formerly equall, it followeth that there is a speciall, &amp; peculiar grace, which God in Christ giveth vnto some, &amp; not to others: by which they are enabled to vnderstand, &amp; beleev the Gospell, &amp; to repent: &amp; so by consequence, a speciall, &amp; particular election of those persons before the world: since <span class="hi">Gods workes are known vnto him of ould:</span> ney­ther<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note487">Act. 15. 8</span> doth he any thing in tyme, which he did not purpose to do before tyme.</p><p>Lastly since <span class="hi">all</span> children are <span class="hi">by nature children of,</span> or subiect to <span class="hi">wrath,</span> &amp; which God might in iustice destroy, why should it seem harsh vnto these men, that he should exequute his iustice vppon some, &amp; shew mercy vppon others, &amp; save them?

This man by one, &amp; the same errour, which is the perverting, &amp; misapplying of the Scriptures to infants, which are pe­culiar to men of years, debars them of both.</p><p>These things considered, I hope it will appear to the godly, &amp; wise rea­der, that the things for which he chalengeth me in this (as in other poynts) are onely <span class="hi">false,</span> wherein they are by him falsifyed.

And this I note for two purposes. First that we may know that the condemnation of wicked men by God, for sin by their freewill to be wrought, was purposed of God before the world: it beinge a good worke of God, &amp; effected by his infinite power for the holynes, &amp; glory of his iu­stice: 2<sup>dly</sup>, that since <span class="hi">every good geveing, &amp; every perfect gift is from above aescen­ding</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note497">Iam. 1. 1</span> <span class="hi">from the father of lightes,</span> &amp; that, to know God, to beleve in him, to love, &amp; obay him, to <span class="hi">receive</span> Christ, &amp; the Gospel of salvation offered, are the good giftes of God, we may also know, that God not onely foresees, that those graces will be in men, but also fore purposes frō eternity himselfe to worke, &amp; effect them: that if any should tell vs (as many do) that God hath in­deed predestinated such men vnto salvation, as he foresaw would beleve in Christ, &amp; receive the grace in him offered, we may answer them, that God foresees indeed those graces in those men, but it is because he fore purpo­seth to work them. He workes them in tyme, because of his free grace he purposed to worke them before tyme was: without which his purpose, he could not have foreseen them. And as the Lord in the begining <span class="hi">saw</span> that the things <span class="hi">he had made were all good</span> when he had made them such: so did he foresee all other good graces in men, because he forepurposed so to worke &amp; effect them.</p><p>The begining &amp; end of the 10<sup>th</sup> Position: viz: <span class="hi">That God is not the Au­thour,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note498">10 Co<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>clusion</span> <span class="hi">or worker of sin: &amp; that he geves no influence, instinct, motion, or inclinatten to the least sin,</span> I embrace: But the middle parte thereof, viz: <span class="hi">That God one­ly did foresee, &amp; determyne what evill the free will of men, &amp; Angels would do,</span> I except against, as derogatory to the infinitenes of Gods power, &amp; wisdom: neyther indeed is it senseible to say, that God determyned, what the will of others would do.</p><p>But what the forethoughtes &amp; purposes of God have been from eter­nity about sin (so far as the knowledge thereof concerneth vs) will best appear, if we consider, what the worke of his providence is, in, &amp; about it in tyme, &amp; when it is wrought by men, or Angels.</p><p>And first since sin is the worke of men &amp; Angels, it followeth that sin is from them, who are themselves from God: though the si<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> be not, but of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16598"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5430&amp;page=56">[Page 102]</a></span> themselves: yea not onely the natures, &amp; persons, but even the naturall powers, faculties, and instruments together with their naturall motions, &amp; actions, in, &amp; by which sin is wrought, are of God also: by him susteyned, &amp; vpheld, &amp; acted by his almighty power, which is the cause of every crea­ture,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note499">Act 17. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>1.</span> &amp; vpholdeth all things, &amp; so of every action, as an action: Sin not be­ing created of God, not any part or power of man, or Angel, nor any mo­tion,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note500">Rom. 11. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>6.</span> or action, but onely the depravation, corruption, crooked &amp; inordi­nate abuse &amp; application of the same created part, power, or motion.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note501">Colle. 1. 7.</span> For example: the very power, &amp; vse of seeing the forbidden fruit,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note502"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ob. 1. 3.</span> the naturall desire of it, as a pleasant thing, the power &amp; ability of taking, as also of eating it, were of God in themselves: But the sin stood in the inordinate­nes, &amp; abuse of the sence, appetite, &amp; power vppon that, which was forbid­den by God.

I answer that the threatning was legall, &amp; according to the course of iustice, and therefore did not hinder but God in mercy might fynde a remedy, as he also did: &amp; so the L: meaning was no more, but that in the day wherein <span class="hi">Adam</span> ate, he should be subject to, &amp; guilty of death, &amp; the curse of God.

The truth then is, that God threatned not onely spirituall, and eternall death (which is the consumma­tion of the former) but bodily also, &amp; with it, all bodily, &amp; temporary ca­lamityes leading vnto it.

But here is the difference, that the same na­turall power of freewill, which before, was rightly ordered, &amp; disposed one­ly to good actually, (though changeably) was afterwards corrupted, disor­dered &amp; clean cōtrarily disposed, till by supernaturall grace it was rectifyed, &amp; renued. It is true then, that sin destroyeth not the naturall powers, or parts of soul, or body, but onely corrupteth, infecteth, &amp; disordereth them: whence also ariseth in the mynde, ignorance, errour, doubtinges, &amp; vnbe­leef; &amp; in the will, &amp; affections, perversnes, &amp; disorder, with manifold lusts, to the fullfilling &amp; execution whereof, the bodily instruments are di­sposed. But the reason brought, <span class="hi">that sin can not abolish Gods work, or Creatures,</span> is frivolous: For God suffering sin to enter, suffereth therein an abolition of his own work &amp; creature. It is confessed, Propos: 11. <span class="hi">That Adam sinning, dyed the death, &amp; lost innocency, peace of Conscience, &amp; the comfortable presence of God.</span> Now was not this spirituall death which Adam dyed, an abolition, &amp; de­struction of his spirituall life, innocency, &amp;c: works of God, &amp; his creatu­res? the same may be sayd of the whole Image of God. What were these but workes of God, creatures, &amp; created graces, &amp; endowments, wrought in him, &amp; bestowed on him by the hand of the Creatour, which sin abolished both in him, &amp; in his posterity by naturall propagation? as will appear in the refutation of the 18<sup>th</sup> Conclusions: which is,</p><p>That Originall sin is an idle term, &amp; that there is no such thing as men intend by<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note525"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> 8 Con­clusion.</span> the word. <span class="hi">Eze:</span> 18. 20.

Yet is the ground good being rightly layd (vnto which that also Conclus: 73. is agreable, though the Scriptures be brought hand over head to confirm it.) For as God by promising Abraham that he would be his <span class="hi">God, &amp; the God of his seed,</span> preach­ed to his ear, so by giveing him, &amp; his seed circumcision, he preached to his ey, for the ratification of the same promise.

And whereas the Church, and new creature are opposed, it is amisse, since the Church is to consist onely of such men as are in their measure renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctifyed: and if by the <span class="hi">new creature</span> they mean any other thing, it is a <span class="hi">new creature</span> of their own makeing.</p><p>In Conclus: 83. <span class="hi">Where the office of the magistrate,</span> is called a <span class="hi">permissive ordi­nance</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note651"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>3 Con­clusion.</span> <span class="hi">of God,</span> is both a contradiction, and evill <span class="hi">speakeing of them in authoritie.</span> Where it is called <span class="hi">an ordinance of God,</span> it is confessed good, for <span class="hi">every creature of God is good,</span> and all his ordinances are his creatures; and so, many things are ascribed to the office of Magistrates in this, and the other Conclus: about it, which prove it to be good, and lawfull in it self: but where it is made <span class="hi">per­missive,</span> it is condemned as evill: since onely evill is permitted, or suffered of God.</p><p>And where it is objected Prop: 85. <span class="hi">that Christs Disciples must love their enemyes, &amp; not kill them: pray for them, &amp; not punish them,</span> &amp;c.

Doth not God punish with tempora­ry death those that he loveth? and why may not Gods deputyes, the <span class="hi">Gods</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note652">Psal. 82. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 6.</span> vppon earth, be mynded as God herein? When the godly Kings, and go­vernours in Israel were commaunded to exequute judgment and iustice vp­pon the people for their transgressions, were they commaunded not to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e20229"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5430&amp;page=69">[Page 129]</a></span> love them, &amp; not to pray for them? When <span class="hi">Mr Smith</span> in his sicknes, tels his children (as it is in the end of the booke) <span class="hi">that if he live, he must correct, &amp; be at them, not because he hates them, but because he loves them, as God did him,</span> doth he not answer the objection, &amp; shew the those two may well stand together, as in the private father, so in the publique father, the Magistrate? Where agayn it is sayd that <span class="hi">Christs Disciples must with him be persequuted, afflicted, mur­dered</span> &amp;c: <span class="hi">&amp; that by the authority of the Magistrate.</span> I do answer; that those things are not simply necessary for all persons, but as God calles men vnto them. And 2. both the Scriptures, &amp; other Stories do testify that godly Magistrates themselves, have suffered these thinges for the Lord &amp; his trueth, &amp; for well doeing: sometymes the inferiour Magistrates, by the Superiour, &amp; sometymes the Governours by the people vnder them.

And much it is that these men should acknowledg that Magistrates are to be prayed for, &amp; geven thanks for, as the Scriptures teach. 1.

Doth any good<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note655">1.

Surely even as lawfully as to be receaved in for evill doeing. They ad <span class="hi">that the Magistrate is not to medle with religion, or matters of conscience, nor to compell men to this, or that forme of religion, because</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note657">Ioh. 7. 82 Tit. 1. 5</span> <span class="hi">Christ is the King, &amp; lawgiver of the Church &amp; conscience.</span> Iam: 4. 12. I answer that this indeed proves that he may alter, devise, or establish nothing in re­ligion otherwise then Christ hath appoynted, but proves not, that he may not vse his lawfull power lawfully for the furtherance of Christs Kingdom &amp; lawes. The Prophet Isaias speakeing of the Church of Christ, foretels <span class="hi">that Kings shalbe her noursing fathers, &amp; Queens her noursing mothers:</span> which if they medle not with her, how can they be?

Which course when doubtfull differences of weight do arise, the members of the Church ought to take, &amp; so to rest in their equall determinations. But what if none of the Chuch can sufficiently iudg of the things: or setle them in peace for after posteritie? (as it may well come to passe in cases of inheri­tance especially) the matter may &amp; ought quietly, &amp; peaceably to be re­ferred to the Magistrates determination.
