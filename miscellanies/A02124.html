But this griefe ſo galled his conſcience, and this curſed care ſo cumbred his minde, that his happi­neſſe was greatly ſurcharged with heauineſſe, to ſée the cauſe of his care could by no meanes be cured. For this <span class="hi">Clerophontes,</span> was indued with two children, the one a daughter named <span class="hi">Lewcippa,</span> and the other a ſonne called <span class="hi">Gwydonius:</span> this <span class="hi">Lewcippa,</span> was ſo perfect in the com­plexion <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e474"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> of her bodie, and ſo pure in the conſtitution of her minde, ſo adorned with outward beautie, and endued with inward bountie, ſo poliſhed with rare vertues and exqui­ſite qualities, as ſhée ſéemed a ſéemly <span class="hi">Venus</span> for her beauty, and a ſecond <span class="hi">Veſta,</span> for her virginite: yea, Nature and the gods had ſo beuntifully beſtowed their gifts vpon her, as ſame herſelfe was doubtful whether ſhe ſhould make grea­ter report of her excellent vertue, or exquiſite beautie. But his ſonne <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> was ſo contrarie to his ſiſter <span class="hi">Lew­cippa,</span> (though not in the ſtate of his bodie, yet in the ſtaie of his mind) as it made al men maruaile how two ſuch con­trarie ſtemmes could ſpring out of the ſelf ſame ſtock: His perſonage indéed was ſo comely, his feature ſo wel framed, each limb ſo perfectly couched, his face ſo fair, and his coun­tenance ſo amiable, as he ſéemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcaſſe.</p><p>But his minde was ſo blemiſhed with deteſtable quali­ties, and ſo ſpotted with the ſtaine of voluptuouſneſſe, that hee was not ſomuch to bee commended for the proporti­on of his bodie, as to bee condemned for the imperfecti­on of his minde. Hee was ſo endued with vanitie, and ſo imbrued with vice, ſo nurſed vp in wantonneſſe, and ſo nulled vp in wilfulneſſe, ſo careleſſe to obſerue his fathers commaund, and ſo retchleſſe to regard his counſell, that neither the dread of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fathers diſpleaſure, coulde driue him to deſiſt from his deteſtable kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact ſo filchy, which hée would not commit, no miſchiefe ſo monſtrous, which hée would not enterprſſe: no danger ſo deſperate, which hée woulde not aduenture: no perill ſo fearefull, which hée would not performe: nor no action ſo diueliſh, which hée would not execute. So immodeſt in his manners, ſo rude in his geſtures, yea and ſo prodigall in his expences, as mines of golde were not able to maintaine ſuch witleſſe prodigalitie. This loathſom life of <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> was ſuch a cutting coraſiue to his Fathers carefull conſcience, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e510"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> and ſuch a hapleſſe clog to his heauic hart, that no ioy could make him enioy any ioy, no mirth could make him merry, no proſperity could make him pleaſant: but abandoning all delight, &amp; auoiding all companie, he ſpent his doleful daies in dumps and dolors, which he vttered in theſe words.</p><p>NOw (quoth hée) I proue by experience, the ſaying of <span class="hi">Sophocles</span> to be true, that the man which hath many children ſhall neuer liue without ſome mirth, nor die with­out ſome ſorrow: for if they be vertuous, he ſhal haue cauſe whereof to reioyce, if vicious, wherefore to be ſad: which ſaying I trie performed in myſelfe: for as I haue one child which delights me with her vertue, ſo I haue another that deſpights me with his vanity, as the one by dutie brings me ioy, ſo the other by diſobedience bréeds my anoy: yea as the one is a comfort to my minde, ſo the other is a fretting coraſiue to my heart: for what griefe is there more griping, what pain more pinching, what croſſe more comberſome, what plagne more pernitious, yea, what trouble can tor­ment me worle, then to ſée my ſonne, mine heir, the inheritor of my Dukedom, which ſhould be the pillex of my paren­tage, to conſume his time in royſting and ryot, in ſpending and ſpoiling, in ſwearing and ſwaſhing, &amp; in following wil­fully the furie of his own frantike fancie. Alas, moſt miſe­rable and lamentable caſe, would to God the deſtinies had decreed his death in the ſwadling cloutes, or that the fates had preſcribed his death in his infancie. Oh that the daie of his birth had béen the daie of his buriall, or that by ſome ſiniſter ſtorme of fortune he had béen ſtifled on his mothers knées, ſo that his vntimely death might haue preuented my enſuing ſorrowes, and his future calamities: for I ſie that the young frie will alwaies proue olde frogs, that the croo­ked twig will proue a crabbed trée, that the ſower bud will neuer be ſwéet bloſſome, how that which is bred in the bone will not eaſily out of the fleſh, that he which is careleſſe in youth, will be leſſe carefull in age, that where in prime of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e530"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> yéeres vice raigneth, there in ripe age vanity remaineth. Why <span class="hi">Clerophontes,</span> if thou ſéeſt the ſore, why doeſt thou not apply the ſalue? and if thou doeſt perceiue the miſchief, why dooſt not preuent it with medicine? take away the cauſe &amp; the effect faileth: if <span class="hi">Gwydonius</span> be the cauſe of thy ruth, cut him off betimes, leaſt hee bring thee to ruine: better hadſt thou want a Son then neuer want ſorrow. Perhaps thou wilt ſuffer him ſo long, til he fall ſick of the Father, and then hée wil not only ſéek thy lands and liuing, but life and all, if thou preuent not his purpoſe: yea, and after thy death he will be through his laſciuious life the ouer throw of thy houſe, the conſumer of thy Dukedome, the wracke of thy Common­weale, and the very man that ſhall bring the ſtate of <span class="hi">Mity­lene</span> to miſchief &amp; miſerie. Sith then thy Son is ſuch a ſink of ſorrowes, in whoſe life lies hid a loathſome maſſe of wret­ched miſhaps, cut him off as a graceleſſe graft, vnworthy to grow out of ſuch a ſtock. Alas <span class="hi">Clerophontes,</span> ſhalt thou be ſo vnnaturall as to ſeek the ſpoile of thine owne childe, wilt thou bee more ſauage then the brute Beaſtes in com­mitting ſuch crueltie? no, alas, the leaſt miſfortune of our children dooth ſo mooue vs, that as the Spider féeleth if her web bee prickt but with the point of a pinne, ſo if they bée toucht but with the leaſt trouble, we féele the paines there­of with pricking grief to pinch vs. Why hath not Nature then cauſed loue to aſcend as well as to deſcend, and placed as dutifull obedience in the childe, as louing affection in the father: and with that he fetcht ſuch a deep ſigh, that it was a ſigne of the extreame ſorrowe he conceiued for his ſonnes witleſſe folly. But as hée was readie againe to enter into his dolefull diſcourſe, to aggranate his griefe the more, and increaſe his care, certaine complaints were brought him by ſundry Citizens, of the outragious behauiour of his Sonne <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> which béeing attentiuely heard he in great choller called for his ſonne, againſt whom hée thun­dred out ſuch threatning reproaches, laying before his face the miſery that would enſue of ſuch reckleſſe miſchiefes, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e561"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> and promiſing that if hee directed not his courſe by a new compaſſe, and leuelled his life by a new line, hee would not onely repay his folly with the penalty of the law, but alſo by conſent of his commons, diſinherite him of his Duke­dome: that <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> greatly incenſed with the ſeuere cenſure of his father, broyling with furious rage, ſturdily burſt forth into theſe ſtubborne tearmes.</p><p>SIr, (quoth hée) if <span class="hi">Terence</span> his <span class="hi">Menedemus</span> were aliue, and heard theſe your fond and fantaſticall reaſons, hee would as readily condemn you of crabbedneſſe, as he accu­ſed <span class="hi">Chremes</span> of curriſhneſſe: for as he by too much auſte­ritie procured his ſonnes miſhap, ſo you by too much ſeue­ritie ſéeke to bréed my miſfortune. You olde men moſt in­iuſtly, or rather iniuriouſly, meaſure our ſtayleſſe moode by your ſtayed minds, our yoong yeares by your hoary haires, our floriſhing youth by your withered age, thinking to di­rect our doings by your doatings, our wils by your wits, our youthfull fancies by your aged affections, &amp; to quench our fierie flames by your dead coales and cinders: yea, ſup­poſing that the Leueret ſhould be as skilfull in making of a head, as the olde Hare, that the yoong Cubs ſhould aſſoon tapiſh, as the old Fox, that the yoong Frie ſhould as well auoid the net as the old Fiſh, and that the yoong wantons ſhould be as warie as the olde wiſards. But this ſir, is to make fire froſt, to chaunge heate to colde, mirth to mour­ning, ſinging to ſadneſſe, pleaſure to paine, and to tye the Ape and the Bear in one tedder. Sith then young ſtemmes will not bee ſet on a withered ſtocke, that the yoong twig lieth not vnder y<sup>e</sup> old trée, that the toyiſh conceits of youth are vnfit for the teſtie cogitations of age: I mean for your ſatiſfaction and my ſolace, to depart fram the Court, and to ſpend my dayes in trauell.</p><p><span class="hi">Clerophontes</span> no ſooner heard this determination of his ſonne <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> but his ſorrowe was halfe ſalued, and his care almoſt cured, thinking that by trauell hée <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e605"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> ſhould eyther end his life, or amend his lewdneſſe, &amp; there­fore both heartned and haſtened his ſonne in this his new courſe, leaſt delay might bréed danger, or time by ſome toy cauſe him turn his tippet, furniſhing &amp; finiſhing all things neceſſarie for his ſonnes iournie: who readie to goe (more willing to trauell, than his father to intreate him) had this friendly farewell giuen him by <span class="hi">Clerophontes.</span></p><p>SOnne (quoth hee) there is no greater doubt which doth more déeply diſtreſſe the minde of a young man, then to determine with himſelfe what courſe of life is beſt to take: for there is ſuch a confuſed <span class="hi">Chaos</span> of contrarie conceits in yong wits, that whiles they look for that they cannot like, they are loſt in ſuch an endleſſe labyrinth, as neither choice nor chance can drawe them out to their wiſhed deſires: for ſo many vaines ſo manie vanities: if vertue draweth one way, vice driueth another way: as profit perſwades them, ſo pleaſure prouokes them: as wit weigheth, will wre­ſteth, if friendes counſell them to take this, fancie forceth them to chooſe that: ſo that deſire ſo long hanges in doubt, as either they chooſe none, or elſe chance on the worſt. But in my opinion, the fitteſt kind of life for a young gentleman to take (who as yet hath not ſubdued the youthfull conceits of fancie, nor made a conqueſt of his wil by wit) is to ſpend his time in trauell, whearin hee ſhall finde both pleaſure and profite: yea, and buy that by experience, which o­therwiſe with all the treaſure in the world he cannot pur­chaſe. For what changeth vanity to vertue, ſtayleſſe wit to ſtayed wiſedome, fond fantaſies to firme affections, but trauell: what repreſſeth the rage of youth, and redreſſeth the witleſſe furie of wanton yéeres, but trauell: what tur­neth a ſecure life to a carefull liuing, what maketh the foo­liſh wiſe, yea, what increaſeth wit and augmenteth skill, but trauell? inſomuch that the fame <span class="hi">Vlyſſes</span> wonne, was not by the tenne yéeres he late at <span class="hi">Troy,</span> but by the time he ſpent in trauell.

In fine, without this Goddeſſe, man ſhoulde bee carefull, heauie, and whollie drowned in ſorrow: whereas Follie quickeneth his ſpirits, maketh him ſing, daunce, leape, and frame himſelfe altogether to pleaſure. It is not poſſible that loue ſhould bee without the daughter of youth, which is Follie. For Loue ſpringeth of ſedaine and ſundrie cauſes, by receiuing an apple, as <span class="hi">Cidippe:</span> by looking out at a windowe, as <span class="hi">Scilla:</span> by reading in a Booke, as the Ladie <span class="hi">Francis Rimhi:</span> ſome fall in loue by ſight, ſome by hearing, but all liuing in hope to obtaine their deſires. And yet ſome haue loued without anie na­turall cauſe, as <span class="hi">Pigmalion,</span> who fell in loue with his Mar­ble picture: and I pray you what <span class="hi">Sympathie</span> could there be betwéene a liuely youth and a dead ſtone? what was it then but follie that kindled this flame? What forced <span class="hi">Nar­ciſſus</span> to fall in loue with his owne ſhaddowe, but Follie? Yea, what aduenture is paſſed in loue without Follie? <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8023"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=74">[Page]</a></span> For the Philoſophers define Follie to be a depriuation of wiſedome, and wiſedome is altogether without paſſions: of the which when loue ſhall be voide, then no doubt, the Sea ſhall be without waues, and the fire without heats.</p><p class="p-in-sp">Conſider but a young man which onely placeth his de­light in amorous conceites, decking, dreſſing, and perfu­ming himſelfe moſt delicately, who paſſeth out of his lod­ging fraught with a thouſand ſundrie fancies, accompani­ed with men and Pages, paſſing to the place where hee may haue a ſight of his Miſtreſſe, obtaining for his trauell no gaine but perhaps ſome amorous glance, making long ſutes, ſpending his time and his treaſure, conſuming his wit, and waſting his wealth, and yet reaping nothing but diſdaine and diſcredite. But if it chance that his Miſtreſſe condeſcend vnto his requeſts, ſhe appointeth him to come at ſome ſuſpicious houre, which he cannot performe with­out great perill. To come with company, were to bewraie his ſecrets: to go alone, moſt daungerous: to goe openly, too manifeſt: ſo that he muſt paſſe diſguiſed, ſometime like a woman, other times like a peaſant or ſome vile perſon, ſcaling the walles with ladders, climbing vp to the win­dowes by cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follie did not hold him vp by the hand. It is not alſo vn­knowne vnto you how many ſundrie paſſions do perplexe the poore paſſionate Louers, all which procéed of Follie: as to haue ones heart ſeparated from himſelfe, to be now in peace and then in warre, now couering his dolour, blu­ſhing one while, and looking pale another, fraught whollie with feare, hope, &amp; ſhame, ſeeking that carefully which hée ſéemeth to flie, and yet doubtfully dreading not to finde it, to laugh ſildome, to ſigh often, to burne in colde, and freeze in heate, to be croſſed altogether with contraries, which be ſignes not onely of follie, but of phrenſie. Who ſhall ex­cuſe <span class="hi">Hercules,</span> handling ſo carefully the diſtaſte of <span class="hi">Omphale,</span> or <span class="hi">Salomon</span> for combring himſelfe with ſo many Con­cubines, <span class="hi">Anniball</span> in ſubmitting himſelfe to his Loue, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8061"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=75">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">Ariſtotle</span> in obeying <span class="hi">Hermia,</span> and <span class="hi">Socrates</span> in yéelding to <span class="hi">Aſpaſia,</span> and many other which we ſée daily to bee ſo blin­ded, as they know not themſelues: and what is the cauſe hereof, but follie? ſo that we ſee that it is ſhe which maketh Loue to be ſo feared and redoubted, it is ſhe that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and cauſeth him to be counted as a God. Further, whoſoeuer loueth, muſt apply himſelfe to the affection of his miſtreſſe, although it be contrarie to his naturall conſtitution: if he be quiet, wiſe, and diſcréete, yet if his louer pleaſe to haue him chaunge his ſtate, he muſt turne his ſtearne, and hoiſe his ſaile, to goe with another winde. <span class="hi">Zethius</span> and <span class="hi">Amphion</span> could not agrée, for becauſe the delight of the one was a deſpight to the other, vntill <span class="hi">Amphion</span> left his Muſicke. If the Ladie whom thou lo­ueſt be couetous, thou muſt chaunge thy ſelfe into golde, and ſo fall into her boſome: if ſhe be merrie, thou muſt bée pleaſant: if ſullen, thou muſt be ſad. All the ſeruants and ſutors to Atlanta were hunters, becauſe ſhe delighted in that ſport. Many Gentlewomen to pleaſe their louers which were Poets, left the rocke and the néedle, and tooke in hand pennes &amp; books: now tell mee if theſe ſtraunge Me­tamorphoſes be not méere points of follie? Doe you thinke that a Souldier which goeth to the aſſault, marketh the trenches, thinketh of his enemies, or of a thouſand hargue­buſhes, wherof euerie one is ſufficient to deſtroy him? No, he onely hopeth to win the conqueſt, and doth not ſo much as once imagine the reſt. He which firſt inuented ſayling, doubted not of the perillous daungers: and hee that play­eth, neuer thinketh to become a looſer, yet are they all thrée in daunger to be ſlaine, drowned, and vndone. But what then? they neither do ſee, nor will ſée what is hurtfull vn­to them. So we muſt coniecture the like of louers: for if they did ſée the dreadfull dangers, and the fearefull perits wherein they are, how they be deceiued and beguiled, they would neuer honour loue as God, but deteſt him as a Di­uell, and ſo ſhould the kingdom of loue be deſtroyed, which <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8101"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6139&amp;page=75">[Page]</a></span> now is gouerned by ignorance, careleſneſſe, hope &amp; blinde­neſſe, which are all the handmaids of Folly. Remaine in peace then fond Loue, and ſéeke not to break the auncient league which is betwéen thée and Folly.
