The truth is, I fancied to my self a kind of ease in the change of the Paroxism; never suspecting but that the humour wou'd have wasted it self in two or three Pastorals of <span class="hi">Theocritus,</span> and as many Odes of <span class="hi">Horace.</span> But finding, or at least thinking I found, something that was more pleasing in them, than my ordinary producti­ons, I encourag'd my self to renew my old ac­quaintance with <span class="hi">Lucretius</span> and <span class="hi">Virgil</span>; and im­mediately <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e244"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> fix'd upon some parts of them which had most affected me in the reading. These were my natural Impulses for the undertaking: But there was an accidental motive, which was full as forcible, and God forgive him who was the occasion of it. It was my Lord <span class="hi">Roscomon</span>'s <span class="hi">Essay</span> on translated Verse, whose made me un­easie till I try'd whether or no I was capable of following his Rules, and of reducing the specula­tion into practice. For many a fair Precept in Poetry, is like a seeming Demonstration in the Mathematicks; very specious in the Diagram, but failing in the Mechanick Operation. I think I have generally observ'd his instructions; I am sure my reason is sufficiently convinc'd both of their truth and usefulness; which, in other words, is to confess no less a vanity than to pretend that I have at least in some places made Examples to his Rules. Yet withall, I must acknowledge, that I have many times exceeded my Commission; for I have both added and omitted, and even some­times very boldly made such expositions of my Au­thors, as no <span class="hi">Dutch</span> Commentator will forgive me. Perhaps, in such particular passages, I have <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e264"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> thought that I discover'd some beauty yet undisco­ver'd by those Pedants, which none but a Poet cou'd have found. Where I have taken away some of their Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the <span class="hi">Greek</span> or <span class="hi">Latin,</span> wou'd not appear so shining in the <span class="hi">English</span>: And where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks wou'd not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him: or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an <span class="hi">Englishman,</span> they are such, as he wou'd probably have written.</p><p>For, after all, a Translator is to make his Au­thor appear as charming at possibly he can, pro­vided he maintains his Character, and makes him not unlike himself. Translation is a kind of Drawing after the Life; where every one will acknowledge there is a double sort of likeness, a good one and a bad. 'Tis one thing to draw the Out-lines true, the Features like, the Proportions exact, the Colouring it self perhaps tolerable, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e287"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> another thing to make all these graceful, by the posture, the shadowings, and chiefly by the Spirit which animates the whole. I cannot without some indignation, look on an ill Copy of an excellent Original▪ Much less can I behold with patience <span class="hi">Virgil, Homer,</span> and some others, whose beau­ties I have been endeavouring all my Life to imi­tate, so abus'd, as I may say to their Faces by a botching Interpreter. What <span class="hi">English</span> Readers unacquainted with <span class="hi">Greek</span> or <span class="hi">Latin</span> will believe me or any other Man, when we commend those Authors, and confess we derive all that is par­donable in us from their Fountains, if they take those to be the same Poets, whom our <span class="hi">Ogleby's</span> have Translated? But I dare assure them, that a good Poet is no more like himself, in a dull Translation, than his Carcass would be to his living Body. There are many who understand <span class="hi">Greek</span> and <span class="hi">Latin,</span> and yet are ignorant of their Mo­ther Tongue. The proprieties and delicacies of the <span class="hi">English</span> are known to few; 'tis impossible even for a good Wit, to understand and practice them without the help of a liberal Education, long Reading, and digesting of those few good Au­thors <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e329"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> we have amongst us, the knowledge of Men and Manners, the freedom of habitudes and con­versation with the best company of both Sexes; <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nd in short, without wearing off the ru<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t which <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e contracted, while he was laying in a stock of Learning. Thus difficult it is to understand the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>urity of <span class="hi">English,</span> and critically to discern not <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nly good Writers from bad, and a proper stile <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rom a corrupt, but also to distinguish that which <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s pure in a good Author, from that which is vi­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ious and corrupt in him. And for want of all these <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>equisites, or the greatest part of them, most of <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ur ingenious young Men, take up some cry'd up <span class="hi">English</span> Poet for their Model, adore him, and <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>itate him as they think, without knowing where­ <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> he is defective, where he is Boyish and trifling, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>herein either his thoughts are improper to his <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ubject, or his Expressions unworthy of his Thoughts, or the turn of both is unharmoni<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>us. Thus it appears necessary that a Man shou'd be nice Critick in his Mother Tongue, before he <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ttempts to Translate a foreign Language. Nei­ <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>er is it sufficient that he be able to Iudge of <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ords and Stile; but he must be a Master of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e421"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> them too: He must perfectly understand his Au­thors Tongue, and absolutely command his own: So that to be a thorow Translatour, he must be a thorow Poet. Neither is it enough to give his Authors sence, in good <span class="hi">English,</span> in Poetical ex­pressions, and in Musical numbers: For, though all these are exceeding difficult to perform, there yet remains an harder task; and 'tis a secret of which few Translatours have sufficiently thought. I have already hinted a word or two concerning it; that is, the maintaining the Character of an Author, which distinguishes him from all others, an<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> makes him appear that individual Poet whom you wou'd interpret. For example, not only the thoughts, but the Style and Versification of <span class="hi">Vir­gil</span> and <span class="hi">Ovid,</span> art very different: Yet I see, even in our best Poets, who have Translated some parts of them, that they have confounded their several Talents; and by endeavouring only at the sweetness and harmony of Numbers, have made them both so much alike, that if I did not know the Originals, I shou'd never be able to Iudge by the Copies, which was <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> and which was <span class="hi">O­vid.</span> It was objected against a late noble Pain­ter, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e453"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> that he drew many graceful Pictures, but few of them were like. And this happen'd to him, because he always studied himself more than those who sate to him. In such Translatours I can easily distinguish the hand which perform'd the Work, but I cannot distinguish their Poet from another. Suppose two Authors are equally sweet, yet there is a great distinction to be made in sweet­ness, as in that of Sugar, and that of Honey. I can make the difference more plain, by giving you, (if it be worth knowing) my own method of proceeding, in my Translations out of four se­veral Poets in this Volume; <span class="hi">Virgil, Theocritus, Lucretius</span> and <span class="hi">Horace.</span> In each of these, be­fore I undertook them, I consider'd, the Genius and distinguishing Character of my Author. I look'd on <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> as a succinct and grave Ma­jestick Writer; one who weigh'd not only every thought, but every Word and Syllable. Who was still aiming to crowd his sence into as narrow a compass as possibly he cou'd; for which reason he is so very Figurative, that he requires, (I may almost say) a Grammar apart to construe him. His Verse is every where sounding the ve­ry <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e476"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> thing in your Ears, whose sence it bears: Yet the Numbers are perpetually varied, to increase the delight of the Reader; so that the same sounds are never repeated twice together. On the con­trary, <span class="hi">Ovid</span> and <span class="hi">Claudian,</span> though they Write in Styles differing from each other, yet have each of them but one sort of Musick in their Verses. All the versification, and little variety of <span class="hi">Clau­dian,</span> is included within the compass of four or five Lines, and then he begins again in the same tenour; perpetually closing his sence at the end of a Verse, and that Verse commonly which they call golden, or two Substantives and two Adje­ctives with a Verb betwixt them to keep the peace. <span class="hi">Ovid</span> with all his sweetness, has as little variety of Numbers and sound as he: He is always as it were upon the Hand-gallop, and his Verse runs upon Carpet ground. He avoids like the other all Synalaepha's, or cutting off one Vowel when it comes before another, in the follow­ing word: So that minding only smoothness, he wants both Variety and Majesty. But to return to <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> though he is smooth where smoothness is requir'd, yet he is so far from affecting it, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e502"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> that he seems rather to disdain it. Frequently makes use of Synalaepha's, and concludes his sence in the middle of his Verse. He is every where above conceipts of Epigrammatick Wit, and gross Hyperboles: He maintains Majesty in the midst of plainess; he shines, but glares not; and is stately without ambition, which is the vice of <span class="hi">Lu­can.</span> I drew my definition of Poetical Wit from my particular consideration of him: For propri­ety of thoughts and words are only to be found in him; and where they are proper, they will be de­lightful. Pleasure follows of necessity, as the effect does the cause; and therefore is not to be put into the definition. This exact propriety of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> I particularly regarded, as a great part of his Character; but must confess to my shame, that I have not been able to Translate any part of him so well, as to make him appear wholly like himself. For where the Original is close, no Version can reach it in the same compass. <span class="hi">Han­nibal Caro</span>'s in the <span class="hi">Italian,</span> is the nearest, the most Poetical, and the most Sonorous of any Tran­slation of the <span class="hi">Aeneids</span>; yet, though he takes the advantage of blank Verse, he commonly allows <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e531"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> two Lines for one of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> and does not always hit his sence. <span class="hi">Tasso</span> tells us in his Letters, that <span class="hi">Sperone Speroni,</span> a great <span class="hi">Italian</span> Wit, who was his Contemporary, observ'd of <span class="hi">Virgil</span> and <span class="hi">Tully</span>; that the <span class="hi">Latin</span> Oratour, endeavour'd to imitate the Copiousness of <span class="hi">Homer</span> the <span class="hi">Greek</span> Poet; and that the <span class="hi">Latine</span> Poet, made it his business to reach the conciseness of <span class="hi">Demosthe­nes</span> the <span class="hi">Greek</span> Oratour. <span class="hi">Virgil</span> therefore be­ing so very sparing of his words, and leaving so much to be imagin'd by the Reader, can never be translated as he ought, in any modern Tongue: To make him Copious is to alter his Character; and to Translate him Line for Line is impossi­ble; because the <span class="hi">Latin</span> is naturally a more suc­cinct Language, than either the <span class="hi">Italian, Spanish, French,</span> or even than the <span class="hi">English,</span> (which by reason of its Monosyllables is far the most com­pendious of them) <span class="hi">Virgil</span> is much the closest of any <span class="hi">Roman</span> Poet, and the <span class="hi">Latin</span> Hexameter, has more Feet than the <span class="hi">English</span> Heroick.</p><p>Besides all this, an Author has the choice of his own thoughts and words, which a Translatour has not; he is confin'd by the sence of the Inven­tor <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e611"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> to those expressions, which are the nearest to it: So that <span class="hi">Virgil</span> studying brevity, and having the command of his own Language, cou'd bring those words into a narrow compass, which a Translatour cannot render without Circumlocuti­ons. In short they who have call'd him the tor­ture of Grammarians, might also have call'd him the plague of Translatours; for he seems to have studied not to be Translated. I own that endea­vouring to turn his <span class="hi">Nisus</span> and <span class="hi">Euryalus</span> as close as I was able; I have perform'd that <span class="hi">Episode</span> too literally; that giving more scope to <span class="hi">Mezen­tius</span> and <span class="hi">Lausus,</span> that Version which has more of the Majesty of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> has less of his concise­ness; and all that I can promise for my self, is only that I have done both, better than <span class="hi">Ogleby,</span> and perhaps as well as <span class="hi">Caro.</span> So, that methinks I come like a Malefactor, to make a Speech upon the Gallows, and to warn all other Poets, by my sad example, from the Sacrilege of Translating <span class="hi">Virgil.</span> Yet, by considering him so carefully as I did before my attempt, I have made some faint resemblance of him; and had I taken more time, might possibly have succeeded bet­ter; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e658"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> but never so well, as to have satisfied my self.</p><p>He who excells all other Poets in his own Lan­guage, were it possible to do him right, must ap­pear above them in our Tongue, which, as my Lord <span class="hi">Roscomon</span> justly observes approaches near­est to the <span class="hi">Roman</span> in its Majesty: Nearest in­deed, but with a vast interval betwixt them. There is an inimitable grace in <span class="hi">Virgils</span> words, and in them principally consists that beauty, which gives so unexpressible a pleasure to him who best understands their force; this Diction of his, I must once again say, is never to be Copied, and since it cannot, he will appear but lame in the best Translation. The turns of his Verse, his breakings, his propriety, his numbers, and his gravity, I have as far imitated, as the poverty of our Language, and the hastiness of my per­formance wou'd allow. I may seem sometimes to have varied from his sence; but I think the great­est variations may be fairly deduc'd from him; and where I leave his Commentators, it may be I understand him better: At least I Writ with­out consulting them in many places. But two par­ticular <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e689"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> Lines in <span class="hi">Mezentius</span> and <span class="hi">Lausus,</span> I can­not so easily excuse; they are indeed remotely ally'd to <span class="hi">Virgils</span> sence; but they are too like the trifling tenderness of <span class="hi">Ovid</span>; and were Print­ed before I had consider'd them enough to alter them: The first of them I have forgotten, and cannot easily retrieve, because the Copy is at the Press: The second is this; </p><div class="q"><div class="l">—When <span class="hi">Lausus</span> dy'd, I was already slain.</div></div><p>This appears pretty enough at first sight, but I am convinc'd for many reasons, that the ex­pression is too bold, that <span class="hi">Virgil</span> wou'd not have said it, though <span class="hi">Ovid</span> wou'd. The Reader may pardon it, if he please, for the freeness of the confession; and instead of that, and the former, admit these two Lines which are more according to the Author, </p><div class="q"><div class="l">Nor ask I Life, nor fought with that design;</div> <div class="l">As I had us'd my Fortune, use thou thine.</div></div><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e738"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span>Having with much ado got clear of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> I have in the next place to consider the genius of <span class="hi">Lucretius,</span> whom I have Translated more hap­pily in those parts of him which I undertook. If he was not of the best age of <span class="hi">Roman</span> Poetry, he was at least of that which preceded it; and he himself refin'd it to that degree of perfecti­on, both in the Language and the thoughts, that he left an easie task to <span class="hi">Virgil</span>; who as he suc­ceeded him in time, so he Copy'd his excellen­cies: for the method of the <span class="hi">Georgicks</span> is plain­ly deriv'd from him. <span class="hi">Lucretius</span> had chosen a Subject naturally crabbed; he therefore adorn'd it with Poetical descriptions, and Precepts of Morality, in the beginning and ending of his Books. Which you see <span class="hi">Virgil</span> has imitated with great success, in those four Book<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, which in my Opinion are more perfect in their kind, than even his Divine <span class="hi">Aenoids.</span> The turn of his Verse he has likewise follow'd, in those places which <span class="hi">Lucretius</span> has most labour'd, and some of his very Lines he has transplanted in­to his own Works, without much variation. If I am not mistaken, the distinguishing Character <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e786"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> of <span class="hi">Lucretius</span>; (I mean of his Soul and Genius) is a certain kind of noble pride, and positive as­sertion of his Opinions. He is every where con­fident of his own reason, and assuming an ab­solute command not only over his vulgar Reader, but even his Patron <span class="hi">Memmius.</span> For he is al­ways bidding him attend, as if he had the Rod over him; and using a Magisterial authority, while he instructs him. From his time to ours, I know none so like him, as our Poet and Phi­losopher of <span class="hi">Malmsbury.</span> This is that perpetu­al Dictatorship, which is exercis'd by <span class="hi">Lucreti­us</span>; who though often in the wrong, yet seems to deal <span class="hi">bonâ fide</span> with his Reader, and tells him nothing but what he thinks; in which plain sincerity, I believe he differs from our <span class="hi">Hobbs,</span> who cou'd not but be convinc'd, or at least doubt of some eternal Truths which he has oppos'd. But for <span class="hi">Lucretius,</span> he seems to disdain all man­ner of Replies, and is so confident of his cause, that he is before hand with his Antagonists; Urging for them, whatever he imagin'd they cou'd say, and leaving them as he supposes, without an objection for the future. All this too, with so much scorn and indignation, as if he were <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e827"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> assur'd of the Triumph, before he enter'd into the <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>sts. From this sublime and daring Geni­us of his▪ it must of necessity come to pass, that his thoughts must be Masculine, full of Argu­mentation, and that sufficiently warm. From the same fiery temper proceeds the loftiness of his Expressions, and the perpetual torrent of his Verse, where the barrenness of his Subject does not too much constrain the quickness of his Fancy. For there is no doubt to be made, but that he cou'd have been every where as Poetical, as he is in his Descriptions, and in the Moral part of his Philosophy, if he had not aim'd more to instruct in his Systeme of Nature, than to de­light. But he was bent upon making <span class="hi">Memmi­us</span> a Materialist, and teaching him to defie an in­visible power: In short, he was so much an A­theist, that he forgot sometimes to be a Poet. These are the considerations which I had of that Author, before I attempted to translate some parts of him. And accordingly I lay'd by my natural Diffidence and Scepticism for a while, to take up that Dogmatical way of his, which as I said, is so much his Character, as to make him that individual Poet. As for his Opinions con­cerning <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e855"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> the mortality of the Soul, they are so ab­surd, that I cannot if I wou'd believe them. I think a future state demonstrable even by natu­ral Arguments; at least to take away rewards and punishments, is only a pleasing prospect to a Man, who resolves before hand not to live mo­rally. But on the other side, the thought of being nothing after death is a burden unsupport­able to a vertuous Man, even though a Hea­then. We naturally aim at happiness, and can­not bear to have it confin'd to the shortness of our present Being, especially when we consider that vertue is generally unhappy in this World, and vice fortunate. So that 'tis hope of Futu­rity alone, that makes this Life tolerable, in ex­pectation of a better. Who wou'd not commit all the excesses to which he is prompted by his natural inclinations, if he may do them with se­curity while he is alive, and be uncapable of pu­nishment after he is dead! if he be cunning and secret enough to avoid the Laws, there is no band of morality to restrain him: For Fame and Reputation are weak ties; many men have not the least sence of them: Powerful men are only aw'd by them, as they conduce to their interest, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e879"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> and that not always when a passion is predomi­nant; and no Man will be contain'd within the bounds of duty, when he may safely transgress them. These are my thoughts abstractedly, and without entring into the Notions of our Christi­an Faith, which is the proper business of Di­vines.</p><p>But there are other Arguments in this Poem (which I have turn'd into <span class="hi">English,</span>) not belong­ing to the Mortality of the Soul, which are strong enough to a reasonable Man, to make him less in love with Life, and consequently in less ap­prehensions of Death. Such as are the natural Satiety, proceeding from a perpetual enjoyment of the same things; the inconveniencies of old age, which make him uncapable of corporeal plea­sures; the decay of understanding and memory, which render him contemptible and useless to o­thers; these and many other reasons so patheti­cally urg'd, so beautifully express'd, so adorn'd with examples, and so admirably rais'd by the <span class="hi">Prosopopeia</span> of Nature, who is brought in speaking to her Children, with so much autho­rity and vigour, deserve the pains I have taken with them, which I hope have not been unsuc­cessful, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e910"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> or unworthy of my Author. At least I must take the liberty to own, that I was pleas'd with my own endeavours, which but rarely hap­pens to me, and that I am not dissatisfied upon the review, of any thing I have done in this Au­thor.</p><p>'Tis true, there is something, and that of some moment, to be objected against my <span class="hi">English­ing</span> the Nature of Love, from the Fourth Book of <span class="hi">Lucretius:</span> And I can less easily answer why I Translated it, than why I thus Translated it. The Objection arises from the Obscenity of the Subject; which is aggravated by the too lively, and alluring delicacy of the Verses. In the first place, without the least Formality of an excuse, I own it pleas'd me: and let my Enemies make the worst they can of this Confession; I am not y<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t so secure from that passion, but tha<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> I want my Authors Antidotes against it. He has given the truest and most Philosophical account both of the Disease and Remedy, which I ever found in any Author: For which reasons I Translated him. But it will be ask'd why I turn'd him into this luscious <span class="hi">English,</span> (for I will not give it a worse word:) instead of an answer, I wou'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e939"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> ask again of my Supercilious Adversaries, whe­ther I am not bound when I Translate an Author, to do him all the right I can, and to Translate him to the best advantage? If to mince his mean­ing, which I am satisfi'd was honest and instru­ctive, I had either omitted some part of what he said, or taken from the strength of his expressi­on, I certainly had wrong'd him; and that free­ness of thought and words, being thus cashier'd in my hands, he had no longer been <span class="hi">Lucretius.</span> If nothing of this kind be to be read, Physicians must not study Nature, Anatomies must not be seen, and somewhat I cou'd say of particular pas­sages in Books, which to avoid prophaness I do not name: But the intention qualifies the act; and both mine and my Authors were to instruct as well as please. Tis most certain that barefac'd Baw­dery is the poorest pretence to wit imaginable: If I shou'd say otherwise, I shou'd have two great authorities against me: The one is the Essay on Poetry, which I publickly valued before I knew the Author of it, and with the commendation of which, my Lord <span class="hi">Roscomon</span> so happily begins his Essay on Tran­slated Verse: The other is no less than our ad­mir'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e967"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">Cowley</span>; who says the same thing in other words: For in his Ode concerning Wit, he writes thus of it; </p><div class="q"><div class="l">Much less can that have any place</div> <div class="l">At which a Virgin hides her Face:</div> <div class="l">Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just</div> <div class="l">The Author blush, there where the Reader must.</div></div><p>Here indeed Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley</span> goes farther than the Essay; for he asserts plainly that obscenity has no place in Wit; the other only says, 'tis a poor pretence to it, or an ill sort of Wit, which has no­thing more to support it than bare-fac'd Ribaldry; which is both unmannerly in it self, and fulsome to the Reader. But neither of these will reach my case: For in the first place, I am only the Tran­slatour, not the Inventor; so that the heaviest part of the censure falls upon <span class="hi">Lucretius,</span> before it reaches me: in the next place, neither he nor I have us'd the grossest words; but the cleanliest Me­taphors we cou'd find, to palliate the broadness of the meaning; and to conclude, have carried the Poetical part no farther, than the Philosophical exacted. There is one mistake of mine which I <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1002"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=13">[Page]</a></span> will not <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ay to the Printers charge, who has enough to answer for in false pointings: 'tis in the word <span class="hi">Viper</span>: I wou'd have the Verse run thus, </p><div class="q"><div class="l">The Scorpion, Love, must on the wound be bruis'd.</div></div><p> There are a sort of blundering half-witted people, who make a great deal of noise about a Verbal slip; though <span class="hi">Horace</span> wou'd instruct them better in true Criticism: <span class="hi">Non ego paucis offendor maculis quas aut incuria fudit, aut humana parùm ca­vit natura.</span> True judgment in Poetry, like that in Painting, takes a view of the whole together, whether it be good or not; and where the beauties are more than the Faults, concludes for the Poet against the little Iudge; 'tis a sign that malice is hard driven, when 'tis forc'd to lay hold on a Word or Syllable; to arraign a Man is one thing, and to cavil at him is another. In the midst of an ill natur'd Generation of Scriblers, there is al­ways Iustice enough left in Mankind, to protect good Writers: And they too are oblig'd, both by humanity and interest, to espouse each others cause, against false Criticks, who are the common Ene­mies. This last consideration puts me in mind of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1030"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=13">[Page]</a></span> what I owe to the Ingenious and Learned Transla­tour of <span class="hi">Lucretius</span>; I have not here design'd to rob him of any part of that commendation, which he has so justly acquir'd by the whole Author, whose Fragments only fall to my Portion. What I have now perform'd, is no more than I intended above twenty years ago: The ways of our Translation are very different; he follows bim more closely than I have done; which became an Interpreter of the whole Poem. I take more liberty, because it best suited with my design, which was to make him as pleasing as I could. He had been too voluminous had he us'd my method in so long a work, and I had certainly taken his, had I made it my business to Translate the whole. The preference then is justly his; and I joyn with Mr. <span class="hi">Evelyn</span> in the confession of it, with this additional advantage to him; that his Reputation is already establish'd in this Poet, mine is to make its Fortune in the World. If I have been any where obscure, in fol­lowing our common Author, or if <span class="hi">Lucretius</span> him­self is to be condemnd, I refer my self to his ex­cellent Annotations, which I have often read, and always with some new pleasure.</p><p>My Preface begins already to swell upon me, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1053"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> looks as if I were afraid of my Reader, by so te­dious a bespeaking of him; and yet I have <span class="hi">Horace</span> and <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> upon my hands; but the <span class="hi">Greek</span> Gentleman shall quickly be dispatch'd, because I have more business with the <span class="hi">Roman.</span></p><p>That which distinguishes <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> from all other Poets, both <span class="hi">Greek</span> and <span class="hi">Latin,</span> and which raises him even above <span class="hi">Virgil</span> in his Eclogues, is the inimitable tenderness of his passions; and the natural expression of them in words so becoming of a Pastoral. A simplicity shines through all he writes: he shows his Art and Learning by disguising both. His Shepherds never rise above their Coun­try Education in their complaints of Love: There is the same difference betwixt him and <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> as there is betwixt <span class="hi">Tasso's Aminta,</span> and the Pa­stor <span class="hi">Fido</span> of <span class="hi">Guarini. Virgils</span> Shepherds are too well read in the Philosophy of <span class="hi">Epicurus</span> and of <span class="hi">Plato</span>; and <span class="hi">Guarini</span>'s seem to have been bred in Courts. But <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> and <span class="hi">Tasso,</span> have taken theirs from Cottages and Plains. It was said of <span class="hi">Tasso,</span> in relation to his similitudes, <span class="hi">Mai esce del Bosco:</span> That he never departed from the Woods, that is, all his comparisons were taken from the Country: The same may be said, of our <span class="hi">Theocri­tus;</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1129"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> he is softer than <span class="hi">Ovid,</span> he touches the passi­ons more delicately; and performs all this out of his own <span class="hi">Fond,</span> without diving into the Arts and Sciences for a supply. Even his Dorick Dialect has an incomparable sweetness in its Clownishness, like a fair Shepherdess in her Country Russet, talking in a <span class="hi">Yorkshire</span> Tone. This was impossible for <span class="hi">Virgil</span> to imitate; because the severity of the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Language denied him that advantage. <span class="hi">Spencer</span> has endeavour'd it in his Shepherds Ca­lendar; but neither will it succeed in <span class="hi">English,</span> for which reason I forbore to attempt it, For <span class="hi">The­ocritus</span> writ to <span class="hi">Sicilians,</span> who spoke that Dia­lect; and I direct this part of my Translations to our Ladies, who neither understand, nor will take pleasure in such homely expressions. I proceed to <span class="hi">Horace.</span></p><p>Take him in parts, and he is chiefly to be con­sider'd in his three different Talents, as he was a Critick, a Satyrist, and a Writer of Odes. His Mo­rals are uniform, and run through all of them; For let his <span class="hi">Dutch</span> Commentatours say what they will, his Philosophy was Epicurean; and he made use of Gods and providence, only to serve a turn in Poe­try. But since neither his Criticisms (which are <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1182"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> the most instructive of any that are written in this Art) nor his Satyrs (which are incomparably be­yond <span class="hi">Juvenals,</span> if to laugh and rally, is to be preferr'd to railing and declaiming,) are no part of my present undertaking, I confine my self wholly to his Odes: These are also of several sorts; some of them are Panegyrical, others Moral, the rest Iovial, or (if I may so call them) <span class="hi">Baccha­nalian.</span> As difficult as he makes it, and as indeed it is, to imitate <span class="hi">Pindar,</span> yet in his most elevated flights, and in the sudden changes of his Subject with almost imperceptible connexions, that <span class="hi">The­ban</span> Poet is his Master. But <span class="hi">Horace</span> is of the more bounded Fancy, and confines himself strictly to one sort of Verse, or Stanza in every Ode. That which will distinguish his Style from all o­ther Poets, is the Elegance of his Words, and the numerousness of his Verse; there is nothing so delicately turn'd in all the Roman Language. There appears in every part of his Diction, or, (to speak <span class="hi">English</span>) in all his Expressions, <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> kind of noble and bold Purity. His Words are chosen with as much exactness as <span class="hi">Virgils;</span> but there seems to be a greater Spirit in them. There is a secret Happiness attends his Choice, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1219"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> which in <span class="hi">Petronius</span> is call'd <span class="hi">Curiosa Felicitas,</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nd which I suppose he had from the <span class="hi">Feliciter <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>udere</span> of <span class="hi">Horace</span> himself. But the most di­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tinguishing part of all his Character, seems to me, to be his Briskness, his Iollity, and his good Humour: And those I have chiefly endea­vour'd to Coppy; his other Excellencies, I con­fess are above my Imitation. One Ode, which infinitely pleas'd me in the reading, I have at­tempted to translate in Pindarique Verse: 'tis that which is inscribd to the present Earl of <span class="hi">Ro­chester,</span> to whom I have particular Obligations, which this small Testimony of my Gratitude can never pay. 'Tis his Darling in the <span class="hi">Latine,</span> and I have taken some pains to make it my Master-Piece in <span class="hi">English</span>: For which reason, I took this kind of Verse, which allows more Latitude than any other. Every one knows it was intro­duc'd into our Language, in this Age, by the happy Genius of Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley.</span> The seeming easiness of it, has made it spread; but it has not been considerd enough, to be so well cultivated. It languishes in almost every hand but his, and some very few, (whom to keep the rest in coun­tenance) I do not name. He, indeed, has brought it as near Perfection as was possi­ble <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1276"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></span> in so short a time. But if I may be al­lowd to speak my Mind modestly, and without Injury to his sacred Ashes, somewhat of the Pu­rity of <span class="hi">English,</span> somewhat of more equal Thoughts, somewhat of sweetness in the Num­bers, in one Word, somewhat of a finer turn and more Lyrical Verse is yet wanting. As for the Soul of it, which consists in the Warmth and Vigor of Fancy, the masterly Figures, and the copiousness of Imagination, he has ex­celld all others in this kind. Yet, if the kind it self be capable of more Perfection, though ra­ther in the Ornamental parts of it, than the Essen­tial, what Rules of Morality or respect have I broken, in naming the defects, that they may here­after be amended? Imitation is a nice point, and there are few Poets who deserve to be Models in all they write. <span class="hi">Miltons</span> Paradice Lost is admi­rable; but am I therefore bound to maintain, that there are no flats amongst his Elevations, when 'tis evident he creeps along sometimes, for above an Hundred lines together? cannot I admire the height of his Invention, and the strength of his expression, without defending his antiquated words, and the perpetual harshness of their sound? 'Tis as much commendation as a Man can bear, to own him excel­lent; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1304"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></span> all beyond it is Idolatry. Since <span class="hi">Pindar</span> was the Prince of <span class="hi">Lyrick</span> Poets; let me have leave to say, that in imitating him, our numbers shou'd for the most part be Lyrical: For variety, or rather where the Majesty of the thought requires it, they may be stretch'd to the <span class="hi">English</span> Heroick of five Feet, and to the <span class="hi">French</span> Alexandrine of Six. But the ear must preside, and direct the Iudgment to the choice of numbers: Without the nicety of this, the Harmony of Pindarick Verse can never be com­pleat; the cadency of one line must be a rule to that of the next; and the sound of the former must slide gently into that which follows; without leaping from one extream into another. It must be done like the shadowings of a Picture, which fall by degrees into a darker colour. I shall be glad if I have so ex­plain'd my self as to be understood, but if I have not, <span class="hi">quod nequeo dicere &amp; sentio tantùm,</span> must be my excuse. There remains much more to be said on this subject; but to avoid envy, I will be silent. What I have said is the general Opinion of the best Iudges, and in a manner has been forc'd from me, by seeing a noble sort of Poetry so happily restor'd by one Man, and so grosly copied, by almost all the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>est: A musical eare, and a great genius, if another <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1331"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58020&amp;page=17">[Page]</a></span> Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley</span> cou'd arise, in another age may bring it to perfection.

This I grant is no excuse; for it may be reasonably urg'd, why did he not write with more leisure, or, if he had it not (which was certainly my case) why did he attempt to write on so nice a subject?
