## 1\. The Dying Lovers Reprieve. OR, The Reward of True Love.

With ſighs and tears her love he doth deſire,

Since Cupid hath his ſenſes ſet on fire;

His torment and his pain to her he ſhews,

With all his proteſtations and his vows:

At laſt ſhe yields to grant him ſome relief,

And make him joyful after all his grief.

Tune of, Digby's Farewel; Or, Give me the Laſs, &c.

With Allowance. Ro, L'Eſtrange.

FAireſt and deareſt to thee I am bound,

For love and affection thy ſervant to be,

Your skill I deſire to heal up my wound,

There's none in the world that can cure it but thee:

Then deareſt be pleaſed to do your endeavour,

And i'le be your ſervant to wait on you ever;

And thus you compel me unto you to cry,

Grant me thy affection, or elſe I ſhall dye.

The ground of my torment to thee i'le impart,

'Twas Cupid with's Arrow that wounded my heart,

Which pains me and grieves me that I cannot reſt,

brings tears from my eyes, & deep ſighs from my breaſt,

Which makes me go mourning to think on my grief,

My heart lies a burning for want of relief;

No hopes I have left to be eaſed of pain,

Unleſs you requite me with true love again.

Then deareſt be pleaſed to hear my requeſt,

And eaſe a poor patient and ſet me at reſt;

For you'r the Phiſitian which can by your art,

In this ſad condition give eaſe to my heart:

'Tis onely your love that ſo much I deſire,

Since thy charming my ſenſes doth fire:

Then deareſt releaſe me out of all my pain,

And ſtrive to require me with true love again.

LEt me be ſo happy your love to imbrace,

Or why did you ſhew me your beautiful face?

Why did you not cover your features ſo rare?

Which cauſed my heart to be caught in a ſnare:

Then might I have lived in peace and content,

& never have known what loves torments had ment;

But now you compel me unto you to cry,

I prithee love tell me, ſhall I live or dye?

Your love then reſtore me, and grant what I crave,

Or elſe to remove me from hence to the Grave;

Except you releaſe me, no joy I can find,

Whereby it may eaſe me and ſettle my mind:

For I am inthralled by your rowling eyes,

And you are the object wherein the fault lies:

Which makes me go monrning to think on my pain,

My heart lies a burning for cruel diſdain.

Although for my love you do prove ſo unkind,

I cannot retrain but muſt utter my mind;

I have been your ſervant a long time in vain,

My love it was fervent, and doth ſtill remain;

No hopes to remove it I find to my grief,

Unleſs you in pitty do grant me relief;

Then do not deny me when as I do cry,

O grant me your favour, or elſe I ſhall dye,

Therefore I beſeech you to hear my complaint,

And take ſome pitty before I do faint:

For I am caſt down with one glance of your eye,

And when you do frown, 'tis O then I could dye.

A ſmile from your beauty doth raviſh my m [...]

Becauſe I am pleaſed when as you ſeem kind

For then I do hope to find ſome relief,

At the hand of my dear, who hath cauſed my  [...]

But when I conſider you caſt me aſide,

O then I do fear you will not be my Bride;

But this I deſire, and this I do crave,

To have ſome requital for being your Slave

And ſo preſume for to venture my Dove,

To ſeal with a kiſs the Indenture of love:

Then make me no longer in vain for to cry,

But now tell me whether I ſhall live or dye.

Kind Sir then (ſhe ſaid) ſince your love it is tr [...]

I will heal your wound, and be kind unto you;

For well I have minded your ſorrow and pain,

Which you have endured by my cruel diſdain

But your fancy to pleaſe, I grant what you cr [...]

And your grief for to eaſe, my body you have;

Then wipe off your tears and caſt ſorrows awa [...]

For now I will pleaſe you by night and by day

Theſe words ſo revived his ſorrowful mind,

He was overjoy'd for to ſee her ſo kind;

He ſtraightway imbrac'd her, and gave her a ki [...]

To ſeal as a pledge of a true lovers bliſs:

And ſo from that inſtant united in love,

With conſtant affection that ne'r ſhall remove:

And now they live happy in joy and content,

And for what is paſt have no cauſe to repent,
