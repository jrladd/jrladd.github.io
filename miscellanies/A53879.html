When ſhortly after it was happily manifeſt­ed in very deed to all Nations, how their Navy which they termed invincible, conſiſting of 140 Sail of Ships, not only of their own Kingdom, but ſtrengthened with the greateſt <span class="hi">Argoſies, Portugal Caracks, Florentines,</span> &amp; huge hulks of other Countrys, were by 30. of her Majeſties Ships of War, and a few of our own Merchants, by the Wife, Valiant, and advantagious Conduct of the Lord <span class="hi">Charles Howard, High-Admirall of England,</span> beaten and ſhuffled together; even from the <span class="hi">Lizard</span> in <span class="hi">Cornwall,</span> firſt to <span class="hi">Portland,</span> where they ſhamefully le<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t <span class="hi">Don, Pedro de Valdes,</span> with his mighty Ship; from <span class="hi">Portland</span> to <span class="hi">Cales</span> where they loſt <span class="hi">Hugo de Moncado,</span> with the <span class="hi">Gallias,</span> of which he was Captain, &amp; from <span class="hi">Cales</span> driven with Squibs from their Anchors, were chaſed out of the ſight of <span class="hi">Eng­land,</span> round about <span class="hi">Scotland</span> and <span class="hi">Ireland.</span> Where for the Sympathy of their barbarous Religion, hoping to find Succour and aſſiſtance, a great part of them were cruſht againſt the Rocks, and thoſe other that landed, being ve­ry many in number, were notwithſtanding broken, ſlain, and taken, and ſo ſent from Village to Village coupled in halters, to be ſhipped into <span class="hi">England:</span> Where her Majeſty of her Princely and Invincible diſpoſition, diſdaining to put them to death, and ſcorning either to retain or en­tertain them; they were all ſent back again to their Countrys, to witneſs and recount the worthy Achieve­ments of their Invincible and Dreadfull Navy: Of which the number of Souldiers, the fearfull burthen of their Ships, the Commanders names of every Squadron, with all other their Magazines of proviſions, were put in Print, as an Army and Navy unreſiſtable, and diſdain­ing prevention. With all which ſo great and terrible an oſtentation, they did not in all their Sailing round a­bout <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2849"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=21">[Page 31]</a></span> <span class="hi">England,</span> ſo much as Sink or take one Ship, Bark, Pinneſſe or Cock-boat of ours; Or ever burnt ſo much as one Sheepcote of this Land; Whereas on the contra­ry, Sir <span class="hi">Francis Drake</span> with only 800. Souldiers not long before, landed in their <span class="hi">Indies,</span> and forced <span class="hi">Sant Iago, Santo Domingo, Cartagena,</span> and the fort of <span class="hi">Florida.</span></p><p>And after that, Sr <span class="hi">John Norris</span> marched from <span class="hi">Peniche</span> in <span class="hi">Portugall,</span> with a handfull of Souldiers, to the gate of <span class="hi">Lisbone,</span> being about 40 Engliſh miles.

In this ſort I have a little digreſſed from my firſt purpoſe; only by the neceſſary compariſon of theirs and our actions: The one covetous of honour with­out vaunt of oſtentation; the other ſo greedy to purchaſe the opinion of their own affairs, and by falſe Rumors to reſiſt the bluſt of their own diſhonours, as they will not only not bluſh to ſpread all manner of Untruths: But even for the leaſt advantage, be it but for the talring of one poor Adventurer of the <span class="hi">Engliſh,</span> will celebrate the Victory with Bonfires in every Town, always ſpending more in Faggors, then the purchaſe was worth they obtained. When as we never thought it worth the conſumption of two Billets, when we have ta­ken Eight or Ten of their <span class="hi">Indian Ships</span> at one time, and Twenty of the <span class="hi">Braſill Fleet:</span> Such is the difference between true Valour, and Oſtentation: and between Honourable Actions and frivolous Vain glorious vaunts. But now to return to my purpoſe.</p><p>The <span class="hi">Lord Thomas Howard</span> with Six of her Majeſties Ships, Six Victualers of <span class="hi">London,</span> the <span class="hi">Bark Ralegh,</span> and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2917"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=22">[Page 32]</a></span> two or three other Pinnaces riding at Anchor near unto <span class="hi">Flores,</span> one of the <span class="hi">Weſterly Iſlands</span> of the <span class="hi">Azores,</span> the Laſt of <span class="hi">Auguſt</span> in the afternoon, had intelligence by one Captain <span class="hi">Middleton</span> of the approach of the <span class="hi">Spa­niſh Armada</span> Which <span class="hi">Middleton</span> being in a very good Sailer, had kept them Company three days before, of good purpoſe, both to diſcover their Forces the more, as alſo to give advice to my <span class="hi">Lord Thomas</span> of their approach. He had no ſooner delivered the news but the Fleet was in ſight many of our Ships Com­panys were on Shore in the <span class="hi">Iſland;</span> ſome providing ba­laſt for their Ships; others filling of Water, and refreſh­ing themſelves from the Land, with ſuch things as they could either for Money, or by Force recover. By reaſon whereof our Ships being all peſtered and ro­maging every thing out of order, very light for want of balaſt, and that which was moſt to our diſadvan­tage the one half part of the men of every Ship ſick, and utterly unſerviceable: For in the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> there were Ninety diſeaſes: in the <span class="hi">Bonaventure,</span> not ſo many in health as could handle her Main-Sail. For had not Twenty men been taken out of a <span class="hi">Bark</span> of Sr <span class="hi">George Ca­reys,</span> his being commanded to be ſunk, and thoſe ap­pointed to her, ſhe had hardly ever recovered <span class="hi">England.</span> The reſt, for the moſt part, were in little better State.

The <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Fleet having <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3039"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=22">[Page 33]</a></span> ſhrouded their approach by reaſon of the <span class="hi">Iſland;</span> were now ſo ſoon at hand, as our Ships had ſcarce time to weigh their Anchors, but ſome of them were driven to let ſlip their Cables and ſet ſail. Sr <span class="hi">Richard Gran­vill</span> was the laſt that weighed, to recover the men that were upon the <span class="hi">Iſland,</span> which otherwiſe had been loſt. The Lord <span class="hi">Thomas,</span> with the reſt very hardly reco­vered the Wind, which Sr <span class="hi">Richard Granvill</span> not being able to do, was perſuaded by the Maſter, and others, to cut his Main Sail, and caſt about, and to truſt to the Sailing of the Ship; for the Squadron of <span class="hi">Sivil</span> were on his Weather-Bow. But Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> utterly refuſed to trun from the Enemies, alledging that he would ra­ther chooſe to dye, then to dishonour himſelf, his Coun­try, and her Majeſties Ship, perſuading his Company that he would paſs through the two Squadrons, in de­ſpight of them, and enforce thoſe of <span class="hi">Sivil</span> to give him way. Which he performed upon divers of the formoſt, who, as the Mariners term it, ſprang their Luff, and fell under the Lee of the <span class="hi">Revenge.</span> But the other courſe had been the better, and might right well have been anſwered, in ſo great an impoſſibility of Prevailing. Notwithſtanding, out of the greatneſs of his mind, he could not be perſuaded. In the mean while as he at­tended thoſe which were neareſt him, the great <span class="hi">San Philip</span> being in the Wind of him, and coming towards him, becalmed his Sails in ſuch ſort, as the Ship could neither make way, nor feel the Helm: ſo huge and high-carged was the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Ship, being of a Thouſand and Five Hundred Tuns, who after laid the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> abord. When he was thus bereft of his Sails, the Ships that were under his lee luffing up, alſo laid him abord: of which the next was the <span class="hi">Admiral of the Biſcaines,</span> a very mighty and puiſſant Ship commanded by <span class="hi">Brittan­dona,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3100"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=23">[Page 34]</a></span> the ſaid <span class="hi">Philip</span> carried three tire of Ordinance on a ſide, and eleven Pieces in every tire. She ſhot Eight forth-right out of her Chaſe, beſides thoſe of her Stern-Ports.</p><p>After the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> was entangled with this <span class="hi">Philip.</span> four other boorded her; two on her Larboord, and two on her Starboord. The Fight thus beginning at three of the Clock in the Afternoon, continued very terrible all that Evening. But the great <span class="hi">San Philip</span> having re­ceived the Lower Tire of the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> Diſcharged with Croſs-bar ſhot, Shirted her ſelf with all diligence from her ſides, utterly miſliking her firſt entertainment. Some ſay that the Ship Foundred but we cannot report it for truth, unleſs we were aſſured. The Spaniſh Ships were filled with Companys of Souldiers, in ſome Two Hundred, beſides the Mariners, in ſome Five, in others Eight Hundred. In ours there were none at all beſides the Mariners but the Servants of the Commanders, and ſome few Voluntary Gentlemen only. After many en­terchanged Vollies of Great Ordinance and Small Shot, the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> deliberated to enter the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> and made divers attempts, hoping to force her by the Mul­titudes of their Armed Souldiers and Musketters, but were ſtill repulſed again and again, and at all times beaten back into their own Ships, or into the Seas. In the beginning of the Fight, the <span class="hi">George Noble of London,</span> having received ſome Shot thorow her by the <span class="hi">Armadas,</span> fell under the Lee of the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> and asked Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> what he would Command him, being but one of the Victualers and of ſmall force: Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> bid him ſave himſelf, and leave him to his fortune. After the Fight had thus, without intermiſſion conti­nued while the Day laſted, and ſome hours of the Night, many of our Men were ſlain and hurt, and one of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3150"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=23">[Page 35]</a></span> the great Gallions of the <span class="hi">Armada,</span> and the Admiral of the Hulks both Sunk, and in many other of the <span class="hi">Spaniſh Ships</span> great Slaughter was made. Some write that Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> was very dangerouſly hurt almoſt in the beginning of the Fight, and lay Speechleſs for a time e're he Recovered; But two of the <span class="hi">Revenges</span> own company, brought home in a Ship of <span class="hi">Lime</span> from the <span class="hi">Iſlands,</span> Examined by ſome of the Lords, and Others, affirmed that he was never ſo Wounded as that he forſook the Upper Deck, 'till an hour before Midnight; and then being ſhot into the Body with a Musket, as he was a dreſſing, was again ſhot into the Head, and withall, his Chirurgion wounded to death. This agreeth alſo with an Examination taken by Sr <span class="hi">Francis Godolphin,</span> of four other Mariners of the ſame Ship being returned, which Examination, the ſaid Sr <span class="hi">Francis</span> ſent unto Maſter <span class="hi">William Killegrue,</span> of her Majeſties Privy Chamber.</p><p>But to return to the Fight, The <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Ships which attempted to boord the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> as they were wounded and beaten off, ſo allways others came in their places, ſhe having never leſs then two mighty Gallions by by her ſides, and aboard her: So that e'ere the Morn­ing, from Three of the Clock the day before, there had Fifteen ſeverall <span class="hi">Armadas</span> aſſailed her, and all ſo ill approved their entertainment, as they were by the break of day, far more willing to hearken to a Com­poſition, then haſtily to make any more Aſſaults or Entries. But as the day encreaſed, ſo our men decreaſed: and as the light grew more and more, by ſo much more grew our diſcomforts. For none appeared in fight but enemies, ſaving one ſmall Ship called the <span class="hi">Pilgrim,</span> commanded by <span class="hi">Jacob Whiddon,</span> who hovered all night to ſee the Succeſs: but in the morning bearing with the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> was hunted like a Hare a­mongſt <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3208"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=24">[Page 36]</a></span> many ravenous Hounds, but eſcaped.</p><p>All the Powder of the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> to the laſt Barrell was now ſpent, all her Pikes broken, Forty of her beſt men ſlain, and the moſt part of the reſt hurt. In the be­ginning of the Fight ſhe had but one hundred free from Sickneſs, and fourſcore and ten Sick, laid in Hold upon the Ballaſt. A ſmall Troup to man ſuch a Ship, and a weak Garriſon to reſiſt ſo mighty an Army. By thoſe hundred all was ſuſtained, the volleis, boordings, and entrings of fifteen Ships of War, beſides thoſe which beat her at large. On the contrary, the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> were always ſupplied with Souldiers brought from every Squadron: all-manner of Arms and Powder at will. Unto ours there remained no comfort at all, no hope, no ſupply either of Ships, Men, or Weapons; the Ma­ſters all beaten over-bord, all her tackle cut aſunder, her upper work altogether raſed, and in effect evened ſhe was with the water, but the very foundation or bottom of a Ship, nothing being left over-head either for flight or defence.

The <span class="hi">Maſter Gunner</span> readily con­deſended and divers others; but the <span class="hi">Captain</span> and the <span class="hi">Maſter</span> were of another opinion, and beſought Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> to have care of them; alledging that the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> would be as ready to entertain a Compoſition, as they were willing to offer the ſame; and that there being divers ſufficient and Valiant Men yet living, and whoſe Wounds were not Mortall, they might do their Coun­try and Prince acceptable Service hereafter. And where­as, Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> had alledged that the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> ſhould never Glory to have taken one Ship of her Majeſty, ſeeing they had ſo long and ſo notably defended them­ſelves; they anſwered, that the Ship had Six-foot Water in hold, Three ſhot under Water, which were ſo weakly ſtopped, as with the firſt working of the Sea, ſhe muſt needs Sink, and was beſides ſo Cruſht and Bruiſed, as ſhe could never be removed out of the Place.</p><p>And as the matter was thus in diſpute, and Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> refuſing to hearken to any of thoſe reaſons; the Maſter of the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> (while the Captain wan unto him the greater Party) was conveyed aboard the General <span class="hi">Don Alfonſo Bazan.</span> Who (finding none over-haſty to enter the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> again, doubting leaſt Sr <span class="hi">Richard</span> would have Blown them up and himſelf, and perceiving by the Report of the Maſter of the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> his dangerous <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3300"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=25">[Page 38]</a></span> diſpoſition) yielded that all their Lives ſhould be ſaved, the Company ſent for <span class="hi">England,</span> and the better ſort to pay ſuch reaſonable Ranſom as their Eſtate would bear, and in the mean Seaſon to be free from <span class="hi">Gally,</span> or <span class="hi">Impriſon­ment.</span> To this he ſo much the rather condeſcended as well, as I have ſaid, for fear of further leſs and miſchief to themſelves, as alſo for the deſire he had to recover Sir <span class="hi">Richard Granvill,</span> whom for his notable valour he ſeemed greatly to Honour and Admire.</p><p>When this anſwer was returned, and that ſafety of Life was promiſed, the Common ſort being now at the end of their Perill, the moſt drew back from Sir <span class="hi">Richard,</span> and the <span class="hi">Maſter Gunner;</span> being no hard matter to diſſwade men from Death to Life. The <span class="hi">Maſter Gunner</span> finding himſelf and Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> thus prevented and Maſtered by the greater number, would have ſlain himſelf with a Sword, had he not been by force with­held and locked into his Cabbin. Then the Generall ſent many Boats aboard the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> and divers of our men fearing Sir <span class="hi">Richards</span> diſpoſition, Stole away aboard the General and other Ships; Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> thus over-matched was ſent unto by <span class="hi">Alfonſo Bazan</span> to remove out of the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> the Ship being Marvellous unſa­vory, filled with Blood and Bodies of Dead, and Wound­ed men like a Slaughter houſe. Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> anſwered, that he might do with his Body what he liſt, for he eſteemed it not, and as he was carried out of the Ship he Sounded, and Reviving again deſired the Company to pray for him. The General uſed Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> with all Humanity, and left nothing unattempted that tended to his Recovery, highly commending his Valour and worthineſs, and greatly bewailing the danger wherein he was, being unto them a Rare Spectacle, and a Re­ſolution ſeldom approved, to ſee one Ship turn towards <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3361"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=25">[Page 39]</a></span> ſo many Enemies, to endure the charge and boording of ſo many huge <span class="hi">Armadas,</span> and to reſiſt and repell the aſſaults and entries of ſo many Souldiers. All which and more is confirmed by a <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Captain of the ſame <span class="hi">Armada,</span> and a preſent actor in the fight, who being ſevered from the Reſt in a Storm, was by the <span class="hi">Lion of London,</span> a ſmall Ship, taken, &amp; is now Priſoner in <span class="hi">London.</span></p><p>The General Commander of the <span class="hi">Armada,</span> was <span class="hi">Don Alphonſo Bazan,</span> Brother to the Marqueſs of <span class="hi">Santa Cruz.</span> The Admiral of the <span class="hi">Biſcaine Squadron,</span> was <span class="hi">Britandona,</span> of the <span class="hi">Squadron</span> of <span class="hi">Sivil</span> the Marqueſs of <span class="hi">Arumburch.</span> The <span class="hi">Hulks</span> and <span class="hi">Flyboats</span> were Commanded by <span class="hi">Luis Coutinho.</span> There were Slain and Drowned in this fight, well near One Thouſand of the Enemies, and Two ſpecial Commanders <span class="hi">Don Luis de Sant John,</span> and <span class="hi">Don George de Prunaria de Mallaga,</span> as the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Captain confeſſeth, beſides divers others of ſpecial account, whereof as yet report is not made.</p><p>The Admiral of the <span class="hi">Hulks</span> and the <span class="hi">Aſcenſion of Sivil</span> were both Sunk by the ſide of the <span class="hi">Revenge;</span> one other recovered the Rode of <span class="hi">Saint Michael,</span> and ſunk alſo there; a fourth ran her ſelf with the Shore to ſave her men. Sir <span class="hi">Richard</span> died, as it is ſaid, the Second or Third day aboard the General, &amp; was by them greatly bewailed. What became of his body, whether it were buried in the Sea or on the Land we know not: the comfort that remaineth to his Friends is, that he hath ended his Life honourably, in reſpect of the reputation won to his Nation and Country, and of the ſame to his Poſterity, and that being dead, he hath not out-lived his own honour.</p><p>For the reſt of her Majeſties Ships that entred not ſo far into the Fight as the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> the reaſons and cauſes were theſe. There were of them but ſix in all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3448"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=26">[Page 40]</a></span> whereof two but ſmall Ships; the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> ingaged paſt recovery: The <span class="hi">Iſland</span> of <span class="hi">Flores</span> was on the one ſide, 53 Sail of the <span class="hi">Spaniſh,</span> divided into Squadrons on the other, all as full filled with Souldiers as they could contain: Almoſt the one half of our men ſick and not able to ſerve: The Ships grown foul, unromaged, and ſcarcely able to bear any Sail for want of Balaſt, having been ſix months at the Sea before. If all the reſt had entred, all had been loſt: for the very hugeneſs of the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Fleet, if no other Violence had been offered, would have cruſht them between them into Shivers. Of which the diſhonour and loſs to the Queen had been far greater then the ſpoil or harm that the Ene­my could any way have received. Notwithſtanding it is very true, that the Lord <span class="hi">Thomas</span> would have entred between the Squadrons, but the reſt would not con­deſcend, and the Maſter of his own Ship offred to leap into the Sea, rather then to conduct that her Ma­jeſties Ship, and the reſt, to be a prey to the Enemy, where there was no hope nor Poſſibility either of De­fence or Victory. Which alſo in my opinion had ill ſorted or anſwered the diſcretion and truſt of a Ge­nerall, to commit himſelf and his charge to an aſſured deſtruction, without hope, or any likelyhood of pre­vailing: thereby to diminiſh the Strength of her Ma­jeſties Navy, and to enrich the pride and glory of the Enemy. The <span class="hi">Foreſight</span> of the Queens commanded by Mr <span class="hi">Thomas Vaviſor</span> performed a very great Fight, and ſtaid two hours as near the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> as as the Weather would permit him, not forſaking the Fight, 'till he was like to be encompaſſed by the Squadrons, and with great difficulty cleared himſelf. The reſt gave divers volleis of Shot, and entred as far as the place permitted, and their own neceſſities, to keep the weather­gage <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3496"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=26">[Page 41]</a></span> of the Enemy, untill they were parted by night. A few days after the Fight was ended, and the <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> Priſoners diſperſed into the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> and <span class="hi">Indie</span> Ships, there aroſe ſo great a Storm from the <span class="hi">Weſt</span> and <span class="hi">North-Weſt,</span> that all the Fleet was diſperſed, as well the <span class="hi">Indian</span> Fleet which were then come unto them, as the reſt of the <span class="hi">Armada</span> that attended their arrival, of which 14 Sail, together with the <span class="hi">Revenge</span> and in her 200 <span class="hi">Spaniards,</span> were caſt away upon the <span class="hi">Iſle</span> of St <span class="hi">Michael</span> So it pleaſed them to honour the burial of that renowned Ship the <span class="hi">Revenge,</span> not ſuffering her to periſh alone, for the great honour ſhe atchieved in her life time. On the reſt of the <span class="hi">Iſlands</span> there were caſt away in this Storm 15 or 16 more of the Ships of War: and of an hun­dred and odd Sail of the <span class="hi">Indie</span> Fleet, expected this year in <span class="hi">Spain:</span> What in this Tempeſt, and what before in the <span class="hi">Bay</span> of <span class="hi">Mexico,</span> and about the <span class="hi">Bermudas,</span> there were 70 and odd conſumed and loſt, with thoſe ta­ken by our Ships of <span class="hi">London,</span> beſides one very rich <span class="hi">In­dian</span> Ship, which ſet her ſelf on fire, being boarded by the <span class="hi">Pilgrim,</span> and five other taken by Maſter <span class="hi">Wats</span> his Ship of <span class="hi">London,</span> between the <span class="hi">Havana</span> and <span class="hi">Cape</span> S. <span class="hi">Antonio.</span> The fourth of this Month of <span class="hi">November</span> we received Letters from the <span class="hi">Tercera,</span> affirming that there are 3000 bodies of men remaining in that <span class="hi">Iſland,</span> ſaved out of the periſhed Ships, and that by the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> own confeſſion, there are 10000 caſt away in this Storm, beſides thoſe that are periſhed between the <span class="hi">Iſlands</span> and the <span class="hi">Main.</span> Thus it hath pleaſed God to fight for us, and to defend the Juſtice of our Cauſe, againſt the ambitious and bloody pretences of the <span class="hi">Spaniard,</span> who ſeeking to devour all Nations, are Themſelves devoured. A manifeſt teſtimony how injuſt and diſ­pleaſing, their attempts are in the ſight of God, who <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3611"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=27">[Page 42]</a></span> hath pleaſed to witneſs by the ſucceſs of their affairs his miſlike of their bloody and injurious deſigns pur­poſed and practiſed againſt all Chriſtian Princes, over whom they ſeek unlawfull and ungodly Rule and Empery.</p><p>One day or two before this Wrack happened to the <span class="hi">Spaniſh</span> Fleet, when as ſome of our Priſoners deſired to be ſet on ſhore upon the <span class="hi">Iſlands,</span> hoping to be from thence tranſported into <span class="hi">England,</span> which liberty was formerly by the General promiſed: One <span class="hi">Morice Fitz. John,</span> Son of Old <span class="hi">John of Deſmond,</span> a notable Tray­tor, Couſin German to the late Earl of <span class="hi">Deſmond,</span> was ſent to the <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> from Ship to Ship, to perſwade them to ſerve the King of <span class="hi">Spain,</span> the arguments he uſed to induce them were theſe. The increaſe of Pay which he promiſed to be trebled: advancement to the better ſort: and the exerciſe of the True Catholique Religion, and ſafety of their Souls to all. For the firſt, even the beggerly and unnatural behaviour of thoſe <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> and <span class="hi">Iriſh</span> Rebells, that ſerv'd the King in that preſent action, was ſufficient to anſwer that firſt ar­gument of rich Pay. For ſo poor and beggerly they were, as for want of Apparell they ſtripped their poor Country-men Priſoners out of their ragged Garments worn to nothing by ſix Months ſervice, and ſpared not to deſpoil them even of their bloody Shirts, from their wounded bodies, and the very Shooes from their feet; A notable teſtimony of their rich entertainment and great Wages. The ſecond reaſon was hope of ad­vancement if they ſerved well, and would continue faithfull to the King. But what man can be ſo block­iſhly ignorant ever to expect place or honour from a forrain King, having no other argument or perſwa­ſion <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3659"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=27">[Page 43]</a></span> then his own diſloyalty; to be unnatural to his own Countrey that bred him; to his Parents that be­gat him; and rebellious to his true Prince, to whoſe obedience he is bound by Oath, by Nature, and by Religion: No, they are only aſſured to be imployed in all deſperate enterpriſes, to be held in ſcorn and diſdain ever among thoſe whom they ſerve. And that ever Traytor was either truſted or advanced I could never yet reade, neither can I at this time remember any example. And no man could have leſs becommed the place of an Orator for ſuch a purpoſe, then this <span class="hi">Morice of Deſmond.</span> For the Earl his Couſin being one of the greateſt Subjects in that Kingdom of <span class="hi">Ireland,</span> having almoſt whole Countries in his poſſeſſion; ſo ma­ny goodly Mannors, Caſtles, and Lordſhips; the Count Palatine of <span class="hi">Kerry</span> five hundred Gentlemen of his own name and family to follow him, beſides others (all which he poſſeſſed in peace for three or four hundred years) was in leſs then three years after his adhering to the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> and Rebellion, beaten from all his holds, not ſo many as ten Gentlemen of his name left living, himſelf taken and beheaded by a Souldier of his own Nation, and his Land given by a Parliament to her Majeſty, and poſſeſſed by the <span class="hi">Engliſh:</span> His o­ther Couſin Sir <span class="hi">John of Deſmond</span> taken by Maſter <span class="hi">John Zouch,</span> and his body hanged over the Gates of his na­tive City to be devoured by Ravens: the third Bro­ther Sr <span class="hi">James</span> hanged, drawn, and quartered in the ſame place. If he had withall vaunted of his ſucceſs of his own houſe, no doubt the Argument would have moved much, and wrought great effect; which be­cauſe he for that preſent forgot, I thought it good to remember in his behalf. For matter of Religion it would <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3700"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=28">[Page 44]</a></span> require a particular Volume, if I ſhould ſet down how irreligiouſly they cover their greedy and ambitious pre­tences, with that veil of Piety. But ſure I am, that there is no Kingdom or Common-wealth in all <span class="hi">Europe▪</span> but if they be reformed, they then Invade it for Religion ſake, if it be, as they term Catholique, they pretend Title; as if the Kings of <span class="hi">Caſtile</span> were the naturall heirs of all the world: and ſo between both, no Kingdom is unſought. Where they dare not with their own forces to invade, they baſely entertain the Traytors and Vagabonds of all Nations: ſeeking by thoſe and by their runnagate <span class="hi">Jeſuits</span> to win parts, and have by that means ruined many noble Houſes &amp; others in this Land, &amp; have extinguiſhed both their Lives and Families. What good, honour, or fortune ever Man yet by them atchieved, is yet unheard of, or un­written. And if our <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> Papiſts do but look into <span class="hi">Portu­gall,</span> againſt which they have no pretence of Religion, how the Nobility are put to death, impriſoned, their rich men made a Prey, &amp; all ſorts of People Captiv'd; they ſhall find that the Obedience even of the <span class="hi">Turks</span> is eaſy and a Li­berty, in reſpect of the Slavery and Tyranny of <span class="hi">Spain.</span> What have they done in <span class="hi">Sicill,</span> in <span class="hi">Naples, Millaine,</span> and in the Low-Countries; who hath there been ſpared for Religion at all? And it cometh to my remembrance of a certain Burger of <span class="hi">Antwerpe,</span> whoſe Houſe being entred by a Company of <span class="hi">Spaniſh Souldiers,</span> when they firſt Sacked the City, he beſought them to ſpare him and his Goods, being a Good Catholique, and one of their own Party and Faction; The <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> anſwered, that they knew him to be of a good Conſcience for himſelf; but his Money, Plate, Jewels, and Goods, were all Heretical, and therefore good prize. So they abuſed and tormented the Fooliſh <span class="hi">Fleming,</span> who hoped that an <span class="hi">Agnus Dei</span> had been a ſufficient target againſt <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3758"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=28">[Page 45]</a></span> all force of that Holy and Charitable Nation. Neither have they at any time as they proteſt, invaded the King­doms of the <span class="hi">Indies</span> and <span class="hi">Peru,</span> and elſewhere, but only led thereunto, rather to reduce the People to Chriſti­anity, then for either Gold or Empery; whenas in one only Iſland called <span class="hi">Hiſpaniola,</span> they have Waſted Thirty Hundred Thouſand of the Naturall People▪ be­ſides many Millions elſe in other places of the <span class="hi">Indies:</span> A poor and harmleſs people Created of God, and might have been wonn to his knowledge, as many of them were; and almoſt as many as ever were perſuaded there unto: The Story whereof is at large, Written by a Biſhop of their own Nation, called <span class="hi">Bartholomew de las Caſas,</span> and Tranſlated into <span class="hi">Engliſh,</span> and many other Languages, intituled, <span class="hi">The Spaniſh Cruelties.</span> Who would therefore repoſe truſt in ſuch a Nation of Ravenous Strangers, and eſpecially in thoſe <span class="hi">Spaniards,</span> which more greedily thirſt after Engliſh Blood, then after the lives of any other people of <span class="hi">Europe,</span> for the many overthrows and Diſhonours they have received at our hands, whoſe Weakneſs we have diſcovered to the World, and whoſe forces at home, abroad, in <span class="hi">Europe,</span> in <span class="hi">India,</span> by Sea and Land, we have even with hand­fulls of men and Ships, Overthrown and Diſhonoured. Let not therefore any <span class="hi">Engliſhman,</span> of what Religion ſoever, have other opinion of the <span class="hi">Spaniards,</span> but that thoſe whom he ſeeketh to winn of our Nation, he eſteemeth baſe and Traiterous, unworthy perſons, or unconſtant fools; and that he uſeth his pretence of Religion, for no other purpoſe but to bewitch us from the Obedience of our Naturall Prince; thereby hoping in time to bring us to Slavery and Subjection, and then none ſhall be unto them ſo odious and diſdained as the Traytors themſelves, who have ſold their Coun­trey <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3815"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98226&amp;page=29">[Page 46]</a></span> to a Stranger, and forſaken their faith and Obe­dience contrary to Nature and Religion; and con­trary to that humane and generall honour, not only of Chriſtians, but of Heathen and Irreligious Nations; who have always ſuſtained what labour ſoever, and em­braced even Death it ſelf, for their Country, Prince, or Common wealth. To conclude, it hath ever to this day pleaſed God to proſper and defend her Majeſty, to break the purpoſes of Malicious Enemies, of forſworn Tray­tors, and of unjuſt Practices and Invaſions.
