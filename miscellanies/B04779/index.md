## 1\. Poor Robin's Parley with DR. WILDE, OR, Reflections on The HƲMBLE
THANKS for His Majeſties Declaration FOR Liberty of CONSCIENCE.

NOW that the Duſt (Sir!) pretty well is laid

which by your Capering you lately made.

When ſeveral Poetaſters of the times,

Run out ha-loo to Bull bait your bold rimes,

Chatt'ring at you as Troops of ſmaller Fowl,

Are wont againſt (Minerva's bird) the Owl,

And your late Tipſi'd muſe ('tis hop'd again,

Has after this large caſt ſettled her Brain.

Vouchſafe t'admit your Brother to your ſight,

Who yet comes more to parley then to fight.

When firſt the Hawkers Baul'd i'th ſtreets Wild's name,

A lickoriſh longing to my pallate came;

A Feast of wit I look'd for, but, alas!

The meat ſmelt strong, and too much ſawce there was,

The Northern March, who would not grieve to ſee't,

Forc'd to claim kindred with a Ballad ſheet?

Methoughts it could not be, Wild's noble vain,

Should dwind [...]e thus into a Dogg'rel ſtrain,

Whoſe Muſe of yore did on a Loyal st [...]ing,

Triumphant Georgicks, and brave Carols ſing,

His Language flowing, and his fancies fine,

Rich as his face, and ſparkling as his wine

That he ſhou'd now in hobbling Meetre creep,

That (like his Sermons) only invites to ſleep.

But I'le not rob you of the glory due

Unto this Doughty Feat, on ſecond view

I find there's cauſe to gueſs (Sir!) 't may be you.

Who but a Doctor skill'd in all the Arts,

To mince a Text in four and Twenty parts,

So aptly could Commence his humble Thank',

With Threeſcore Lines about Star-Readers pranks,

With Tales of pimping Cuckolds, picking Fobs,

Going to Stool, and ſuch grave witty Bobs,

Upon your Prieſthood tell us Sir; of late

Have you not Ex [...]rciſed nigh Billingsgate?

We hereby find without a figure caſt,

That ſtill your Wild Phanatick Freaks do laſt,

The Dragons Tail to the Horoſcope doth cling,

And in your mouth lies its Invenom'd ſting,

Which makes you Hiſs at Reverend Prelates thus,

And ſeek once more to ſtart, the old luſty Puſs,

'Cauſe you have got your rambling Libertye,

So great, So vniverſal and ſo free

Muſt ſacred Functions taſty our Railleree.

Muſt you go dream, and wiſh the Rotchet may,

To the Lay-Elders Motley Coat give way?

The lofty Miter to the Blew-bonnet vail,

And grave Caſſock to curtail'd Jump ſtrike ſail;

Shall Wild-boars that not long ſince trampled down

Our thriving Ʋines, and cruſht them on the ground?

Now d eſs our Vineyards, or they feed our Flock

Who brought our Royal Shephe [...]d to the Block?

No, let ſuch Ʋultu [...]es Lurk in Buſhes Cold,

Whilſt ſtill our Loyal Swans their Steeples hold;

But tell me Wild! Is't not a Bull, or worſe,

We ſhall ha' th milk, yet you would fain be Nu [...]ſe?

'Tis plain you mean to ſtarve the little b [...]ood,

Or (what ſome fear) would bring them up with blood

You'd have all Joyn, even the Quakers too,

(Inſects that firſt crawl d out upon's from you)

And yet each Line betrays your curs'd intent,

Is only old Diviſions to foment,

To ſcoff at Clergy-Men of all degrees,

And ſaucily to Stile them Judaſes

Is ſure t' Abuſe this Act of G [...]a [...]e, the King

Indulg'd your Preaching not your Libelling;

To try your Tempers was his Royal will,

And you'r but on your good Behaviou 's ſtill;

Since your long Silenc'd Tongu [...]s again ſet free,

And gowty Toes to have their libertye,

Methinks henceforth they ſhould in Pu [...]pits prance,

And not thus wantonly in Sonnets Dance;

Fie! Fie! A Minister and Lampoon! give 'ore

Here's other fiſh to fry, play the fool no more

In Rhime, but now begin on the other Score.

Hark how the Thick ſcull'd Rams of your Fold bleat,

Away then with your Pipe, and give them meat,

The kinder Sisters too, come thronging round,

From Theeving-Lane, White-Chappel, Horſly-down▪

Whoſe free Benevolence more Treaſure brings

Then all our Tythes and Eaſter [...] offerings;

Beſides their Loving zeal's ſo great ſome ſay,

They know how to oblige another way,

Up, precious Man! then with a melting Tone,

A pious Goggle, and Counterfeit grone,

With tedious prayers, holy ſaying abuſ'd,

Good words forty times to no purpoſe uſ'd;

Strange Raptures, and Face wrinckled as if there

The Goſpel were Tranſcrib'd in Character;

Hold forth, till not one Handkerchief's left dry,

But all do weep, though not one Soul knows why;

By ſuch your we'l known Arts, thou'lt get o'th ſudden,

Good Wine, good Candles, good refreſhing Pudden▪

And for Tyth-piggs the Curate may'ſt Defie,

Since all the Sows belong unto thy Stye.

POOR ROBIN.
