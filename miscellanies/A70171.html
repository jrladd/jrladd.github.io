But you must not have your Eyes so continually fixt on them, as not to regard whither they lead you; for they deviate sometimes into Paths, where you cannot safely follow them. This Rule I my self have observ'd, in forsaking my Guides, and past that Way which no Body before me has done, as the following Dis­course will convince you.</p><p><span class="hi">Satyr</span> is a kind of Poesie, only known to the <span class="hi">Romans,</span> being not at all related to the <span class="hi">Satyrical Poesie</span> of the <span class="hi">Greeks,</span> as some learned Men have pretended. <span class="hi">Quintilian</span> leaves us no Doubt up­on this Point, when he writes in Chap. 10. <span class="hi">Satira quidem tota nostra est.</span> The same Reason makes <span class="hi">Horace</span> call it in the last Satyr of Book 1. <span class="hi">Graecis intactum Carmen.</span> The Natural and true Etymology is this: The <span class="hi">Latins</span> called it <span class="hi">SATVR, quasi plenum,</span> to which there was <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e949"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> nothing wanting for its Perfection. Thus <span class="hi">Satur color,</span> when the Wool has taken a good Dye, and nothing can be added to the Per­fection of it. From <span class="hi">Satur</span> they have made <span class="hi">Satura,</span> which they wrote sometimes with an <span class="hi">i, Satira</span>; They used in other Words, the same Variation of the Letter <span class="hi">u</span> into <span class="hi">i,</span> as in <span class="hi">Maxumus, Maximus, optumus, optimus. Satura,</span> is an <span class="hi">Adjective,</span> which has reference to a Sub­stantive understood; for the Ancient <span class="hi">Romans</span> said <span class="hi">Saturam,</span> understanding <span class="hi">Lancem.</span> And <span class="hi">Satura Lanx,</span> was properly a Bason fill'd with all sorts of Fruit, which they offer'd every Year to <span class="hi">Ceres,</span> and <span class="hi">Bacchus,</span> as the First Fruits of all they had gathered.

It had nothing so formidable in it, as it has now, when a bare Mention of Satyr makes them tremble, who would fain seem what they are not, for Satyr, with us, signifies the same thing, as <span class="hi">exposing,</span> or <span class="hi">lashing</span> of some thing, or Person: Yet this different Acceptation alters not the Word, which is always the same; but the <span class="hi">Latins</span> in the Titles of their Books, have often had regard only to the Word, in the extent of its Signification, found­ed on its Etymology, whereas we have had respect only to the first, and general Use, which has been made of it in the beginning to <span class="hi">mock,</span> and <span class="hi">deride</span>; yet this Word ought always to be writ in <span class="hi">Latin</span> with an (<span class="hi">u</span>) or <span class="hi">(i) Satura,</span> or <span class="hi">Satira,</span> and in English by an (<span class="hi">i</span>) those who have wrote it with a (<span class="hi">y</span>) thought with <span class="hi">Scaliger, Heinsius,</span> and a great many others, that the Divinities of the Groves, which the <span class="hi">Grecians</span> call'd <span class="hi">Satyrs,</span> the <span class="hi">Romans Fawns,</span> gave their Names to these Pieces; and that of the Word <span class="hi">Satyrus</span> they had made <span class="hi">Satyra,</span> and that these Satyrs had a great affi­nity with the Satyric Pieces of the <span class="hi">Greeks,</span> which is absolutely false, as <span class="hi">Casaubon</span> has very well prov'd it, in making it appear, That of the Word <span class="hi">Satyrus</span> they could never make <span class="hi">Satyra,</span> but <span class="hi">Satyrica</span>: And in shewing the Difference betwixt the Satyric Poems of the <span class="hi">Greeks,</span> and the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Satyrs.

The <span class="hi">Greeks</span> had never any thing that came near this Ro­man <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1842"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> Satyr, but their <span class="hi">Silli</span> [<span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>] which were also biting Poems, as they may easily be perceived to be yet, by some Fragments of the <span class="hi">Silli</span> of <span class="hi">Timon.</span> There was however this Difference, That the <span class="hi">Silli</span> of the Greeks were <span class="hi">Parodious,</span> from one End to the other, which cannot be said of the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Satyrs; where, if sometimes you find some <span class="hi">Parodia's,</span> you may plainly see that the Poet did not design to affect it, and by consequence the <span class="hi">Parodia</span>'s do not make the Essence of a Satyr, as they do the Essence of the <span class="hi">Silli.</span></p><p>Having explain'd the Nature, Origin and Pro­gress of <span class="hi">Satyr,</span> I'll now say a Word, or two of <span class="hi">Horace</span> in particular.</p><p>There cannot be a more just Idea given of this part of his Works, than in comparing them to the Statues of the <span class="hi">Sileni,</span> to which <span class="hi">Alcibiades</span> in the Ban­quet, compares <span class="hi">Socrates.</span> They were Figures, that without had nothing agreeable, or beautiful, but when you took the Pains to open them, you found the Figures of all the Gods. In the manner that <span class="hi">Horace</span> presents himself to us in his Satyrs, we dis­cover nothing of him at first, that deserves our At­tachment. He seems to be fitter to amuse Chil­dren than to employ the Thoughts of Men; but when we remove that, which hides him from our Eyes, and view him even to the Bottom, we find in him all the Gods together; that is to say, all those Vertues, which ought to be the continual Practice of such as seriously endeavour to forsake their Vices.</p><p>Hitherto we have been content to see only his out-side, and 'tis a strange thing, that Satyrs, which have been read so long, have been so little under­stood, or explain'd: They have made a Halt at the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1913"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> out-side, and were wholly busi'd in giving the Interpretation of Words. They have commented upon him like Grammarians, not Philosophers; as if <span class="hi">Horace</span> had writ meerly to have his Language un­derstood, and rather to divert, than instruct us. That is not the End of this Work of his. The end of any Discourse is the Action for which that Dis­course is compos'd; when it produces no Action, 'tis only a vain amusement, which idly tickles the Ear, without ever reaching the Heart.</p><p>In these two Books of his Satyrs, <span class="hi">Horace</span> would teach us, <span class="hi">to conquer our Vices, to rule our Passions, to follow Nature, to limit our Desires, to distinguish True from False, and Ideas from Things, to forsake Prejudice, to know throughly the Principles, and Motives of all our Actions, and to shun that Folly which is in all Men, who are bi­gotted to the Opinions they have imbibed under their Teachers, which they keep obstinately without examining whether they are well-grounded.</span> In a Word, <span class="hi">he en­deavours to make us happy for our selves, agreeable, and faithful to our Friends, easie, discreet, and honest to all, with whom we are oblig'd to live.</span> To make us under­stand the Terms he uses, to explain the Figures he employs, and to conduct the Reader safely through the Labyrinth of a difficult Expression, or obscure <span class="hi">Parenthesis,</span> is no great matter to perform: And as <span class="hi">Epictetus</span> says, there is nothing in that Beautiful, or truly worthy a wise Man. The principal, and most important Business, is to shew the Rise, the Reason, and the Proof of his Precepts, to demon­strate that those, who do not endeavour to correct themselvs by so beautiful a Model, are just like sick Men, who having a Book full of Receipts, proper to their Distempers, content themselves to read 'em, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1948"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> without comprehending them, or so much as know­ing the Advantage of them.</p><p>I urge not this because I have my self omitted any thing in these Annotations, which was the incum­bent Duty of a Grammarian to observe; this, I hope the World will be sensible of, and that there remains no more Difficulty in the Text. But that which has been my chief Care, is, to give an insight into the very matter, that <span class="hi">Horace</span> treats of, to shew the solidity of his Reasons, to discover the Turns he makes use of to prove what he aims at, and to refute or illude that which is opposed to him, to confirm, the Truth of his Decisions, to make the Delicacy of his Sentiments perceiv'd, to expose to open Day the Folly he finds in what he condemns. This is what none have done before me. On the contrary, as <span class="hi">Horace</span> is a true <span class="hi">Proteus,</span> that takes a thousand different Forms, they have often lost him, and not knowing where to find him, have grapled him as well as they could; they have palm'd upon him in several Places, not only Opinions, which he had not, but even those which he directly refutes: I don't say this to blame those who have taken Pains before me on the Works of this great Poet, I com­mend their Endeavours, they have open'd me the way; and if it be granted, that I have some little Advantage over them, I ow it wholly to the great Men of Antiquity, whom I have read with more Care, and without doubt with more Leisure. I speak of <span class="hi">Homer,</span> of <span class="hi">Plato,</span> and <span class="hi">Aristotle,</span> and of some other <span class="hi">Greek</span> and <span class="hi">Latin</span> Authors, which I study con­tinually, that I may form my taste on theirs, and draw out of their Writings, the justness of Wit, good Sense and Reason.</p><p><span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1987"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span>I know very well, that there are now adays some Authors, who laugh at these <span class="hi">great Names,</span> who dis­allow the Acclamations, which they have receiv'd from all Ages, and who would deprive them of the Crowns, which they have so well deserv'd, and which they have got before such August <span class="hi">Tribunals.</span> But for fear of falling into <span class="hi">Admiration,</span> which they look upon as the Child of Ignorance, they do not perceive that they go from that <span class="hi">Admiration,</span> which <span class="hi">Plato</span> calls the Mother of <span class="hi">Wisdom,</span> and which was the first that opened Mens Eyes. I do not wonder that the Celestial Beauties, which we find in the Writing of these incomparable Men, lose with them all their Attractives, and Charms, because they have not the Strength to keep their Eyes long enough upon them. Besides, it is much easier to despise than understand them. As for my self, I declare, that I am full of Admiration, and Veneration for their Divine Geniusses: I have them always before my Eyes, as Venerable and Incorruptible Judges; before whom I take pleasure to fancy, That I ought to give an account of my Writings. At the same Time I have a great Respect for Posterity, and I always think with more <span class="hi">Fear,</span> than Confidence, on the Judgment that will pass on my Works, if they are happy enough to reach it. All this does not hinder me from esteeming the great Men that live now. I acknowledge that there are a great many who are an Honour to our Age, and who wou'd have adorn'd the Ages pass'd. But amongst these great Men, I speak of, I do not know one, and there cannot be one, who does not esteem, and honour the Ancients, who is not of their taste, and who follows not their Rules.

Whether it be that we follow them by the only force of Natural Happiness, or Instinct, or that Art, and Study have conducted us thither. As for those who thus blame Antiquity, without knowing of it, once for all I'll undeceive them, and make it appear, that in giving all the advantage to our Age, they take the direct Course to dishonour it; for what greater Proofs can be of the Rudeness, or rather Barbarity of an Age, than in it, to hear <span class="hi">Ho­mer</span> called dull, and heavy, <span class="hi">Plato</span> tiresome, and tedi­ous, <span class="hi">Aristotle</span> ignorant, <span class="hi">Demosthenes</span> and <span class="hi">Cicero,</span> vul­gar Orators, <span class="hi">Virgil</span> a Poet without either Grace, or Beauty, and <span class="hi">Horace</span> an Author unpolished, languid, and without force? The <span class="hi">Barbarians</span> who ravag'd <span class="hi">Greece,</span> and <span class="hi">Italy,</span> and who laboured with so much fury to destroy all things that were fine and noble, have never done any thing so horrible as this. But I hope that the false taste of some particular Men with­out Authority, will not be imputed to the whole Age, nor give the least Blemish to the Ancients. 'Twas to no purpose that a certain Emperor de­clar'd himself an Enemy to <span class="hi">Homer, Virgil</span> and <span class="hi">Titus Livius.</span> All his Efforts were ineffectual, and the Oppsition he made to Works so perfect, serv'd on­ly to augment in his History the number of his Follies, and render him more odious to all Po­sterity.</p></div><div class="table_of_contents" id="index.xml-front.1_div.5"><div class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2076"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=55621&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></div><h2><span class="head">The INDEX.</span></h2><ul><li class="item"><span class="hi">A</span> Letter from Mr. <span class="hi">Prior,</span> to Mr. <span class="hi">Fleetwood Sheppard.</span> page. <span class="hi">1.</span></li><li class="item"><span class="hi">Horace,</span> Lib. <span class="hi">2.</span> Ode <span class="hi">14.
