There are two things especially, in which they stand in need of your defence: One is, That they fall so infinitely below the full and lofty <span class="hi">Genius</span> of that excellent Poet, who made this way of Writing, Free of our Nation: The other, That they are so little proportioned and equal to the renown of that Prince, on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives, deserving rather to be the subjects of the noblest Pens and most Divine Phansies, than of such small Beginners and weak Essayers in Poetry as my self. Against these dangerous prejudices, there remains no other shield, than the Vniversal Esteem and Authority, which your Iudgment and Ap­probation carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir, is not only on the account of the Relation you had to this great Person, nor of the general favour which all arts receive from you; but more particularly by reason of that Obligation and Zeal, with which I am bound to delicate my self to your service: For having been a long time the Object of your Care and Indulgence towards the ad­vantage of my Studies and Fortune, having been moulded (as it were) by your own Hands, and formed under your Government; not to intitle you to any thing which my meanness produces, would not only be Injustice, but Sacrilege:
