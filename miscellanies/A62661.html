For she was all, fancy and fine ima­gination could adorn her with, at least, the gazing Puppy thought so. 'Twas such I saw and lov'd; but knowing I did Adore, I made my humble Court, and she, by all my trembling, sighings, pantings, the going and returning of my Blood, found all my Weakness and her own Power; and using all the Arts of her Sex, both to ingage and secure me, play'd all the Woman over: She wou'd be scornful and kind by turns, as she saw conve­nient, This to check my Presumption and too ea­sy hope; That to preserve me from the brink of despair. Thus was I tost in the Blanket of Love, somtimes up, and somtimes down, as her Wit and Humor was in or out of tune, all which I watch'd, and waited like a Dog, that still the oftner kick'd wou'd fawn the more.</p><p>Oh, 'tis an excellent Art this managing of a Coxcomb, the Serpent first taught it our Gran­dam <span class="hi">Eve;</span> and <span class="hi">Adam</span> was the first Cully: E're since they have kept their Empire over Men, and we have, e're since, been Slaves.

She saw me young enough to do her Service, handsom enough to do her Credit, and Fortune enough to please her Vanity and Interest: She therefore suffer'd me to Love, and Bow among the Crowd, and fill her Train.

Eternally we loved, and lived together, no day nor night sepa­rated us, no Frowns interrupted our Smiles, no Clouds our Sun-shine; the Island was all perpetu­al Spring, still flowery and green, in Bowers, in Shades, by purling Springs and Fountains, we past our hours, unwearied and uninterrupted. I cannot express to you the happy Life I led, during this blessed Tranquility of Love, while <span class="hi">Silvia</span> still was pleased, and still was gay. We walked all day together in the Groves, and entertained ourselves with a thousand Stories of Love; we laught at the foolish World, who could not make their Felicity with out Crowds and Noise: We pittied Kings in Courts in this Retirement, so well <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e633"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=11">[Page 6]</a></span> we liked our Solitude; till on a day, (blest be that joyful day, though then 'twas most a-curst,) I say upon that day, I know not by what accident I was parted from my Charmer, and left her all alone, but in my absence, there incountred her a Woman extremely ugly, and who was however very nice and peevish, inconstant in her temper, and no one place could continue her: The finest things in the World were troublesom to her, and she was Shagreen at every thing; her Name is <span class="hi">Indifference;</span> she is a Person of very great Power in this Island, (though possibly you never incoun­tred her there,) and those that follow her, de­part from the <span class="hi">Isle of Love</span> without any great pains. She brought <span class="hi">Silvia</span> to the Lake of <span class="hi">Disgust,</span> whe­ther, in persuing her (at my return,) I found her, ready to take Boat to have past quite away, and where there are but too many to transport those Passengers, who follow <span class="hi">Indifference</span> over the Lake of <span class="hi">Disgust.</span> I saw this disagreeable Creature too, but she appeared too ugly for me to approach her, but forcing <span class="hi">Silvia</span> back, I returned again to the Palace of <span class="hi">True Pleasure,</span> where some days after there ar­rived to me a Misfortune, of which, I believed I should never have seen an end. I found <span class="hi">Silvia</span> in­viron'd round with new Lovers, still adoring and pleasing her a thousand ways, and though none of 'em were so rich, so young, or so handsom as I, she nevertheless failed not to treat 'em with all the Smiles and Caresses 'twas possible to imagin; when I complain'd of this, she would satisfy my fears with so many Vows and Imprecations, that I <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e674"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=11">[Page 7]</a></span> would believe her, and think myself unreasona­ble, but when she would be absent whole days, in an hundred places, she would find such probable Excuse, and lye with such a Grace, no mortal cou'd have accused her, so that all the whole Island took notice that I was a bassled Cuckold, be­fore I could believe she would deceive me, so hear­tily she damn'd herself: Through all the Groves I was the pointed Coxcomb, laught at aloud, and knew not where the jest lay; but thought myself as secure in the Innocence of my deceiving fair One, as the first hour I charmed her, and like a keeping Cully, lavish'd out my Fortune, my plenteous Fortune, to make her fine to Cuckold me.

I confess, this Object was so far from pleasing me, (as I believed a confirmation would,) that the change inspired me with a rage, which nothing else could do, and made me say things unbecoming the Dignity of my Sex, who ought to disdain those faithless Slaves, which Hea­ven first made to obey the Lords of the Creation. A thousand times I was about to have rush'd upon 'em, and have ended the Lives of the loose betray­ers of my repose, but Love stepp'd in and stay'd my hand, preventing me from an Outrage, that would have cost me that rest of Honour, I yet had left: But when my rage was abated, I fell to a more in­supportable Torment, that of extream Grief to find another possest of what I had been so long, and with so much Toil in gaining: 'Twas thus I re­tir'd, and after a little while brought myself to make calm Reflections upon this Adventure, which reduced me to some reason. When one day as I was walking in an unfrequented Shade, whither my Melancholy had conducted me, I incountred a Man, of a hauty look and meen, his Apparel rich and glorious, his Eyes awful, and his Stature tall; the very sight of him inspired me with coldness, which render'd me almost insensible of the infidelity of <span class="hi">Silvia.</span> This Person was <span class="hi">Pride,</span> who looking on me, as he past, with a fierce and disdainful Smile, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1032"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=16">[Page 17]</a></span> over his Shoulder, and regarding me with scorn, said;</p><div class="lg"><div class="l">Why shou'd that faithless wanton give</div><div class="l">Thy Heart so mortal pain,</div><div class="l">Whose Sighs were only to deceive,</div><div class="l">Her Oaths all false and vain?</div><div class="l">Despise those Tears thou shedd'st for her,</div><div class="l">Disdain to sigh her Name.</div><div class="l">To <span class="hi">Love,</span> thy Liberty prefer;</div><div class="l">To faithless <span class="hi">Silvia,</span> Fame.</div></div><p>I knew by his words he was <span class="hi">Pride,</span> or <span class="hi">Dis­dain,</span> and would have embraced him; but he put me off seeing <span class="hi">Love</span> still by me, who had not yet abandoned me, and turned himself from me with a regardless scorn, but I, who was resol­ved not to forsake so discreet a Counsellor, rather chose to take my leave of little <span class="hi">Love;</span> who had ever accompanyed me in this Voyage.

but that which charmed me most of all, was her Wit, which was too ingaging for me to defend my Heart against: I found mine immedi­ately submitting to her Conversation, and you may imagine I did not part with her so long as De­cency and good Manners permitted me to stay with her, which was as long as any Company was in the place; nor then, till by my importunity I had gained so much upon her to suffer my Visits, which she did with a Condescention that gave me abun­dance of hope.</p><p>I was no sooner gone, but my <span class="hi">Cupid,</span> who took care of me, and entertained me to the best Advan­tage, carryed me that Evening to a Ball, where there were a world of Beauties, among the rest one fair as imagination can conceive;

and that to subdue one so fair and so innocent, must needs be an ex­tream Pleasure: Yet did I not so wholly fix my de­sires on this lovely Person, but that the Wit of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1581"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=23">[Page 30]</a></span> <span class="hi">Bellinda</span> shared my Heart with the Beauty and Youth of <span class="hi">Bellimante,</span> so was this young Charmer called: I was extreamly well pleas'd to find I could a-new take fire;

and though at first it seemed to be very strange and improbable to feel a Passion for two, yet I found it true, and could not determin which I had the greatest tenderness for, or inclina­tion to: But 'tis most certain, that this Night I found, or thought I found, more for <span class="hi">Bellimante,</span> who fired me with every Smile; I confess she wan­ted that Gayety of Spirit <span class="hi">Bellinda</span> had, to main­tain that fire she raised: And ever when I was thoughtful a moment, <span class="hi">Coquettre</span> (who is ever in all the Conversation, and where she appears very magnificent and with a great Train,) would, smi­ling, sing softly in my Ear this Song, for she is ve­ry Galliard;</p><div class="lg"><div class="l">Cease to defend your Amorous Heart,</div><div class="l">Against a double flame;</div><div class="l">Where two may claim an equal Part</div><div class="l">Without reproach or shame.</div><div class="l"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1623"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=23">[Page 31]</a></span> 'Tis Love that makes Life's happiness,</div><div class="l">And he that best wou'd live</div><div class="l">By Love alone must Life caress,</div><div class="l">And all his Darts receive.</div></div><p><span class="hi">Coquettre</span> is a Person, that endeavours to please and humour every Body, but of all those who eve­ry day fill her Train, she caresses none with that Ad­dress and Assiduity as she did me, for I was a new Face, to whom she is ever most obliging and en­tertaining. However, notwithstanding the Advice of <span class="hi">Coquettre,</span> I fancied this young Charmer had in­gaged all my Soul; and while I gazed on her Beauty, I thought on <span class="hi">Bellinda</span> no more; but be­lieved I should wholly devote myself to <span class="hi">Bellimante,</span> whose Eyes alone seemed capable to inflame me.</p><p>I took my leave with Sighs, and went home extream well pleas'd with this days Adventure.

At this time I had abundance of Intreagues upon my hands, for it was not with <span class="hi">Bellinda</span> and <span class="hi">Bellimante,</span> with whom I lived in this manner; and indeed it is impossible to remain at <span class="hi">Intelligence</span> and to make a Court but to two Persons only, where there are so many of the Fair and the Young.

In going, <span class="hi">Love</span> said to me: In absence it is in vain to abandon yourself to sorrow. Alas! What signifies it to sigh night and day; the Absent does not hear us; nor can the most tender Affliction or Com­plaint render a Lover happy, unless the Fair One were present to hear all his Moans, then perhaps they might avail. There was reason in what he said, and I was pleas'd and calm'd; and we arri­ved at the same time at this Village: All the Hou­ses were fine, and pleasant, we saw all the Graces there by Fountains and by Flowery Springs, and all the Objects that could be imagined agreeable; and the least amiable ones, we saw, gave us a Joy! All the World that inhabit there contribute to Di­version; and this place is called <span class="hi">Amusement: Amusement</span> is a young Boy, who stops and gazes at every thing that meets his Eyes, and he makes his Pleasure with every Novelty.</p><p>As soon as I arrived at this Village I thought to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2205"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=31">[Page 46]</a></span> divert myself, as others did; and to hinder my Thoughts from fixing on the loss of my two Mi­stresses, and to banish from my mind the Sha­grins their Absence gave me; withdrawn from the fair Eyes of <span class="hi">Bellimante,</span> and the Charming Wit of <span class="hi">Bellinda,</span> and to give my sighing Heart a little case; upon a thousand Objects I formed my desires, and took a thousand Pleasures to divert my Melancholy: And all the time I lived at this dear place, I passed my time without any inquie­tude; for every day afforded me new Objects to give me new Wishes. And I now expected, with­out much impatience, the return of <span class="hi">Bellinda</span> and <span class="hi">Bellimante;</span> nor did I tire myself with writing to 'em every day; and when I did write, to save the expence of thought, the same Billet served both; a thousand little tender things I said of course to both: And somtimes, especially while I was wri­ting, I thought I had rather have seen them than have lived at <span class="hi">Amusemcnt,</span> but since it was necessa­ry they should be absent, I bore it with all the Patience I could; somtimes we were in a fit of writing very regularly to one another, but on a sudden I received no Letters at all; the reason of this was, they both understood I lived at <span class="hi">Amuse­ment,</span> and had retired themselves to the Palace of <span class="hi">Spight:</span> I no sooner received this News, but I rendered myself there also; it is a place where there is alwaies abundance of Tumult, Outrage, Quarrels and Noise: And <span class="hi">Spight</span> is a Person who eternally gives occasion of Discontent and Broil; causing People often to fall out with those they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2247"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98886&amp;page=31">[Page 47]</a></span> love most, and to caress those they hate: But the Quarrels she occasions us with those we love, last but a very short season, and Love reconciles those differences that <span class="hi">Spight</span> obliges us to make: Thô 'tis somtime pleasant enough to see those we Love extreamly, and violently, fall into the highest rage, and say a thousand things injurious and un­reasonable, and to swear all the Oaths that angry Love and Fury can inspire, never to see or con­verse with one another again, and in a moment after to grow calm, weep, and reunite; to be perjured on both sides, and become more fond than ever they were.</p><div class="lg"><div class="l">A Lovers Rage and Jealousie</div><div class="l">One short moment do's confess:</div><div class="l">How can they long angry be</div><div class="l">Whose Hearts are full of tenderness?</div></div><p>In this Place there wou'd be eternal War, but for a person who inhabits there, and is always the Mediator for Peace, tis he that assists to accommo­date and bring the Lovers together.

I confest to you that my <span class="hi">Coquet Cupid</span> advis'd me not to go, for fear of attaching myself too much to a place so extreamly agreeable; the Mountains, that inviron this Castle, are very high and full of hollow Rocks, which made the scituation very sullen. The Castle itself was delicately built, and surrounded with tall Trees, so thick that one cou'd hardly see the Edifice, nor cou'd the Sun-bearns dart throw the gloomy shade; and eternal Night seem'd to sit there in awful state and pleasure: For the more obscure this place is and secret from all Eyes, the better and more acceptable it is to all that enter there, and thô this Vally have many inhabitants, it appears to have none at all; because they love solitude, and, banishing all Publick society, con­tent themselves only to be but two in company together, if there be more they are receiv'd with a very ill welcome, for a third Person in this place wou'd destroy the Pleasure and the harmony. The Inhabitants of this Castle never shew them­selves but to those that are very importune, and then not every day, the Ladies that command there are many Sisters all of the name of the Castle; and all very fair, and still one more fair than the other, and when you visit'em you see'em not all at once but by degrees and the last you behold is the fairest, and by the pleasure you have in seeing one, you desire to see'em all.
