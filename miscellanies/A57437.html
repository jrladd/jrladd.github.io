ENCREASE.</span></h2><p><span class="decorInit">T</span>He principall advantage wee have over all the world besides is thought to be our shipping, which with our owne materialls as yet we build at home: but if Tim­ber continue still to decrease, we must not onely bee beholding to others for it, but have no more ships than they will give us leave; And yet the Hollanders who have no Timber at their owne growth, doe farre surpasse us in number of ships, so that were it not for the courage of our Nation, under God, and our expertnes in Sea-fights, other Nations perhaps up­on triall might at least bee troublesome to us, and that the Hollanders have some hopes thereof may bee well conjectur'd by the great diffi­cultie wee finde in prevailing with them upon all occasions of their profit; as particularly in the fishing businesse, the East India trade, and daily diminishing the Marchant Adventurers ancient priviledges in their jurisdiction to the great prejudice of this State: And if the Hol­landers eve<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> in our memory thus sprung up not without our assistance and welwishes, and the French of la<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e so strong, both in the Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, as that w<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e can scarce set out such Fleetes as either, how much more dangerous will their puissance bee to our po­steritie? certainly it is considerable for both of them, especially the Hollander is more likely, and hath better meanes still to advance him­self continually more and more hereafter, than he had at first to get to what he is at present: for it is not the large territories in the Low Countreyes, but their trafficke which doth enrich them, the first ground of all their strength and greatnesse; and yet their trade con­sists onely in fishing on our Coast, manufactures and trafficking for­raine commodities to and fro, which so much the more is by them still pursued, as they daily encrease in shipping and riches.</p><p>Thus doth it too too well appeare how other States and Princes will daily grow more and more rich and powerfull, and consequently after the same rate in a short time of foure sufficient to give Chack­mate unto us: The onely meanes I finde able to prevent this shame and miserie are two.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e732"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=5">[Page 2]</a></span>One by endeavouring what is possible that our trade may bee enlar­ged wherein we have advantage over all the world, as I will show hereafter, and particularly by setting our selves close to the fish im­ployment.</p><p>The other, in procuring that other States and Princes rest contented to keep only such a number of men of warre as may not make us with just cause suspect their strength and force; neither is this course disso­nant to reason, or without President or present practise, for if the levy­ing an Armie of men by a neighbouring Prince give just jealousie, how much more may a Fleet of ships which cannot bee without men e­nough to make an Armie of at pleasure besides the capacity of condu­cing an other where they please? And even in this matter of shipping &amp; maritime forces, the States of Italie are so precise and strict, as that the Pope himselfe, Kingdomes of Naples and Sicilie, Grand Duke, State of Genua and Grand Master of Malta keepe onely so many Gal­lies as are limited to each by generall consent amongst themselves.</p><p>But in regard the Hollanders may alledge it necessary for them to have continuall Fleetes at Sea to defend themselves against the Spani­ards, it may be as necessarie for us to importun<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> the King of Spaine to make an honourable peace with them; or, if he refuse, to joyne with the Hollanders and share with them in the bootie, for if we sit still, and they goe on conquering as is like enough, the more they get, the lesse able (if they please) shall we be to keep our selves from being con­quer'd too at last, and living at others mercie, would at best bee but dishonourable, when if wee fare well, wee must conne them thanks and not our selves: Let us not then runne a farther hazard subjecting our selves to remaine betrai'd in the end by our owne flatterie: did wee but consider the ods wee had of other States in Sea-forces but halfe an age agoe; and now reflect upon the great Fleetes they make both in the Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, we may finde their power such at Present, as may render them justly to bee suspected of us here­after, and unlesse wee show our selves sole Soveraigne of the Sea, and with our Trident Scepter give lawes (whilst we may) to all Nations there, wee must receive them from others, when wee cannot helpe it: Forraine Nations teach us the truth hereof alreadie by fishing in our Seas whether wee will or no, and the French in disturbing our trade the last yeare in the Mediterranean Sea, and enacting lawes prejudi­ciall both to it and our Navigation, which of themselves are able to beat us out of trade in time, and so much more, when Christendome shal be at peace, by which means the trade of Spaine will be free for o­ther Nations which at present as it were we Monopolize to our selves, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e767"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=5">[Page 3]</a></span> and our Cloth<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ers and other Manufactors in swarmes flocking over into Holland to enjoy their liberties, (which God knowes how justly) but whether it bee true and due libertie, or only so suggested, it is equally dammageable to this State, since it causes their depar­ture, and the ill consequences ensuing thereupon; it concernes us therfore (and that suddenly) to prevent others by good usage, get those backe againe that are gone, or hinder the progresse of their art and manufacture, which else both may, and justly too, bee counter­mined.</p><p>And whereas it may bee inferred by what I said before, that the enlarging of our trade would keep us still predominant over all other States and Princes, I will set downe some few indigested Notions to­wards the producing and continuing a flourishing State of commerce, which if wee doe not seriously apply our selves unto, other States will questionlesse bee too hard for us, and whatsoever trade they beate us out of and engrosse into their owne hands, will feede us with a bit and a blow, making us pay for it what they please, which will not only impoverish us, but ruine our Navigation, and subject us to become a prey at pleasure.</p><p>Briefly then the trafficke of England may be divided into Inland, and Maritime.</p><p>Inland is that which is practised from one towne or place unto an other within the Countrey, and by</p><p>Maritime I meane such as is used from any part of England be­yond the Seas, which later is chiefely to be enlarged three manner of wayes, by Exportation, Importation, and Transportation.</p><ul><li class="item">1. By Exportation and venting our Native Commodities, as Lead, Tin, Waxe, or such others, as have little or no workemanship, but chiefely those that require and set a worke our Manufactures, as died and dressed Cloth, Perpetuana's, Sayes, Serges, and the like.</li><li class="item">2. By importation of forraine commodities which wee any wise stand in need of, as Wines, Sugars, linnens, wrought silkes, but es­pecially such as imploy the poore in manufactures, as Cotton Wools, raw Silke, and all such sundry materialls as advance our Navigation, Provisions of all sorts, and Ammunition.</li><li class="item">3.

To the first then, which is the granting priviledges to sundry Townes and places, especially Sea Townes most commodiously situa­ted for Fishing, trafficke and Navigation, since London is not onely populous enough, but likely still to be much more even till its owne greatnesse prove a burden to it, for wee see both house rent, provisi­ons for victualing of all sorts, firing and other grow continually ex­cessive deere, the consumption whereof being so great, in so little a circuit, causes them to be fetched so farre off, as the very portage of some of them exceeds the first cost, whereas if such others as are likely still to flocke to London if not prevented, were wonne to settle themselves about Marchandizing in some other place or Port, these provisions would be neere hand to them, and consequently better cheape: Besides it is no policie for a Prince or Kingdome to have so great a multitude, or proportion of their wealth and strength in one place, how strong soever, because if pestilence come amongst them they infect one another; if dearth or scarcitie of any thing necessarie, they are apt to mutiny; if warres they may bee besieged, and then so farre from helping, as they helpe onely to sterve one another, and what is no lesse considerable, their overballancing number and riches, were it not secured by the untainted loyaltie of those Cittizens, and as well ordered by their good government (whereof wee have often seene experience) might be a temptation of ill consequence; Where­fore to prevent this, as also not to venture all wee have, or so great a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e888"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=7">[Page 6]</a></span> part of it at one st<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ke, and disperse and multiply trade throughout the whole Kingdome, it may be requisite to endow some Sea Townes, es­pecially with sundry priviledges, and immunities; but first they must be si<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>uate where they may have all provisions cheape, and advance somewhat thereby of what they would have spent in London; then they should bee such as have secure Ports and Roades capable to re­ceive and harbour ships of all burthens; next it is necessary they bee fortifi'd with strong walls and ditches, if a Castle bee not thought sufficient to protect the Inhabitants, and people of all sorts encoura­ged to dwell there by such meanes as may <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>est prevaile with them: as first by a free trade to pay little or no custome, especially for goods outward, or such inward as are to bee againe exported; then if need require they may be furnished with house-rent free for some yeares, and hopefull men of good report, who living there so far off, will perhaps finde no credit, with moneyed men in London should be ac­commodated with competent summes at a low interest of about 4. <span class="hi">per</span> 100. for where men have moneys, they will continually be plod­ding how to imploy them <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t, and so make new discoveries in trade to the future inriching of Prince and Countrey together with them­selves. And whereas at present all England, at least Scotland and Ireland for the most part are furnished with forraine commodities brought first to London, then wi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>l these sundry new Townes and Staples of trade as they encrease, not only bee able to provide them­selves, but the Country also that lies neere them with the same at better rates, and yet prejudice London very little, because, as I con­ceive, the greatest part of that Countrey, and such as come to inha­bit there, made shift before to live without them, most whereof were more superfluous than necessary; and were it onely to make these new Townes of Staple Magazines and Warehouses of Corne, Wine, Salt, Fish, Flaxe, Cotton Wooll, Tobacco and other forraine commodi­ties, to furnish our Northerly neighbouring Nations, we may com­passe it with the same advantage which others doe and better, if wee use but the same policie, following our fishing, and providing for our shipping.</p><p>2. The second way to enlarge trade is by bringing downe inte­rest to 6. <span class="hi">per</span> 100. at least, for Interest is the rule by which wee buy, sell, and governe our selves when wee are to imploy our moneys both in building, planting, trading, &amp;c. as thus: A Marchant buying a commoditie to send abroad or bring for England, calculates what it costs, and what it is likely afterwards to sell for, &amp; finding it may pro­duce 8. or 10 <span class="hi">per</span> 100. concludes this is more profitable than interest, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e954"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=7">[Page 7]</a></span> and therfore resolves not to put out his money at use, but imploy it in trade, &amp; having no money of his own, is contented to borrow, because he perceives he may likely advance by this imployment to pay the use, and reserve a convenient profit for his paines, which certainly would not succeed so often if Interest ran higher, for if that bee a more pro­fitable and secure way of thriving, such as have moneys will decline trade, and put it out to use, and those that have none, either quite forbeare to borrow, or undoe themselves with interest at so high a rate: Neither can any thing materially bee objected against this bringing downe of interest, save that strangers will not send their moneys hither to be put out at so low a rate and so abridge the trade, but to this may well be answered, it were good they brought none at all, being better to have a little trade with a greater profit to bee divided amongst our selves, than a larger trade with lesse benefit on it, and that chiefely to goe to strangers.</p><p>But for our owne usurers, whereas it is ordinarily alledg'd how this course would make them call in their moneys and buy lands, it is as easily answered, how all the land in England is bought already, and if any one that hath bought resolve to sell againe, surely it is not with intention to keepe the money by him in a chest without fructi­fying, so that let whose will buy or sell land, be the interest brought downe to what rate soever, our money'd men will not long be <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ullen, but so much money as is in England will bee traded with by those that owe it, or put out at interest at five or six <span class="hi">per</span> 100. when men must give no more for it, since <span class="hi">dulcis odor lu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ri,</span> something hath some sa­vour.</p><p>But true it is that land will bee the de<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rer for it, and perhaps at first Corne, Wools and all kinde of victualing and manufactures the like, which if it bee granted, I hope wee should in conclusion finde no worse effect than that Husb<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ndmen would hereby be brought to a frugall dyet, or stirr'd up to become more industrious setting their wits and hands a worke for improving of the soile, wherein que­stionlesse they come short of other Nations, and might thereby well advance in the great encrease of yearely fruits whensoever their Farmes come to bee enhanc'd; And yet me thinks in saying if landes be improv'd to thirty yeares purchase, Corne, Wools, &amp;c. will rise accordingly, there is a fallacie which captivates many mens un­derstanding, for surely hee cannot be justly said to buy land at thirty yeares purchase, who racking the rent of what it was before squeeses his Farmers after the rate of twenty yeares, which if the Land-lord do not, the Tenant will have no cause to demand de<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rer for his Corne, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=8">[Page 8]</a></span> Wooll &amp;c. and impossible it is that Land should rise unlesse interest money fall; for whereas it may bee objected the scarcitie or store of money will raise or bring downe Land, it is by no other meanes than raysing, or bringing downe interest first: and besides the Far­mers upon all occasion are likelier to discharge a rackrent by multi­plying the fruits thereof through industry, tha<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> raising of the price, for that would onely teach us to be furnish'd from abroad, which if wee cannot doe as well as other Nations it were pitty but wee wan­ted; Spaine, Portingall and Holland, have very little Corne of their owne sowing, and yet eate as much bread as we doe; the Hollander <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ath no Sheepe to sheare, and yet makes cloath as good cheape as England, so that if wee cannot enjoy the advantages we have above them, let us at least be contented to far as they doe, and bring downe interest to the same termes, whereby trade may florish as it doth with them. And if trade bee but encouraged by giving priviledges to our decay'd fishing Townes, and practising what is proposed here follow­ing, I suppose it may appeare there will not only bee suddenly found money enough to d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ive the present trade, but that wee are farther ca­pable to become the wealthiest Nation in all the World. And whereas I made transportation, which is the furnishing of other Nations with forraine commodities, the third meanes of enlarging maritime trade, unlesse we can have moneys here at interest as cheape as forraigne Na­tions, or else advance some other way what wee pay more than they doe for use money, they will keepe us from that trade and the bene­fit of it, for if they can undersell us three or foure <span class="hi">per</span> 100 which is a competent gaine for a halfe yeares imployment, wee may bee sure not to thrive amongst them, but desert a project so advantagious as the Hollanders have not such another to live upon; and to conclude this point, since the lawfulnesse of putting money out at interest is so much controverted, it might be no small motive to us at least to put the use of it at a lower rate.</p><p>3. The third consideration was lightning of our Customes, in imposing whereof heretofore perhaps the chiefe aime and intention sometimes was to increase his Majesties revenues, but speciall care ought to be had therein by lightning our native commodities which will cause a greater exportation of them, and charging it on the for­raine which will hinder their importation, and yet they too sele­ctively not all alike; and here it is worth remembrance that a great part of forraine commodities brought for England are taken in bar­ter of ours, and we should not have vented ours in so great quantity without taking theirs, for wee must not expect to bring away all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1038"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=8">[Page 9]</a></span> their moneys, and our commodities not much more necessary to them than theirs to us: but Cotton woolls, Grograine yarne, Gold and Silver-thrid or Wire, raw Silke and such others which with us are imployed in sundry Fabrickes and Manufactures setting our poore people a worke should bee lightly charged, especially for such a quantity of those manufactures as are againe exported: But Sattins, Taffeties, Velvets and such others as have their full workemanship abroad should bee well charged, which hindring them to be brought in in such abundance, would imploy our owne people in making the same sorts at home, but this must bee done with caution, and by de­grees insensibly, least it become countermined: And though this may seeme, or doe lessen the Kings Customes for the present, it will after be recover'd againe infallibly encreasing trade, and a little Custome upon a great trade is equivalent to a great custome on a little trade, and the people employed and multiply'd to boote which are both the strength and riches of a Kingdome, and yet other meanes (if need be) may be thought upon to countervaile this lessening the Kings revenues in the interim. Provisions of victualls, especially corne, Butter, Cheese, which are the poore mans food, who hardly advances more than will cloath and feed him at ordinary rates, should be free of all such charges; Wine perhaps may deservedly pay good custome, since wee may bee without it, at least the abuse is great in so great consumption of it, and a heavie custome may hinder the importation thereof in part, but the Subject will still be the more deceived in it, unlesse it bee severely prohibited for Vintners or others to mingle and sophisticate it, or sell one sort for another, by which mea<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es notwithstanding the greater customes, they may put a lower price on it to intice their Cu­stomers.</p><p>To charge Jewells as Diamonds, Pearles, Rubies and such like su­perfluous ornaments with great customes, would scarce hinder the im­portation, for since the custome may be stollen with so much ease, ma­ny would be tempted thereunto, desiring to advance no more than the stolne custome, and to search mens pockets and their breeches exact­ly (for otherwise as good no search at all) may perhaps bee thought against the liberties of this Nation, I am sure much contrary to their humour. Besides Jewells are wealth and riches in a Kingdome and consequently good credit to it, which though, if they were so much money, might be imploy'd better and improved, yet certain­ly they are a treasure, and in case of necessity may sted a Kingdome, and will only abound after that a Kingdome aboundeth with wealth <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1062"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=9">[Page 10]</a></span> and money, the superfluitie whereof is onely converted into Jewells, and such other riotous expences.</p><p>And whereas sundry Statutes have formerly beene alledged for rating both native and forraigne commodities, now that wee are in time of Parliament which hath power to make new or repeale the old, mee thinks we need not so much oblige our selves to what passed here­tofore in this behalfe, as to examine whether there bee the same rea­son for rating this or that commoditie, and encrease or pull down: the customes accordingly: wherein two things may well bee aymed at; first the raising a revenue to the King, and secondly to produce a flou­rishing state of traffike to the Kingdome, and as the former must not bee forgot, so may the latter bee found of such necessitie as that with­out it both King and Kingdome ere long will come far short of the re­venues and abundance which hitherto they enjoyed; wherefore our dri<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t must primarily be to enlarge trade.</p><p>Since then two Nations carrying cloth or any other wares unto a market, the best cheape will out of doubt sell soonest and thereby eate the other out of trade; and in regard a necessitie lyes upon us to finde out vent and issue for our severall manufactures and commodities whereby the poore people may continually be kept a worke, if this be not to be compassed by selling cheaper than hitherto we have done, &amp; that Marchants cannot possibly sell cheaper unlesse they be eased in the customes, certainely there may arise not onely a conveniencie, but a peremptorie necessitie that it bee so for preventing greater mis­chiefe.</p><p>Wherefore when setling the booke of rates be seriously considered of and weighed, it may in all likelihood appeare that some native commodities and manufactures will justly require the freedome of all customes and such like charges, and others especially forraigne for as good reason to be charged double, whereof if one ballance the other, the revenue will bee the same as formerly, besides the encrease in gene­rall which will undoubtedly attend a well ordered State and Gover­ment of trade; but if by this meanes the wonted revenue should for the present be impayred, that may be raised by multiplicitie of other, meanes, each wherof would be lesse burthensome or dammageable to the Body Politike, than any course how plausible soever, which proves an obstacle to trades enlargement: wherefore I must crave leave to presse this farther, and say I suppose there will be found up­on due enquirie, necessitie of freeing broad cloath and some other Woollen manufactures from all or the greatest part of customes unlesse <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1094"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=9">[Page 11]</a></span> wee can keepe other Nations from making the same sorts, or be con­tented the vent of ours should continually decrease, untill we be quite beaten out of it by forraigne Nations, who could not thrive so well therein, unlesse they had been able to undersell us, I wish therefore it may be throughly thought on and in due time prevented.</p><p>Yet for the decay of our Woollen Staple in some Countreyes wee cannot remedie it by withdrawing our customes and other charges, unlesse we prevaile with those states that they not only not impose new duties, but pull off such as are of latter times imposed contrarie to our ancient priviledges in their jurisdiction, and the Royall trea­ties and capitulations on Our States behalfe with Theirs respective­ly, wherein if I should particularize, it would appeare very notori­ous how in some Countreyes our cloath and other commodities have exceedingly beene burthened, purposely to keepe us from bringing them thither, and encreasing the manufacture thereof amongst them­selves, which succeedes so well with them, as if wee bee but a little longer contented with it, for what concernes redresse, we may for ever after hold our peace.</p><p>Yet if such advantages may be layde holde of betweene States and Princes in amitie and alliance, and wee as ready to practise them as they, perhaps others might be glad to beginne a <span class="hi">Palinodia.</span></p><p>Would the Hollanders take it kindly that wee forbid them fishing on our Coast and drying their netts on our shoare? would those of Brabant, Flanders, &amp;c. to whom reciprocall trade and intercourse is of greater consequence like well it were withdrawne? can France drinke all the wine she makes, or heare willingly a bill of banishment against her babies and such like toyes for exporting no little summes of golde and silver yearely? If wee prohibite the importation of Cur­rance but a yeare onely which costs us 70 m. pounds Starling ready money, would not the State of Venice see wee can better live without them, that their subjects of Zante and Zafalonia without bread, or eate currance in lieu of bread? and yet, poore people! they have no other shift; surely then if wee knew our own strength, they might well bee induced to let us have them upon moderate conditions without multiplying the custome and other duties in such prodigious manner as now they come to exceed the very cost and principall it selfe: We have not five thousand pounds worth of trade with them in a yeare besides these currance so dammageable to our selves, and for our friendship, however they regard it, it is of good consequence to them▪ in that the greatest part of their woolls from Spaine, and the rest from <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1120"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=10">[Page 12]</a></span> Constantinople is most commonly brought in English shipping, which if they come short of, our own cloth may find so much more vent in Barbarie and Turkie; I purposely forbeare to enter upon o­thers, these few will evidently demonstrate our abilities to play with other Nations at their owne weapons, if wee bee provoked there­to.</p><p>But some commodities there are which should not be reported nei­ther with, nor without Customes saving upon mature deliberation, as Ammunition of all sorts, Timber, cordage, Pitch, and all other materialls of shipping and Navigation, which may in time offend our selves; yet when wee have advance, and it is probable our Neighbours, (nay very enemies) will have them from other parts, then had wee best serve them, and get the benefit thereof, whereas otherwise they will through necessity seeke out and bee able to provide themselves elsewhere, wee loosing what wee might securely have advanced, and perhaps be farther prejudiced in the consequences thereof: As in the transportation of Iron Ordnance whereof wee might have furnished all the world, but holding them at so high a rate taught the Ger­mans, Danes, and Swedes, to finde meanes and make them better cheape at home to this Kingdomes dammage above 20 m. l' <span class="hi">per annum</span> besides the imployment of so many people. And certainly there are Offices which in Christianity wee owe to our very enemies, much more our Christian neighbours, and Protestants most of all (which makes mee wish even with zeale and servencie the Hollanders procee­dings and carriage towards us were such as might not make them jea­lous of us in this or any other respect) the omission whereof in us God Almighty knowes how to punish even with <span class="hi">Lex talionis</span> if hee please; yet I thinke we are not the only sinners in this kinde conceaving that Nation uses their utmost art against us and all the world besides in this respect, the French having likewise of late yeares much encroach'd herein: And it is remarkeable how our Tin not long since being rai­sed from Duckets 16. to Duckets 26. in Legorne, and other forraine parts proportionably, a mine of Tin is lately found in Barbarie from whence quantity being brought for Italy hath pull'd the price of ours back-againe to about Duckets 16. as it was heretofore, and may per­haps finde the way to France, Turkie, and other Countreyes too, hereafter.</p><p>And in furnishing our enemies with provisions and ammunition defensive or offensive me thinks there is a policie not a little conside­rable, in that they being fitted from time to time by us at a mode­rate <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1153"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=10">[Page 13]</a></span> price makes them live securely and seeke no farther, expecting to have it brought unto them according to their custome, in which case if for our advantage at any time wee have just cause to denie it them, it is very likely we may supprize them on a sudden before others not being used thereto can bring it them▪ or they perhaps bee able to provide themselves elsewhere.</p><p>4 The fourth meanes is by increasing and improving our new Plan­tations in the Westerne Ilands and encouraging to others; this is a matter of exceeding great moment enlarging both our Dominions and our Traffike; if people of good report and ranke could be prevai­led upon by immunities and priviledges to bee the first Inhabitants in any new discoverie, certainly the businesse through their orderly and good government might succeede more prosperously, but for want of such it were farre better there were power and authority given to take up all beggars both men and women throughout these King­domes and send them for some of the new Plantations, all delinquents for matters which deserve not hanging, might bee served so too with­out sparing one of them, and all such persons in the meane time bee kept in houses for the same purpose, and forced to worke or starve, untill the time of the yeare and ships were ready to carry them away; and as these might likely doe better there, betaking themselves to get a living, so should wee not onely free the streetes and countrey of such rascals and vagrant people that swarme up and downe at present; but prevent many others, some, whereof are successively borne and bred so, the rest brought to the same begging lasie life by their ill ex­ample, and a great summe of money saved, which uses yearely to bee given to such vagabonds to no purpose but to make them worse through the encouragement they have to continue so by our misled charity and daily almes.</p><p>But of all other Plantations that of New found Land may deserve to be furthered, not only in regard of the fertilitie of the Iland re­ported to bee great, but also for the more secure and commodious prosecution of our fishing trade on those banks, in which imployment a dozen of men only in a few moneths time are able to improve their labour to farre greater advantage, than by a whole yeares toile in til­ling of the ground or any handicrafts mysterie whatsoever: and this leades me to</p><p>5.

Clothes died and dressed, it is certaine we cannot continue the trade in the future with any profit for above halfe that quantity, especially since wee must likely forbeare those Countrey Cotton-Woolls which used to furnish us for returnes, being now served with better cheape of our owne plantation in the Westerne Ilands.</p><p>But for my part, I shall not thinke our selves secure of any trade or ought wee have, which the craft or power of Neighbouring Nations shall any wayes bee able to beguile us of, and therefore most earnest­ly doe wish, wee may, whil'st that we may, endeavour to establish our security and trade upon our owne foundation, and that must bee our fish imployment, able to beget and draw after it all trade besides, being the Schoole and Nurserie of Marriners and Navigation, and briefely a Treasure more rich, and in sundry respects to be preferred before the Spaniards in the West Indies, whose store with Gods bles­sing will continually encrease as often as the Moone, whose influence so much predominats those Creatures, and though another King­dome of fish should bee discovered, such Nations as are situated neere us, will bee necessitated to feed on ours: What pittie is it then that so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1208"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=11">[Page 15]</a></span> many fishing Townes alongst our Coast should bee decay'd, nay what ignominie and bad goverment to pay and maintaine Strangers for ta­king of our owne fish? Certainely if ever wilfulnesse or negligence of not improving a Talent in this World bee punished hereafter, ours will bee inexcusable; My purpose is not to enlarge since others are better able, and I cannot so much as think seriously thereof without a profound disturbance and vexation to my selfe, whil'st I revolve in my mind the greatest carelesnesse that ever men committed, saving that some of our Predecessours did the like, and our successours will doe no lesse, for all that I can doe; and therefore had best desist to tor­ment my selfe in raysing spirits, unlesse I could againe alay them.</p><p>Wherefore I will only say, if wee doe not get into our owne ma­naging the greatest proportion of the fishing trade, our trafficke will not onely decline, because it cannot otherwise bee the greatest, and that (as the greater fish the lesser) hath capacity to eate out and de­voure the rest, but the very sinues and strength of the whole King­dome, the onely ground worke whereof is trade and commerce, will bee shaken and quite ruined in the end, at least whatsoever State else shall enjoy it, will keep us at their mercie; and therefore if wee either want moneys, men, knowledge to catch and cure the fish, or ought else to establish this only Pillar of our future wealth and safetie, let us either prevaile with other Nations by waiges and faire meanes for their assistants, or not suffer any of them to fish on our Coast, save such as will come and inhabite in our Sea-Townes with their wives and families, making themselves free Denizens and depositing such a por­tion of each voyages profit in a secure Banke for that purpose which shall punctually pay them and their children if neede bee the interest, and restore the Principall unto their Grand-Children, who may then bee thought quite naturalized and not likely to depart the Kingdome, or else such Boates whose men unwilling to dwell amongst us may bee permitted to fish, so they take halfe English marriners and Adventurers in the voyage of whose returne for England we are also to be secured.</p><p>And since our Soveraingnty on the Seas is so evident, and the pol­licie of State for our security permits us not longer to neglect it, mee thinks our neighbouring States and Princes should not interpret a­misse, if they refusing these or the like offers (without which hereaf­ter we shall not possibly be able to continue and maintaine our juris­diction) we doe with utmost rigour totally forbid them fishing;

The sixt is the restoring of our Woollen Staple, and this must bee by seeking to export the greatest quantity wee can of Woollen goods dyed and dressed in their full manufacture, as also by setling such a course as the Officers who are only to seale the cloath if it hold in length, breadth, good spinning &amp;c. may not passe it over so care­lesly more regarding their fees than the care belonging to their Of­fice.</p><p>For the first, I know the enterprize was made many yeares since in seeking to send nothing but dyed and dressed Cloth into Germany and the Low-Countreyes, and how prejudiciall it proved to us in teaching them to make cloth of their owne, rather than bee so stinted by us, and since chiefely in Holland by imposing dayly new taxes and customes upon all our Cloth spent there both white and cullour'd, but if at that time in a quiet way wee had onely taken the Custome and charge off from the Cullour'd and by degrees put it upon the white still raysing it insensibly, it might in all probability have done the feate, the cheape collour'd beating the deere white Cloth quite <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1309"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=13">[Page 18]</a></span> out of service, and for present wee can onely make this use of it, that unlesse wee give our Cloth both white and colour'd at cheaper rates than they make theirs of the same goodnesse, wee must looke quite to loose the trade.</p><p>But for the searchers of the Cloath that it bee compleat in all the perquisites, mee thinks it might well be compassed; and it is of great consequence, for the Marchants here in England who deale for great summes and quantities cannot looke so precisely on every Cloth, examining of it end for end, and when it comes beyond sea hee that buyes it can only see the muster and the outside, receiving the great­est part of it upon trust and publique faith which Marchants deale more in than for readie money, and afterwards perhaps it may bee sent hundreds of miles farther before it bee opened, or the defects knowne untill it come to bee measur'd out; Wherefore this charge and care of searching and sealing all Woollen goods may very well bee intrusted to the next towne where the cloth is made, and they imploying whome they please to receive the benefit, for their behoose, may bee obliged to utmost dammages and penalties upon every over­sight therein committed.</p><p>And for Fullers-earth, Woolls or any other materialls which con­duce to cloathing wee must not onely forbeare to carry them our selves, but hinder others what we can from doing so.</p><p>7. The seventh is the encouragement of all manufactures at pre­sent practised in England, and bringing in of new, which is of wonderfull consequence and benefit especially to a populous com­monwealth, in regard it sets multitudes of poore people a worke, who thereby maintaine their wives and families in good order, which otherwise might bee burdensome, and perhaps starve. These manufactures are one maine cause hath made the Hollanders so nu­merous and brought them to this greatnesse, wherefore in imitation of them we<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> ought to cherish all those that are already setled, as Weavers of Woollen and Silke stuffes, Weavers and Knitters of Silke and Woollen stockins, with which latter a pretty trade hath former­ly beene driven but almost quite declined since our last warre with Spaine, during which time through want of ours, they began to make them in the Countrey improving it ever since and thereby with the great customes upon ours at home bereaved us of that trade; so as when wee loose one, if wee bee not ingenious to get another in­steed thereof, wee shall bee stript of all at last: The very varying and new fangling of manufactures is considerable, causing them to finde <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1338"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=13">[Page 19]</a></span> vent both at home &amp; abroad as they happen to please the fancie of those Nations to which wee send them; and if such as set their wits a work herein were taken notice of, and rewarded by such a commission or peculiar standing Magistrate who should have the superintendencie over all trade and trafficke many would likely be encouraged by the credit of it, but gaine would provoke all; And the same Magistrate to punish all abuses in manufactures of what sort soever either in personall or penall mulcts ⅓ whereof to go unto the King▪ ⅓ unto the Magistrate and ⅓ to the Informer, who if he so desire, is to be concealed.</p><p>Weavers then of all sorts of linnen both fine and course are to bee invited out of France, and the Low-Countreyes, and Wal­loones and other French, both for making of lighter and finer sorts of Wollen stuffes, and are generally farre more ingenious for inventing of Laces, Buttons, and what else is deem'd requi­site to the accomplish't apparelling (so thought at present) <span class="hi">à la mode,</span> wherein all Europe speake true French though not the same Dialect, for where all use not the selfe same fashion, yet they varie theirs as much as French: but these Laces and Buttons may perhaps onely helpe to encrease our owne ex­pences at home, and are scarce likely to grow exportable into forraine Countreyes, where out Woollen commodities are chiefe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>y requested because good cheape.</p><p>The multiplying of salt, but chiefely making it with salt water deserves likewise particularly to bee continued and che­rished, not so much for imploying many people, but that wee cannot well passe without it, being as necessary to us in a man­ner as is our meate; Our fish imployment cannot subsist with­out it, and the preserving both of fish and flesh the chiefe suste­nance of our long voyages and Navigation, so that if possibly it may bee compassed, and made in England to bee afforded here­after when brought to full perfection at the same or somewhat a higher price, than wee used to bee served at from abroad, questionlesse it will bee good pollicie rather than expect it from others who will denie it us in greatest neede, and wee found both unskilfull and unprovided of most of the materialls to furnish us therewith; yet somewhat wee may pay more for this, since as it is said the flesh and fish cured with this salt eates more pleasant, and besides making it our selves wee shall not onely have it at a constant price which before did much va­rie, rising and falling exorbitantly as more or lesse store came <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1373"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=14">[Page 20]</a></span> from abroad, which was so much the more hazardous, in regard many ships brought it only when they could get no other im­ployment, thereby telling us there was no gaine in it, and wee cannot expect men will bring it us to losse: But the importati­on thereof being continually prohibited, and freedome for all to make it in the Kingdome, where and when it may bee most for their advantage, I conceive they may have Ware-houses and Magazins up and downe the Countrey, to conserve it in, and afford it all yeare long at such a rate as may be for our common good and benefit. And surely it may serve us for a Maxime of direction in all such like cases, that whatsoever is necessary or so usefull, as probably wee cannot bee well without it, wee should by all meanes possible seeke to secure our selves of it within our owne jurisdiction without being subject to the mercie and re­liefe of others in our greatest miserie and distresse &amp; thus stand­ing upon our owne foundation what ere befall other parts o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Countreyes of the world, we may not onely still remaine the same amongst our selves, but be Arbitrators of their welfare also.</p><p>The making of Cabells and all manner of cordage is likewise considerable, for which cause the groweth of Hempe in our Kingdomes might bee encouraged and may well hereafter bee more practized because it sets many a worke, and being so in­separable to navigation with many others, which are all to be furthered by priviledges and immunities to the workemen, es­pecially the new Inventors and Promotors, and the materialls which are thus imployed in manufactures to be imported with little charge and custome, to the end the Marchants and Manu­factors may finde a competent gaine and make a trade of it.</p><p>By this meanes the Hollanders who have little of their owne growth to feed upon, cloath, or promote Navigation save butter and cheese, have yet such store and provision of corne, wine, fish, shipping, ammunition, and all other things necessary and deli­cious, as their owne naturall wants are not onely aboundantly supplyed, but severall other Provinces of larger circuit than their owne replenished with their store to the great wonder of the world, in that they having no materialls conduceable to shipping can build, sell ships, and let them out to fraight, chee­per than any other Nation.</p><p>8. The eight is making England the <span class="hi">Emporium</span> or Warehouse from whence other Nations may bee furnished with forraine commodities of all sorts, and this may likely have effect, if such <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1408"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=14">[Page 21]</a></span> forraine wares bee not onely exported free of charge, but most of the duties which were pay'd at their importation bee resto­red againe, especially if a Denizen brought them in, and carries them out againe, wherein the chiefe rule to governe our selves must be by ordering it in such manner as that we may furnish o­ther Nations with them full as cheape as they can have them el<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ewhere, for this is a maine engine wherewith some people advance themselves and hinder others.</p><p>This transportation and serving other Nations with forraine commodities is of greater benefit and cons<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>quence to some States than the exportation of their owne, and yet in this wee are equally with them capable of the same imployment by rea­son of our situation, nay some of our Sea-Townes where these Magazines may be raysed, and Marchants invited to inhabit, lie more neere severall Neighbouring Provinces than they, and whereas some Countreyes during the Winter season have their ships often kept in by ice some moneths together, we may from hence put out all windes and weather, and a ship at Sea seldome but advances somewhat towards her Port: Besides the Hollan­ders having no native commodities to follow the Turkie trade, and by reason of the Algier Pyrates so much infesting, and the Spaniards no little awing them at entring in and out the straights, they are quite driven out of it, so that were it well ordered we might serve them, and the French too (bought out of the turkie trade by us in cheape-selling of our cloth to our owne losse) with all manner of Turkie commodities, Cotton-Wools and such others as come from our Westerne Plantations, and upon dearth of Corne, or scarcity of any other thing, wee providing to furnish other Nations, and keeping their Ware­houses as I may say in our Kingdome, shall not onely not want our selves, but bee furnished far better cheape than they and ne­cessitate them to have continuall dependency upon us.</p><p>9. The ninth is the promoting of the East India Trade, which however hitherto dammageable to those that followed it in particular, yet upon due search and estimation will bee found wounderfully considerable, the rather because those Ter­ritories being so vast, farther discoveries of new trades might be expected dayly, as well for venting of our owne commodities as importing others at cheaper rates, if that society were better countenanced at home and not so grievously disturbed abroad, the Hollanders in policie of State have reason to desire nothing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1436"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=15">[Page 22]</a></span> so much as to weary out and constraine them to abandon it, which unlesse it bee prevented, wee may justly feare will take ef­fect, being to be observed and collected by the proceeding of the <span class="hi">Amboina</span> businesse that nothing will bee left unattempted, for full accomplishing whatsoever may farther advance their strength and profit.</p><p>And although at present the Flemmings carry little of their spices into the Straights, because they sell them better neerer hand, as also in regard the Pyrates of Algier doe oftentimes make prey of them, &amp; so much raise the insurance as they thrive not in the trade, yet if wee suffer them to beate us quite out of the East Indies, we must not only loose the trade wee drive in o­ther parts with the advance of India Commodities, and pay deere for what wee spend our selves, but when ere this come to passe, being then stored with spices, Callicoes, and other East India wares, enough to serve all Italie, Turkie, and Barbarie, which so soone as they begin to practise, the rest of our trade in the Mediterranean Sea will then as fast decline, the Hollanders cheape fraight being able of it selfe to eate us out in time with­out any other Stratagem or plot.</p><p>Wherefore there is no longer time for dallying, wee must whilest wee are able make our owne lawes and conditions, still keeping our selves so mucst more stronger, as no Nation may ever have power or ability to spurne against us: and for to war­rant and encourage us in executing of it, we have not onely the maine ground and pollicie of the State to keep Neighbour­ing Nations from growing over powerfull, especially such as above others are more subtill and forward to offend us, when craftily and securely to bee compassed; but too too just cause of revenge have wee against the Hollanders for their unheard of cruelties and injuries done us in the Indies, whereof we have re­quired justice and restitution in so milde a manner, as taught them hitherto onely to sleight and put us off, by which proceed­ings though the East india Companie being wearied out for want of the States protection and assistance should bee prevailed upon to receive an inconsiderable despicable allowance holding no proportion with their wrongs, because they can get no more at present, yet I hope his Majestie will never passe it over in such manner, as may enbolden them to attempt the like againe: None admires their industrie more then may selfe, or desires their good successe, but with the same charity reflecting on our selves <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1459"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=15">[Page 23]</a></span> at some, desire withall wee may rather bee alwayes able and willing to aide them, than ever neede, or have necessity to be aided by them.</p><p>But vaine it is for us to thinke or study the enlarging trade, un­lesse we prosecute the East Indian with all might and maine; for if trade must chiefely bee advanced by Exportation, Importation, and Transportion as I said at first; That of Importation we generally ex­claime against our selves, and justly too for being so great and overbal­lancing our Exportation as is objected that brings us so farre in debt, as nothing but our moneys the blood of traffike will satisfie; and of Exportation what can wee farther hope from it hereafter? hath not all the Cloth we vented from North to East of late yeares beene sould to losse? Certainly our Marchants will make it plainely appeare they cannot live by the trade at present, nor yet hope to sell at better rates in the future, unlesse we send out lesse; so that both Exportation and Importation must bee lessened that trade may bee inlarged, al­though it seeme a Paradox: This you'le say is a deplorable Estate and yet it is ours, and we must make the best of it, or fare the worse our selves.</p><p>We must not only bee contented but really lessen our Importation and consumption of forraine goods at home, nor rest there neither, but resolve to doe the like for Exportation sending out losse Cloth hereafter, and this is not all neither, but wee must lade it as little as may be with customes and other charges, else all other Nations almost who have already begun to make Cloth, will be able to undersell and beate us quite out, so that a Master-peece it would bee, it possible, to give them so good cheape abroad, as others might not make to live by it, and then both our Wollen-Weavers and other manufactors that so unkindly left us, may happily returne againe, and such as have been taught by them doe the like, through discontinuance become unapt, or at least in time both one and other spin out their owne thrid too; when, and not sooner, may we expect to sell more quantities of cloth at better prices, which then, and not till then, may safely be inhanc'd, nor without due pollicie and discretion to prevent the like severall disa­sters into which through our inconsiderate proceedings we finde our selves plunged at present: But if I (like a hard-hearted Chi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>urgion that unmercifully torments a Patient in searching and lancing of his wound, and afterwards uncharitably leaves him without applying a soveraigne balsome for to cure it) doe here conclude, I should not only faile of my intention and pretention in this foregoing discourse, which was both to demonstrate a Possibilitie and meanes of trades in­largement, but be justly censurable for anticipating our miseries, re­presenting <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1483"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=16">[Page 24]</a></span> them all at once to the publicke view in their most dire­full and maligne aspect, whereas their naturall motion will onely o­vertake us by degrees.</p><p>Since therefore the exportation of Cloth our most staple commo­dity, and importation and consumption of forraine wares must be di­minished, to make good what I intended towards the enlarging our trafficke notwithstanding, the remainder of our Stocke, People, and Labours, which of late heve beene imployed in making more Cloth, and bringing in more superfluities than wee could well digest, must necessarily bee set a worke some other way, and this may not onely have effect by practising new manufactures, Fabrickes, and the fishing imployment, but also by transportation to our farre greater benefit and advantage: Now nothing can bee imagined so much to further transportation as the prosperitie of the East India trade, wherefore as it is not safe for us to part with any Countrey trade how small soever, because the wealth and welfare of this Kingdom may justly be measu­red by the Kingdomes traffick, so least of all may we forgoe this of the East Indies, which though at present in vents not our native commo­dities in such quantities as Germanie and Turkie, yet the money we save by furnishing our selves with Spices, Callicoes and other India wares at moderate rates in great abundance, and yet send larger store out againe to other Nations, and the good hopes and likelihood wee have to multiply this trade in all dimensions, may render it so consi­derable, as that if Marchants by their former ill successe, through the Hollanders unbrotherly proceedings, should not be found to prose­cute it, his Majestie and whole State have just cause to keepe it up though it were to losse at first, and if all meanes else faile, moneyes levied for maintayning it, cannot bee so grievous and prejudiciall to these Kingdomes, as the losse of it would likely bring poverty and ruine on them in the end.</p><p>For though the pres<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nt Companie being dissolved, it is like enough that many particular Marchants will adventure by themselves, for what will they not adventure? yet if the Hollanders can counterminde a whole society, that had so great a stocke, so well setled, so well gover­ned abroad, &amp; full likely to be countenanced at home, what may then be expected from ordinarie private Marchants who have no successi­on, perishing one by one in their Individuals?

Besides, there is another kind of Bank in <span class="hi">Florence,</span> which is called <span class="hi">Il giro</span>; as thus, Every three moneths the Merchants of <span class="hi">Florence</span> chuse one amongst themselves of best credit, who is to be (as it were) the generall Cash-keeper of all moneyes de­livered, or taken by exchange, for that present Faire; the manner whereof you will finde explaned at large hereafter, so that what moneyes bee delivered, or drawne by any man during this Faire, the sayd generall Cash-keeper makes him Debtour or Creditour, turning the slyd summes over from one to the other, provided hee be such a man as hath money in his Cash, and at three moneths end hee makes up his Cash, payes everie man his owne, and the Merchants choose another for the next Faire, or three moneths following.</p><p>Now if the benefit and conveniencie of these Banks are thus enjoyed in <span class="hi">Tuscany,</span> where the Prince is so absolute; but with­all, his Treasurer and other Ministers so punctuall in payments and other dealings for the Princes peculiar service, as no Merchant can be more; for which cause Merchants hold it more secure, and seek rather to deale with them, than with the best meere Merchants like themselves: Why may not we, under so pious and gracious a Soveraigne, in a Kingdome founded and established upon such wholesome Lawes, expect the like good successe from a Banke in <span class="hi">England?</span> For being so exceedingly beneficiall both to King and Countrey, as would daily still more and more appeare, wee may easily beleeve it should bee furthered and cherished by both; the rather since it may bee setled and credited by Act of Parliament, with command that neither principall nor profit shall bee stirred or employed, save for their account, according to expresse order &amp; direction of the Trienniall Parliament, whereto onely such as over­see and manage it, may be made accountable, if so thought fitting.</p><p><span class="hi">And as it may be observed amongst Merchants and prodigall Spend-thrifts, that such as are bad Pay-masters, or of little credit, can neither <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1784"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=19">[Page 37]</a></span> buy, sell, or bee entrusted to such advantage as others are: So is it doubtlesse with Princes and their Ministers that are not punctuall in their dealings; for in delaying payments, the verie time unto a Mer­chant eats out eight</span> per centum <span class="hi">in a yeare, besides the inconveniencies which may befall him by being disappoynted, and this verie justly too, is so fearefull unto most Merchants, that those few as are more ad­venturous, will not deale with such Ministers of Princes as are bad Pay-masters, but upon such odds as must needs bee an excessive dam­mage to the affaires of those Princes; and yet this cannot well be reme­died, untill the cause be first removed; for since gaine is that which all, especeally Merchants, doe chiefly aime at, it might be justly thought in­discretion for any one in buying, selling, or any businesse of like nature, to refuse the more punctuall Pay-master, and take the lesse at the same price: and how much his Majesties affaires have suffered in this kind, such as were employed in them doe best know. But for my part, I may be bold to wish they be managed hereafter with such credit and punctu­alitie, that which formerly was lost for want thereof, may be hereby re­gained: more may, though net well so publikely, be sayd on this subject, and the consequence of it, both for the private benefit and publike well­fare of his Majestie and Kingdomes;

but having neither ready money to disburse for the present, nor credit to be trusted at time gives this Mercers bond of an hundred pounds unto whom he sold his silks, in payment of the <span class="hi">Perpetuana's,</span> and so is still doing something, whereas otherwise having no other estate but this hundred pounds, hee could not have traded againe, untill those twelve moneths, were expired, and the Mercer payd him his 100 pounds: but if this course be once made secure and currant, it will in the same manner as the Bank before spoken of, add lively­hood unto Trade, and encrease the stock of the Kingdome▪ for what concernes traffiquing with it, so much as these Bils turned over amount to: when a man that hath neither money, nor credit to be trusted at time, may yet follow trading with the debts that others owe him: In this case a b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ll of debt (which likewise may be in print) must be made by every one that buyes commodities paiable to such a one, or his Assignes, or Bearer therof, &amp;

by which meanes a man of credit may be furnished with what summes of money he pleases at an in­stant, and pay them in againe the weeke following, or when hee will; which accommodation costs such as make use of it in those parts where 'tis ordinarie somewhat more than downe-right in­terest.</p><p>The originall of these Faires, as also the unnaturall use of Exchan­ges grew thus: Divines in former times continually exclaiming a­gainst Vsurie, which those of the <span class="hi">Roman</span> Church doe still to this day, voting it a mortall sinne, to take whatsoever the least benefit or encrease, by expresse agreement for the use of money, pressing it uncessantly upon the consciences of their Penitentiaries, such as having store of monies, though they found no more beneficiall, certaine, and easie way of imploying them than downe-right in­terest, which they could not get absolution for from their Ghostly Fathers, were forc'd to set their heads a work, and so invented, or rather adulterated the true and most laudable use of Royall Ex­changes in two respects: one was, that Vsurers observing how in all Exchanges, as namely betwixt <span class="hi">London</span> and <span class="hi">Venice, &amp;

But if there be more De­liverers than Takers; that is, more monies to be delivered by Ex­change from <span class="hi">London,</span> then returned by Exchange to <span class="hi">London,</span> and that all yeare long, and for many yeares together, as hath beene most certaine in respect of <span class="hi">England,</span> with forraine parts, doubt­lesse the few Takers will have more opportunitye to stand upon their termes, in bringing the Exchange downe in their advan­tage by so much undervalutng of our monies: And though this be very obvious to any mans apprehention, yet it may be made fur­ther appeare so; thus:</p><p>'Tis then first presuppos'd upon good ground as you have heard, that the undervalving of our monies by Exchange is prejudiciall to such as are deliverers of money by Exchange in <span class="hi">London,</span> and takes by Exchange abroad.</p><p>Secondly, that these Takets abroad, and Deliverers here at home are strangers, is likewise presum'd; and</p><p>Thirdly, that out of the sale and provenue of our goods exported there are great summes of mocey returned hither weekly from a­broad will as easily be granted.</p><p>Now since this undervaluuing our moneyes by Exchange is one­ly dammagable to the Deliverers at home, and Takers abroad, and both these are strangers, why doe strangers deliver here in <span class="hi">England,</span> and take abroad by exchange thus to their losse? certain­ly nothing but necessity can force them to contiuue losers all yeare long for sundry years together: nor can there be any necessitie, had they not such store of monies, which they must necessarily deliver here, and that in far greater quantitie than wee have return'd us from abroad by sale of our goods exported.</p><p>So then if it be granted, as well it may, that strangers have more monies to send away, than we have to bring into the King­dome, though a Table of Rates were established as is propoun­ded, yet strangers would have the same or greater encouragement some times to export monies in <span class="hi">specie</span>; for whereas at present the Exchange being favourable to the Takers at home, and Deli­verers abroad which are Euglish, the English are moved through <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3475"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=31">[Page 60]</a></span> gain to take a good proportion of those mo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ies which the strangers must necessarily make over by Exchange, or send away in <span class="hi">specie,</span> for they have occasion to use them in other Countries: But this Table being setled in dammage and prejudice of the Takers at home, and Deliverers abroad being English, the English will forbeare to take at home, or deliuer by Exchange abroad, so that whereas stran­gers did form<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rly export onely a part of their monies, they will now be constrained to convey away the whole: wherefore I will onely adde, that though this Table be setled for Exchanging, yet since there may, and that likely enough, as great necessity befall strang<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rs to export monies notwithstanding, it will be altogether as requisite to practice exactest diligence alongst the Coast, and strictest penalties for preventing exportation of them; and if it prove by this meanes to be secured, then may this stinting Table be verie well forborne, in that the sting lies in the exportation of our monies, and the undervaluing them is the benefit of the Eng­lish, who are the Takers at home, and Deliverers abroad, and by the low Exchange at home, and high Exchange abroad enabled to sell their Cloth so much better cheap, and consequently, ven­ting the greater quantitie, at last win the whole trade from other Nations.</p><p>Since then as the scarcitie of every commodity makes it more to be esteemed, and yet money through want or plentie raises or deminishes the price of all things; in same manner doth it pre­dominate the Exchange; for as the Takers and Deliverers of mo­ney by Exchange doe over-ballance one another, so doth the Ex­change rise or fall accordingly, as is demo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>strated by daily exp<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> ­rience; and strangers being found thus replenished with monies to cause the undervaluing of our <span class="hi">species</span> by Exchange, if to ripe judgements and understandings it appeare so prejudiciall to the State o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> is alledged, which for my part I doe not as yet apprehend, (though I confesse it invite the exporthtion of our monies, since diligence may reclaime it in the greatest part) certa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nly the onely remedy must be to take away the cause, which furnishes them with such store of monies, and that is by preventing the great Revenues they make of interest monies in <span class="hi">England,</span> which continually they draw from hence to furnish their occasions, no otherwise than e­verie man doth for receiving of his Rents in one Countrie which hee intendeth to spend in another: and secondly, by raising the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3536"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=31">[Page 61]</a></span> customes of strangers goods, especially inwards, both <span class="hi">Spaniards, Germanes, Italians,</span> and those of the Low Countries, all so much as may keep the<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> from boinging in such quantities as formerly.</p><p>Others are of opinion, the exportation of our moneys might be hindred by raising them in <span class="hi">Denomination,</span> or embasing the allay; but if other Princes doe the like, wee are still where wee were: besides, this would encourage many private Mint-Masters in <span class="hi">England,</span> and Strangers to bring it from abroad, though not alto­gether so much as brasse money, yet povertie and ruine would be the end of it; but had this latter motion taken effect, and greater <span class="hi">Species</span> beene once made currant, what through counterfeiting at home, and importing from abroad, it would in probabilitie so ex­orbitantly have encreased, untill brasse kettles had beene more worth than brasse money, by how much the workmanship of ket­tles is more costly.</p><p>Then would a full period have beene put to trading, and no dea­ling or exchanging heard of, save barely to suffice nature, and so re­mained untill the brasse money had ceene called in againe, which then must needs be gr<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>wne so common, as not esteemed or accoun­ted a reward worth working for.</p><p>But if this over-ballancing of trade were granted, and merchan­diz<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ng exchange found to bee so dammageable to the Common-wealth as is alleaged▪ since certainly they cannot be well preven­ted otherwise, it will serve exceeding appositely to enforce the bur­den of this discourse, which is: <span class="q">‘That unlesse the fishing imployment and <span class="hi">East India</span> traffique be followed and enlarged, other Nations will gaine upon us, our trade infallibly decline daily, and the whole State with the same speede and paces post on to poverty and utter ruine.’</span></p><p>What greater encouragement can possibly bee expected? The treasure of the fish employment is knowne to yeeld millions yeer­ly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3602"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=94293&amp;page=32">[Page 62]</a></span> (by our permission) unto others; and from the <span class="hi">East Indies,</span> be­sides the venting of our owne commodities, bringing in their Spi­ces and others hither, and the trading up and downe in the Coun­trey, to exceeding great benefit, wee may in time hope for all silver and gold that ever came out of the West, or any other parts; for into <span class="hi">Turkie</span> we have seene it carried daily, thence for <span class="hi">Persia,</span> and other Easterne Quarters, but never returne back againe.
