Robin.

WEll met my loving Brother Jack,

mind what I ſhall ſay to thee,

My Mother tells me that I lack

a Woman to wait on me:

She tells me I'm big enough now for a Wife,

And therefore muſt alter my Batchelor's life;

But I am afraid of care, trouble, and ſtrife:

O Charges, Family-charges,

makes me afraid to wed,

Jack.

'Tis like you are loath to take a Bride,

becauſe that the Times are hard,

Pray caſt ſuch careful thoughts aſide,

and never ſuch things regard:

For if you can live now when ev'ry thing's dear,

Why then Brother Robin, I'll make it appear,

In times of full Plenty much Moneys you'l clear

O marry prithee now marry,

Joan is a pritty Girl.

Robin.

I am not ſure that honeſt Joan,

will marry with me I ſwear;

For ſhe to ſuch a height is grown.

that if I by chance come there,

And Proffer to kiſs her, ſhe'll turn her about,

And then with her Fiſts ſhe'll batter my ſnout,

Till bloud from the ſame came trickling out:

O marry, if I ſhould marry,

How will ſhe ſerve me then?

Jack.

'Tis like you did not compliment,

and give her a kind Embrace;

But like ſome clowniſh Booby went

with Hat hanging o'er your Face;

And it may be, your Shoes and your Stockings unty'd,

You look'd like a Lover that want [...] a Bride;

For ſome ſuch like Reaſon ſhe liquor'd your hide

O Robin, Anniſeed Robin,

is it the truth or no?

Robin.

Believe me as I am a Man,

true Breeding I there expreſt;

And as you know full well I can,

I went in Apparel dreſt.

My Grandfather's Hat, and my Calve's leather-cloath [...]

Then into her preſence I merrily goes,

And made her a Congee quite down to my Toes;

yet Joaney angry Joaney

kickt me about the Room,

Jack.

You ſhou'd have told her what you had,

to bring a young Woman to;

This would have made her Heart full glad,

without any more ado

With Kiſſes thou ſhould'ſt have ſaid, If thou'ſt be mine,

Why then all my Capons, my Turkies, and ſwine,

And every thing elſe that I have ſhould be thine:

Then Robin, Anniſeed-Robin,

you wou'd have gain'd her Love.

Robin.

I was not wanting to declare,

my Riches to her at Large,

And how I was my Fathers, Heir,

ſure I could maintain a charge,

And told her, that I had a Cow, and a Calf,

And ſomething likewiſe that would make her to laugh,

As large, and as long as a Conſtables Staff:

yet Joaney, Paſſionate Joaney,

kickt me about the Floor.

Jack.

Go try your Fortune once again,

and never be daunted ſo;

Her love you may at length obtain,

for Laſſes are coy you know:

But after a while they ſurrender and yield,

For Love is a thing cannot be conceal'd,

And you may be Lord of the conquering Field,

then Robin, tickle her Robin,

ſhe will at laſt be thine.

Robin.

To take your Council I'll nor fail,

but to her I'll go once more,

I'll give her Cuſtards, Cakes and Ale,

which I did not do before;

I'll ſpend a whole Shilling, and when it is done

It ſhe will not love, me as ſure as a Gun,

I'll call her young Whore, and away I will run:

ſo leave her, utterly leave her,

never come there again,
