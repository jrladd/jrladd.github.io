I left my home and sayled to <span class="hi">Cipres,</span> there found I men vnknowne, but not her whom I lookt for: there might I sée <span class="hi">Venus</span> Pallace like the gor­gious Tower built by <span class="hi">Semeramus.</span> Sloth being Porter, sléepy, and suffering frée passage to all, the gate of entrance was not the way to returne: for at the other side was a doore to depart, where Beggery stoode and threatned all, but strooke some with his whip of repentance: within I found Princes, great Lords and men of meane calling, al prisoners, some fettered by the eyes, others by the eares, some by the tong, as hauing more lust in their mouth then loue in their mindes, none or fewe cheyned by the harts, and such as were set inthroned in a secret Cell: those <span class="hi">Ve­nus</span> shrinde vp as wonders of the worlde, well: missing what I came for, I past spéedily from thence to <span class="hi">Paphos,</span> where <span class="hi">Venus</span> had onely a Temple, thither came multi­tudes on Pilgrimage, making vowes, vttering oathes, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e318"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3564&amp;page=5">[Page 2]</a></span> and protesting promises: if they might enioy the fruition of their Ladyes, to be sworne votaries to the Goddesse: Some were fauoured, others disgraced: some dispaired, some hoped, but all found the ende of theyr pilgrimage was to buy smoake with many perrills and daungers: But all these instances were no arguments to diswade me from my iourney: But as <span class="hi">Medea</span> though I saw the best and allowed of it, yet I followed the néerest &amp; smar­ted for it, for such as be in loue are like the Déere which one while strike at the Tamarisk trée with their hornes, and then gréedily burst on it with their mouthes, others the people of <span class="hi">Mamaca,</span> that surfet on Dates, and yet dye with them in their mawes.

from the secret temper of the graces nature, bestowed more prodi­gally vpon women then men, as creatures more worthy and excellent: the richest gold hath the rarest colour, the purest stones are most cleare, the sweetest Flowers most pleasing to the eye: and women as the purest quintissence circolated from all other liuing things, are therefore the most beautifull and faire: yea in their own sex, beauty is the touchstone of vertue, and y<sup>e</sup> fairer a woman is, the ful­ler of good conditions: for such as nature hath either slipt ouer with negligence, or made in her melancholy, so that they are ill fauoured and deformed eyther in face or body: such I holde as a principle to be counted stigmaticall, as noted by nature to be of a bad constitution: then must we confesse that beauty is excellent, as the pride of nature: deuine, as fetcht from the Gods: glorious, as the delight of the eye: pleasing, as the content of the hart: and to be estéemed aboue all things, as the very couer and superfi­cies vnder which vertue lyes hid: if then men séeing such heauenly obiects, such swéet Saints, haue their eyes fixed, their minds fettered, their thoughts inchanted with their loues, are

some such satiricall copes-mates▪ that spare not to raile against them, calling them the imperfection of nature, saying beauty is vanity, and the signe of little honesty, noting women as waspish,

swéete and simple soules: they be pleasant, open harted, far from deceit God wote, as bearing all their owne secrets both graue, and yet ha­uing many mad and merry tricks to pleasure men, hum­ble &amp; lowly, submitting themselues to what their friends will lay vpon them: constant, as neuer to be turnd from their opinions: kind enough, and to be short, as full of ex­cellent qualities, as the
