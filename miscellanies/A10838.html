For to obteyn licence of the Bishop is to obteyn pub­lique authority of the publique officer, and according to the publique lawes, of the church, to excercise a publique ministery. 2. The great Turk is a lawfull civill Magistrate in his Dominions, with whose civill au­thority it is lawfull to partake: but so is not the Byshop a lawfull Eccle­siasticall officer in his Province or Diocesse, with whose spirituall jurisdi­ction Gods servants may communicate. And is this to <span class="hi">lead men by the hand,</span> to take for graunted the mayn question in controversy, to wit, that the Bishops jurisdiction in their Provinces &amp; Diocesses is lawfull: which I have also by sundry arguments proved vnlawfull, &amp; antichristian.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note20">Act: 9.</span> Surely they who suffer themselves thus to be <span class="hi">led</span> must be as destitute of spirituall sight, as was <span class="hi">Saul</span> of bodily, when men <span class="hi">led him by the hand to Damascut.</span> Theyr authority then being proved (&amp; so confessed by this myne oppo­site els where) antichristian,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note21">Rev. 18. 4.</span> &amp; so consequently one of <span class="hi">the sinns of Babylon;</span> whether excercised by themselves or by others; eyther Officials in the Cō ­sistories, or ministers in the Parochiall churches, may <span class="hi">not</span> by <span class="hi">Gods peo­ple be partaken with,</span> no not in actions though otherwise lawfull, under the peyn of <span class="hi">Babylons plagues.</span></p><p>And this answer also serveth to the 4<sup>th</sup> demaund,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note22">4 Qu: Ans.</span> or <span class="hi">Supposition</span> of <span class="hi">this persons takeing besydes his licence, the form of admission called orders, of the Dioce­san.</span> And so, that which I bring pag: 15.

But .1. I deny that an assembly gathered, &amp; consisting of <span class="hi">many fearing God,</span> &amp; many (which must also be supplied) without the fear of God, is a lawfull Church-assembly, haveing a right in communion, or common right, to call, &amp; en­joy a pastour, &amp; his pastorall administrations. 2. I deny that any doth, or can truely take a pastorall charge in the parrish assemblyes. It belongs to the pastours charge not onely to teach, &amp; minister the sacraments, but also (&amp; that as a mayn parte, or duety thereof) to govern, and <span class="hi">rule the flock:</span> which no parochiall minister doth, o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> can take vpon him.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note25">Act. 20. 17. 20 1 Thes: 5. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1 Tim: 5. 17.</span></p><p>3. The Church of England; doth acknowledge no such <span class="hi">calling</span> as is <span class="hi">cheifly grounded vpon the peoples choyce:</span> but onely that which is groun­ded vppon the Bishops ordination at the first, and to the ministery at large: and determinately, eyther uppon the Bishops license, or vp­pon the patrons presentation, Bishops institution, and Arch-deacons induction, confirmed by the publique lawes of the same Church, both ecclesiasticall, &amp; civill. According to which publique lawes, and orders (especially submission vnto them being publiquely professed and given, as is by the minister here deciphered) we are to judge of the publique mi­nistery of the Church, &amp; not according to the private intendiments, and vnderhand professions of particular persons. And let God, &amp; all reaso­nable men judge between me &amp; myne opposite, whether a man goeing to the publique governers of a Church, &amp; desyreing of them a publique of­fice, or publique orders, &amp; so receaving them according to the publique lawes of the same Church, &amp; therewith authority to preach the word, &amp; so preaching publiquely in the same Church, whether I say such a man be not to be esteemed as called to that work by these governers; &amp; so by cō ­sequence, whither al men pertakeing with him in that work of preaching for which he was so sent, do nor partake therin withall what in them lyeth in the authority of the sender. And for such a man (except he have pub­liquely renounced his former calling) to pretend in secret vnto his freinds whom he dare trust, &amp; who, he thinks, will agayn trust, &amp; beleeve him, ey­ther <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e708"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=4">[Page 6]</a></span> that he preacheth not by that calling, or by an other principally, is but to put on a <span class="hi">cloak of shame,</span> &amp; to <span class="hi">walk in craftines,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note26"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Cor. 4. 2.</span> more like in truth to a disguized familist, then a minister of Iesus Christ. And if any ministery grounded, as this man supposeth, be to be found in any of the assem­blyes, I deny the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ame to be the ministery of the Church of Englād, about which our question is. And howsoever men do build much vppon the peoples acceptance of, and submission vnto theyr ministery, yet is this a very sandy foundation wherevpon to build such a weight. If they be not the lawfull ministers of those Churches before, it is theyr syn to <span class="hi">accept</span> of them,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note27">Rom: 15. 31 Heb: 13 17</span> &amp; <span class="hi">submit</span> vnto them, as such. The peoples acceptance, and sub­mission are not causes, but consequences of the ministers calling, &amp; due­tyes, which they ow vnto them all theyr life long. 4. The <span class="hi">supposition</span> is but an imagination, that any parochiall minister doth <span class="hi">administer the sacramēts onely to such as are, in charity, &amp; discretion, to be esteemed worthy.</span> He is by his parochiall cure (&amp; shew me the man whose practise is not answerable) to administer the sacrament of Baptism to all the infants born in the par­rish, though neyther parent can, no not in the most enlarged, if <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ot over­stretched <span class="hi">charity,</span> be judged to be of the fayth, &amp; so in the covenant of A­braham; according to which covenant Baptism is to be administred. Last­ly, I would know of this man (&amp; so of others who would bring the pres­biteriall government vpon the parrish assemblyes without a separation) what should be done with such men of years in the parrish, as are to be e­steemed vncapeable of the L: Supper. It should seem, as the common o­pinion is, that such should be suspended, &amp; so consequently (remayning obstinate &amp; incorrigible) excommunicated. But by what law of God, or reason of man, do the Censures of the Church apperteyn vnto such, as had never right to be of the Church, nor were within Gods<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note28">Gen: 17.</span> <span class="hi">covenāt</span> made onely with theyr faythfull, &amp; theyr seed?

But myne answer is, that this man remayning by the prelates ordination a minister of the Church of Engl: &amp; as he was before his institution, or licence, &amp; so preaching by that calling, communion cannot be had with him therein, without submission vnto &amp; vpholding of the Prelates Antichristian authority, which in that work he exerciseth.</p><p>Suppose lastly that the s<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>me man doth besydes the good actions which God hath commaunded, admit of some thing at mans commaund, which is not lawfull,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note33">7 Qu:</span> yet houlding the fayth, &amp; building faythfully in the mayn things of the Gospell, and it may be repenting also of what he hath done at his admission: is no communion law­full with him in those very things, which if they were done by another after the same manner were heavenly dutyes? May not his fault be an humayn infirmity, in an externall ordinance? May not some faultes of his enterance be circumstantiall per­sonall actions by which his calling is not abolished.</p><p>This Quaere is in effect comprehended in the former,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note34">Ans:</span> in whose answers it hath also been answered. But for more full satisfaction I further ad; that I may <span class="hi">not partake in the sinns,</span> though <span class="hi">of hum<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>yn infirmity,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note35">1 Tim: 5</span> &amp; of persons other­wise go<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ly: whether those sin<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s be in the work done, or in the vnlawfull calling of the doer: of which we here speak, and not of any personall, or circumstantiall action, as is in vayn insinuated. And he that breaks down the <span class="hi">partition wall</span> which an vnlawfull especially an antichristian calling sets vp in the Ch:,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note36">Numb: 16.</span> not making cōscience of partaking therwith in <span class="hi">duetyes</span> how <span class="hi">heavenly</span> soever in themselves, makes way for all Babylonish confusion: ney­ther is Israel now to be blamed for communicateing with <span class="hi">Corah</span> in the <span class="hi">heavenly duety</span> of <span class="hi">burning ince<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>se to the Lord,</span> to whom onely a lawfull out­ward calling was wanting: he so ministering by an Anti-mosaicall, as do the men of whom we speak, by an Anti-Christian calling.

It remaynes we now come to his removall of <span class="hi">the barrs</span> which I in my book set in the way: the first whereof is, that, <span class="hi">such a parrishional minister is a branch of the prelacy / as receaving power from it / by which it doth administer / and there­fore all communion with it to be avoyded by Gods people.</span></p><p><span class="hi">His answer is, that</span> in proper, &amp; accurate speach the minister, whom he former­ly described, is no branch of the prelacy, nor doth receave his power of ministering frō any prelate.</p><p>The question is not whether the minister which he describeth, or rather <span class="hi">Supposeth,</span> be a branch of the prelacy, &amp; so minister or no: but whether the ministery of the parrish assemblyes, being partes of the Diocesses, and Provinces, be such or no.</p><p><span class="hi">He addeth, that</span> the power of right he <span class="hi">(that is his supposed minister)</span> had be­fore ever he had to do with any prelate, which power is from God by the Church: but a power of externall legall abillity to do that, which from God by the people he had for­merly right to do, this he may be sayd to receav from the prelate.</p><p>He looseth himself in the labyrinth of his own devise: for even his sup­posed minister had to do with the prelate, both for <span class="hi">license to preach &amp; or­ders of ministery</span> before this supposed right conveyed to him by the people, as appears in his Quae: 3. 4. &amp; 5 compared together. 2. None of the par­rish assemblyes have in theyr hands, as Churches, <span class="hi">power of right</span> to chuse theyr ministers, nor are the Lords free people in that case: but do, on the contrary, stand in subjection &amp; bondage spirituall to the prelate, and pa­tron, by whose appoyntment they must receave them, will they, nil they. Indeed some of them do by favour, or mony get <span class="hi">ius patronatus</span> into theyr handes, &amp; so do agree amongst themselves what person they will present vnto the Bishop for theyr Clark: but this they do not as a Church, neither will, or may the Bishop so receave him from them, or appoynt him over them, but as a patron, (which right any one profane person may have &amp; enioy as well as they): nor, that such a person may be ordeyned a mini­ster in, &amp; of that Church,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note37">Act. 6, &amp; 14</span> accordeing to the order Apostolicall: but that being before, or first, a minister at large of the Bishops makeing, and or­deyning, he may by the same episcopall authority, in way of licence, or institution conveyed, be determined to that particular parrish, according to the Popish order. So that if there were any thing in the distinction be­tween <span class="hi">the power of right,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">of freedom,</span> he hath <span class="hi">the power of right,</span> or <span class="hi">authority</span> by the Byshop at the first, in his ordination: &amp; <span class="hi">the legall ability</span> or <span class="hi">freedom</span> af­terwards by the patron, &amp; prelate presenting, &amp; appointing him to his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1059"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=5">[Page 9]</a></span> place: &amp; so the parrish, as a Church onely receaves him so appoynted by others. But the distinction is more subtile then sound: &amp; i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> not a distincti­on without a difference, yet a division of things inseparable in this kynde. No man hath <span class="hi">externall spirituall power of right,</span> to minister the holy things of God, but by a lawful calling: &amp; no man haveing a lawful calling wants <span class="hi">ex­ternal spiritual power of ability</span> or <span class="hi">freedom</span> to minister them: &amp; of this power we speak, as being that which the Bishops as the spirituall governers of theyr Prov: &amp; Dioc: do confer. I know a man may be restreyned by viol<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nce, or other bodily impediment from the vse of this spirituall freedom, but then he is restreyned from the vse of his power of right also. Whosoever hath the one hath the other by the same act, &amp; whosoever hath a lawfull calling, hath both. Of his great mistakeing (vpon which notwithstanding he builds the weight of his answer, both in this, &amp; the former parte of the book) which is that the Bishops Provinciall, &amp; Diocesan authority &amp; ad­ministrations are civile, &amp; derived from the king, I shall speak hereafter.</p><p>He ads that <span class="hi">it cannot stand with my plea, that such a man preaching diligently, &amp; professing that to be his mayn office should in this work be a branch of the prelacy, &amp; d<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>t by his power receaved by him. For. 1. this is not any parte of the prelates power (as he is a prelate) to preach the word.</span> Which he also would prove by an affirmation in my book, which is (though he weaken the evidence of the truth thereof in relateing it) that <span class="hi">the prelates office / and order is foun­ded vppon theyr usurpation of the rights / and libertyes wherewith Christ the Lord in his word hath endowed his Church (the Elders for theyr go­vernment / and the people for theyr liberty) for the calling of officers / &amp; cen­sureing of offenders.

By this mans reasoning theyr office should be founded vppō the wearing of a surplice, makeing a crosse, &amp;c. for these they have power to do, yea not power to leav vndone, by theyr office.</p><p>There are among men many lawfull offices or orders, &amp; those lawfully founded, and yet not so perfitly but that some evil actions are (through humayn fraylty) done in &amp; by them: so on the contrary is the office of prelacy vnlawfull, &amp; vnlawfully founded, and yet not so absolutely, but that the good work of preaching may be and is performed in, and by it. Which preaching being also an inferiour work of that office, and order (which is principally set vp for government): and that wherwith the Bi­shops do litle trouble the Churches, it ma<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> well be excluded frō the foun­dation of theyr office, though a work thereof: (as there are also many <span class="hi">doctrines</span> of Christian religion,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note42">Heb. 6. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> besydes those which are properly called the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1290"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">foundations</span> thereof) &amp; though a work good in it self, yet in the extent of theyr power to preach when and where they list in theyr provinces, and diocesses, exorbitant, and antichristian; &amp; so a parte of theyr usurpation, whether of the foundation, or building, it matters not: a parte of which power they also share out vnto the ministers in theyr severall parrishes.

So also is <span class="hi">ministring the disciplyne of Christ, as the Lord hath commaunded,</span> expresly mentioned in his ordination: &amp; is it therefore a necessary work of the Pa­rochiall minister? or is he any more then the Bishops mans man in publi­shing his court censure? The Bishop also expresly bids his ordeyned one, <span class="hi">Receav the H: Ghost.</span> Doth he therefore so receav it? Or know we not that it is Antichrists guise, and that not a litle advantageable to the mi­stery of his iniquity, to keep the formes of good wordes without the sub­stance of things, &amp; so vnder the name of Christ to subvert Christs truth, and ordinances? I would to God the notorious ignorance, and vtter in­ability to preach the gospell in the greatest parte, by farr, of the parochiall ministers, to the destruction of so many 1000 soules for which Christ dy­ed, did not cry out vnto God, and men agaynst both that Church, Pre­lacy, and ministery, that preaching is no necessary parte, or work of theyr office. There is but one order, or office of preisthood in that church: &amp; how can that be a naturall, or necessary parte of that office, which the most of those officers want, this especially being by the constant practise of the puqlique governers, &amp; according to the constitution, and state of that Church, ministery, and government; the publique lawes thereof also both ecclesiasticall, and civile approveing it; as otherwise, so by appoynt­ing homilyes to be read by such as are vnable to preach.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1350"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=7">[Page 12]</a></span> Such a one the <span class="hi">patron</span> may <span class="hi">present</span> for his <span class="hi">Cl<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rk</span> to any parishonall charge, and may also compell the Bishop, will he, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ill he, to institute him by processe of law:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note43">Quare im­pedit.</span> whom the people also are bound to receav, as theyr mi­nister, &amp; with him to communicate vnder penaltyes civil, and spirituall. <span class="hi">Let Baal</span> then <span class="hi">plead for himself:</span> even the wearing of a surplice, and signeing a babes forehead with the crosse are more naturall, and necessary to the parochiall ministery, considered both in the common practise, and pub­lique lawes, then is preaching of the gospell.

The office it self was the order of Mas-preisthood, &amp; the power derived from the Pope, &amp; popeish prelacy. That the works of preaching, and prayer, performed by many of the parochiall ministers, and also by some of the Masse-preists) may re­mayn, though the prelacy be taken away, (&amp; with it the parochiall preist­hood also) is without doubt; as they do in the reformed Churches, and with vs, where there is neyther prelate, not parochiall minister: but our question is not about some particular workes, as myne opposite makes it, but (as hath been oft observed) about the very function it self, and the power by which it is given, and vsed.</p><p>And for the poynt: since all the ministers of that Church are made, &amp; appoynted by the Bishops authority, take away the same Bishops authori­ty, and how can the ministers remayn the same ministers? Take away the correlative, and the relation ceaseth. 2. Take away the prelacy, and how possibly can such a ministery continue (as is the parochiall) whereof the one of the two partes (though the inferiour) which stands in <span class="hi">fee<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ing the flock</span> by <span class="hi">ruling,</span> shal be vsurped, and possessed by the prelates and theyr or­dinaryes. 3. Take away the Provin: and Dioc: Prelates, and with them the prov: and dioc: churches: and then the parochiall churches as partes of them must fall with them theyr whole: and with the churches the mini­sters, as partes of them. 4 It is not possible that the prelacy being aboli­shed, such an office of ministery (of which office the reader must still re­member our question to be) should survive, as whereof men vtterly vnapt to teach should be capable, as it is with the parochiall ministery. Can such stuffe passe thorough any but Byshops fingers? or will the Lord ever wipe away so much of theyr shame as to suffer any other hands but of prelates, and theyr chaplayns to be layd vppon the heads of such Idoll-preists? Or is it possible that in any other then the Episcopall governmēt the ministe­ry of <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o many zealous, and learned teachers should hang vppon the cop-web of conformity to Crosse, Surplice &amp; such vanityes, &amp; be in daunger every day for refusall thereof to be broken asunder? Can this web be wo­ven by others then Byshops, or of other stuffe then comes out of theyr bowels? Lastly is it possible that in such light of the truth, as now shineth in Engl: all the profane parrish without difference should be compelled to be of the Church, &amp; the minister of them to take charge, as his flock (as the parochiall ministers do): but as the same is a part of the Bishops flock, &amp; well serving for to supporte his lawlesse Lordship?

They are generally, in the Countyes &amp; Shyres where they live, Iusticers of peace, in the same Com­mission with other honourable, &amp; worshipfull personages &amp; thus they sit vppon the bench at Assises, &amp; Sessions: &amp; have authority civil ioyntly with the other Iusticers, &amp; so severally as they, at other tymes, to apprehend, imprison, fyne, &amp; punish bodily, malefactors, according to the common lawes of the land, &amp; theyr office of Iusticeship: and all these theyr admini­stratiōs they perform expresly in the kings name.

Thus they keep theyr spirituall courts by them­selves, &amp; theyr subordinates, Chauncelours, Commissaryes, Arch-Dea­cons, &amp; other theyr officials: citeing men thither by theyr Apparitours; as on the contrary in theyr civil administrations (though in matters ec­clesiasticall) they vse Pursivants, &amp; Constables. There, and thus they sus­pend, depose, &amp; degrade ministers, as at the first they ordeyned, and ap­poynted them: as they also excommunicate, &amp; absolv both ministers, and people as they see cause: proceeding in all these, not in the name of the king, as in the former, but expresly <span class="hi">in the name of God:</span> in &amp; vnto which theyr vsurpation of the name or power of God, &amp; Christ, no communion may be had, or submission yealded.</p><p>And where he affirmeth that <span class="hi">the greatest parte of theyr Iurisdiction</span> (to wit in theyr Provinces, &amp; Diocesses) <span class="hi">is derived from the king, which he might as well perform by other civile officers, &amp; that the lawes of the land do so esteem it,</span> alled­ging to that end S. <span class="hi">Edw: Cook L; cheif Iustice,</span> there is a great mistakeing in the matter. No onely the greatest parte of, but in effect, theyr whole Iu­risdiction in theyr provinces, &amp; diocesses, standes, in theyr ordeyning of ministers &amp; excommunicateing of offenders with theyr apurtenances, &amp; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1665"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=9">[Page 16]</a></span> in theyr contraryes, of the same nature? Now to make the power of ex­communication &amp; of ordination of ministers civile, or these such workes as may be performed by civile magistrates, the king, or others, is to con­found heaven, &amp; earth; &amp; to make <span class="hi">Christs kingdome</span> (whereof these works,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note46">Iohn. 16. 39.</span> in theyr nature, are administrations) to be of <span class="hi">this world.</span> This power of the prelates is in it self, &amp; nature, spirituall: &amp; in the extent of it over an whole Province &amp; Diocese, &amp; all the Congregations therein (to the abo­lishing of the power both of officers &amp; people) papall, &amp; antichristian, Of which the kings civile authority is no parent, but onely a nurse<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> other­wise the king should be not <span class="hi">the d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>fender</span> onely, but the authour <span class="hi">of the Chur­ches sayth</span> in her government, &amp; ministery. Papists have made of Popes kings, by deriveing from them civile governments: and will protestants make of kings, Popes, by deriving spirituall authority from them? And because Popeish <span class="hi">kings</span> have <span class="hi">given theyr power to the beast,</span> shall Christian kings therefore take the beasts power vnto them: which they should surely do in makeing themselves the spring-heades from whence floweth the power of makeing ministers, &amp; excommunicateing offenders which the Prelates vse in theyr Provinces, &amp; Diocesses?</p><p>And albeit for want of the bookes I cannot exactly set down the judg­ment of the lawes in this case, yet may I safely affirm, that they no where derive from the kings civile authority, the power of these spirituall admi­nistrations, but do onely make the king the establisher, &amp; vphoulder civi­ly of this power. The same ecclesiasticall jurisdiction which had been in vse in popery, &amp; a great part of the popish Hierarchy, was confirmed <span class="hi">Eliz: pri:</span> &amp; so continueth at this day: &amp; in vayn men apply theyr industry &amp; ar<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> in the washing of this blackmore.

So for those <span class="hi">corrupt vsurpations, &amp; abuses,</span> which he affirmeth to be <span class="hi">mingled</span> with the Byshops (so seeming vnto him) <span class="hi">civile power,</span> do not the lawes of the land esteem even them also lawfull, &amp; laudable ordinances, &amp; orders? The Arguments therefore from the lawes esteem to the nature of the thing is of no force.</p><p>Now that the prelates Iurisdiction in theyr Prov: &amp; Dioc: is not civile, but ecclesiasticall, &amp; a spiritual externall power, appeareth playnly by these Reasons.</p><p>First where he makes it <span class="hi">civile,</span> because it is <span class="hi">coactive,</span> or bodily enforceing, I conclude on the contrary, that because it is not so coactive, therefore it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1747"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=9">[Page 17]</a></span> is not civile.

Lastly, if the Provinciall, and Diocesan Churches be not true visible Churches (which I suppose is this Authours judgment) I would know how the parrish assemblies being partes of the other, and so partes of false Churches, can any more be reputed true Churches, then could a particular Iewish Synagogue be reputed a true Church, which should have made it self an entyre, and independent body in respect of the nationall Church, and Temple?</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2428"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=7044&amp;page=12">[Page 23]</a></span> But now if any of the parrish assemblyes be thus separated in theyr per­sonall, &amp; church estate, and formed accordeingly (though with defects, &amp; wants) we desire to take knowledg of them, and which they be, that we may rejoyce for the grace of God towards them, and perform vnto them the dutyes of Christian fellowship, as is meet.</p><p><span class="tcpmilestone">II</span> The 2<sup>d</sup> necessary for a true ministery is a fit person,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note63">1 Tim: 3.</span> in whom <span class="hi">ap<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nes to teach,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">vnreproveablenes</span> in conversation is found: even reason teaching that whomsoever God calleth to any estate he fitteth cōpe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ently for the mayn works thereof.
