Againe to teach vs, that the blessed God sheweth mercy to the repentant of what nation so­euer, and pardons them though they bee many. Haec Kimchi.</span> Vpon whose last words I cannot but enter into these thoughts. Could wee looke for a truth from a Iew, or comfort from a Spaniard? And yet here the Spanish Iew affoords vs both: comfortable truth, and true comfort. God will par­don the Repentant, there is a com­fortable truth, and hee will pardon them of what nation soeuer if they re­pent, there is most true comfort. When a Iew thus preaches repen­tance, I cannot but hearken, and helpe him a little out with his Sermon. That as God is ready to forgiue the Repentant of what Nation soeuer, so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2668"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=25">[Page 39]</a></span> for what sinnes soeuer, if they be truly repented. Here, I except the impar­donable sinne, the sinne against the Holy Ghost: which what it is, the Scripture conceales in close words, partly because we should not despaire, if wee fall our selues, and partly be­cause wee should not censure damna­bly of our brethren, if they fall into a sinne that is nigh this, so that not into it. To maintaine the Iewes words and mine owne, for pardon of Nati­ons and of finnes, I haue as large a field as all the Countries and all the sinnes of the world to looke ouer. I will onely for Countries confine my selfe to Niniueh, and for sinnes to <span class="hi">Mary Magdalen.</span> Niniueh a heathen towne, built by a wicked brood, inha­bited by a wicked crew, yet repenting Niniueh is pardoned. <span class="hi">Mary Mag­dalen</span> a manifold sinner, a customary sinner, a most deadly sinner, yet re­penting <span class="hi">Mary Magdalen</span> is forgiuen, The Iew brings me into two christian <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2695"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=26">[Page 40]</a></span> meditations about Niniueh, or into two wholesome Passions: Feare and Hope. God sees the sinnes of Nini­ueh, then I know mine are not hid, this breeds in me feare of punishment: But God forgiues the sinnes of Nini­ueh, then I hope mine are not vnpar­donable: this breeds hope of for­giuenesse. <span class="hi">Col debhaurau she amar le­hareang libhne Adam</span> (saith the Rab­bin) <span class="hi">bithnai im lo jashubhu. All the euills that God threatens to men, are threatned with this condition, if they doe not repent.</span> As before the Iew spake comfort and truth, so here hee linkes comfort and terrour. God threatens euill, there is terrour, but it is with condition, there is comfort. Niniueh finds both in the story, <span class="hi">Fourty dayes and Niniueh shall be destroyed,</span> there is a threatned terrour: <span class="hi">But the Lord re­pented of the euill that hee spake to doe vnto them, and did it not,</span> there is a comforting condition.

Mercy in Iudgement, and Iudgement in mercy. Is there any one that desperatly reiects Niniuehs exhibited mercy? let him feare Niniuehs threatned iudgment, or is there any that trembles at Niniuehs threatned Iudgement? let him com­fort himselfe by Niniuehs obtaining mercy. But in the mouth of two wit­nesses, let the mercy bee confirmed. Let mee take <span class="hi">Mary Magdalen</span> with Niniueh, and as I see in it the forgiue­nesse of a multitude of sinners, so I may see in her, of a multitude of sinnes. Those many sinners pardoned as one man, those many sinnes made as none at all. Saint <span class="hi">Bernard</span> speaking of her washing of Christs feet, saies, shee came thither a sinner, but shee went thence a Saint: She came thi­ther an Aethiope and a leopard, but <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2747"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=27">[Page 42]</a></span> shee went thence with changed skin, and cancelled spots. But how was this done?

And so hee does: but for the Chaldee Paraphrasts fancie, that he <span class="hi">sacrificed on the very same Altar, whereon Adam and Cain and Abel had sacrificed so long before.</span> I referre it to the beliefe of a Iew, who by the Poet seemes to be of a large faith, <span class="hi">Cre­dat Iudaeus apella.</span> Decencie and order was obserued of the Fathers before the Law, for this holy peece of wor­ship.

Now are the Iewes content, and as it ap­peares in their Common Prayer booke, they beseech God to be so too, with prayers without sacrifice, be­cause they haue not now accesse to their sacrificing place. Their distresse (as they thinke it) for this very thing, might teach them that <span class="hi">Messias Na­gidh</span> or <span class="hi">Christ the Prince</span> hath done what <span class="hi">Daniel</span> to them, and an Angell to <span class="hi">Daniel</span> had prophecyed of him.</p><p>Whether the Heathens borrow­ed their custome of sacrificing from the Iewes or from nature, it is not materiall. Sure I am, that the Iewes borrowed some of their abhominable sacrifices from the Heathen: Sacrifi­cing of men is Heathenish, in <span class="hi">Moses</span> his language: yet was this too fre­quent among the Iewes, vsed also in old time by the <span class="hi">Athenians</span> and <span class="hi">Car­thaginians,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2860"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=28">[Page 45]</a></span> as witnesse <span class="hi">Plutarch, Lac­tantius</span> and others: and in these times by the <span class="hi">Indians,</span> as in <span class="hi">Cortes,</span> &amp;c. Of this bad vse (that the Heathen had got) I cannot tell what should be the reason, vnlesse they thought that cru­elty was the best offering, or that their gods were more cruell then mer­cifull. Or this reason may bee giuen. They had learned either from the Iewes, or from their Oracles, or from the Deuill himselfe (who cares not to giue men some light, thereby to leade them to the more darkenesse) that a man should once bee offered, who should appease the wrath of God (as Christ was) and therefore they in re­membrance of this man, did sacrifice men, either to see whether they could light on this man, or els in remem­brance of him till he should come.</p><p>Some condemne <span class="hi">Iephthae</span> of this cruelty of sacrificing his owne daugh­ter; who yet in <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 11. is commen­ded for his faith: <span class="hi">Austen</span> doubts <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2898"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=29">[Page 46]</a></span> whether it is to bee counted Gods Commandement, that hee slew his owne child. But I thinke no such doubt is necessary, since there is no such strictnesse of the words in the text. A Heathen man in <span class="hi">Plutarch</span> when he was told that he must either sacrifice his owne child to such a God­desse, or else his affaires and enterpri­ses would not prosper, could answer, <span class="hi">that he would offer with all his heart such sacrifice as the Goddesse would ac­cept, but that she would desire or would be pleased with the bloud and murder of his child, he could not be perswaded.</span> I am sure <span class="hi">Iephta</span> had reason to bee farre better instructed in such things as these, then any Heathen in the world.</p><p><span class="hi">Varro</span> holds that it was not fit that any sacrifice at all should be offered. His reason in <span class="hi">Arnobius</span> is: <span class="hi">Quiae Dij ve­ri neque desiderantea, neque deposcunt; ex aere autem facti, testâ, gypso, vel marmore multò minus haec curant.</span> For <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2928"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=29">[Page 47]</a></span> saith he, <span class="hi">the true Gods desire not, nor exact any such matter, and those false gods that are made of brasse, mortar, marble &amp;c. care lesse for them.</span> The Heathen man in his owne sense saith truly, for his meaning doubtlesse is, that the Gods that are true Gods are not delighted with this cruelty of slay­ing beasts, nor do they for their owne sustentation or prouision desire men to be at this charge. And so the true God which is truth it selfe, though he commanded sacrifice, yet was it not meerely in respect of himselfe that he did it, any further then this, that men should by this manner of worship, ac­knowledge their submission and humi­lity and obedience to him. For what cares he for beast or bullocke, <span class="hi">since the world is his and all that is in it, Psal.</span> 50.12. And <span class="hi">Lyranus</span> does set downe the speciall ends wherefore God doth command <span class="hi">Israel</span> so many sacrifices.</p><p>As first to weane them from Idola­try: for their seruice of the true God <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2953"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=30">[Page 84]</a></span> required so much, that they could haue hardly any time to thinke of I­dols. And the very beasts they sacri­ficed, might teach them the vanitie of the Idols of Aegypt which they once serued: Slaying of a bullocke, a ramme, a goat, might tell them that the Aegyptians Apis and Hammon which they worshipped in these formes, were but vanity.</p><p>Secondly: by their sacrifices, they acknowledged that they had nothing but what they had receiued from God, and therefore of their beasts, corne, wine, &amp;c. they offered him in thankfulnesse some of his owne.</p><p>Thirdly: these sacrifices were to beare Christ in their minds till hee should come and make a full attone­ment for them. And so saies <span class="hi">Lyra,</span> the very beasts sacrificed, represent Christ, an oxe for patience, a sheepe for innocence, and an ill smelling goat, for his likenesse to sinfull flesh.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2970"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=30">[Page 49]</a></span>A fourth reason might be giuen: that the people standing and seeing these beasts slaine and fired, might re­member their owne deseruings, and call to mind their sinnes for which this beast was thus vsed. Their put­ting of their hands (the right hand saith the Chaldee) vpon the head of the beast, seemes to import some such a matter as their acknowledgement, of their deseruing of that which the beast was ready to suffer, death and fire. Whosoeuer desires to be taken vp with Allegories about this piece of Gods seruice, <span class="hi">Flauiacensis</span> will furnish him: and if he will not do, the Fathers are copious enough, and it may be too much this way.</p><p>The Heathen Mariners in shippe with <span class="hi">Ionah,</span> are said to sacrifice and vow vowes: which the Chaldee helpes out (as thinking the ship and a tempest vnfit time and place for sa­crifice) thus, <span class="hi">they promised they would sacrifice:</span> viz. when they should <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2989"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=31">[Page 50]</a></span> come ashore, and vowed vowes to be­come Proselytes, saith <span class="hi">Iarchi,</span> or to giue Almes to the poore, saith <span class="hi">Kim­chi.</span> Endlesse it were to trace the Hea­thens, and to see how neere or how farre they be to or from the sacrifices of the Iewes.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.17"><h2><span class="headingNumber">17. </span><span class="head">CAP.

I will not stand to allegorize these matters, of the time and manner of receiuing these two, but onely of the things themselues.</p><p>Circumcision giuen in such a place is not for nothing: but in the place of generation, it is giuen <span class="hi">Abraham,</span> as a seale of his faith, that <span class="hi">he should be the father of all those that beleeue, Rom.</span> 4. And especially a seale to him of Christs comming from those loines neere to which his circumcision was.

A whole dozen of them, <span class="hi">Canaan</span> and his eleuen sonnes sit down close together, in, or (at least) not farre out of the small compasse of Ca­naan: where they all differed not, (if any at all did) in language, being seated so nigh together.

In this tong were laid vp the mysteries of the old Testament.

At their re­turne, it was in some kinde repaired, but farre from former perfection. The holy Scriptures veiwed by <span class="hi">Ezra,</span> a scribe fit for the kingdome of heauen, in whose treasure were things new and old. In the <span class="hi">Maccabean</span> times all went to ruine, language and lawes and all lost: and since that time to this day, the pure Hebrew hath lost her fami­liaritie, being onely knowne by schol­lers or at least not without teaching. Our Sauiours times spake the Syrian, <span class="hi">Kepha, Golgotha, Talitha,</span> and other words do witnesse; In aftertimes the vnwearied Masorites arose, helpers to preserue the Bible Hebrew intire, and Grammarians helpers to preserue the Idiome aliue; but for restoring it to the old familiaritie, neither of them could preuaile. For, the Iewes haue at this day no abiding citie, no Com­mon wealth, no proper tongue, but speake as the countries wherein they liue. This whereof they were once <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5517"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=58">[Page 105]</a></span> most nice is gone, and this groat they haue lost. As the man in <span class="hi">Seneca</span> that through sicknes lost his memorie, and forgot his own name; so they for their sin haue lost their language, and for­got their own tongue. Their <span class="hi">Cain</span>-like wandring, after the murther of their brother, according to the flesh, Christ Iesus, hath lost them this precious marke of Gods fauour, and branded them with a worse marke: <span class="hi">Cauterio conspirationis antiquae,</span> as saith Saint <span class="hi">Bernard</span> in another case. Before the confusion of tongues all the world spake their tongue and no other, but since the confusion of the Iewes, they speake the language of all the world, and not their owne. And that it is not with them so, onely of late, but hath been long; <span class="hi">Theodoret</span> beareth witnesse in these words▪ <span class="hi">Other nations</span> (saith he) <span class="hi">haue their children speaking quickly in their owne mother tongue.

How truely I re­ferre to the Readers iudgement.</p><p>The character wee now haue is ei­ther a set or a running letter: the first, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5613"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=60">[Page 108]</a></span> the Bible is ordinarily Printed in, in the latter the most of the Rabbins.</p><p>The whole tongue is contained in the Bible, and no one booke else in the world, containes in it a whole language. And this shewes that the Scripture speakes to all sorts of peo­ple, since it speakes of all sorts of things. This language is (as God said the Iewes should bee, if they would keepe his Law.) A lender to all, and a borrower of none. All tongues are in debt to this, and this to none. The Easterne most especially must ac­knowledge this. <span class="hi">Some men in the East (saith Origen) reserue their old speech, (meaning by likelihood the Hebrew) and haue not altered it, but haue continued in the Easterne tongue, because they haue continued in the Easterne countries.</span> No Easterne tongue that I haue heard of, is Hebrew now, so that what to say to <span class="hi">Origen</span> I cannot tell, vnlesse he meane that those that haue continued in the East, haue kept neerest this holy <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5627"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=60">[Page 109]</a></span> tongue, because neerest the holy land: this to be true is knowne to the meanest learned. In their speech it is apparent, and by their writing con­firmed. All of them haue learned from the Hebrew, to write from the right hand to the left (or as we vsuall call it in England, to write, and reade backward:) The <span class="hi">China</span> and <span class="hi">Ia­pan</span> writing excepted, which is indeed from the right hand to the left, but not with the lines crossing the leafe as other tongues doe, but the lines downe the leafe. A strange way by it selfe.</p><p>Againe, most of the Easterne tongues do vse the Hebrew character for quicke writing, or some other end. The Chaldee letter is the verie fame. The Syrian though it haue two or three kinds of its owne, yet is content sometime to take vpon it the Hebrew character. The Arabian doth the like, especially the Iewes in Turkie vse in hatred of Mahumetans, to write <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5642"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=61">[Page 110]</a></span> downe their matters of Religion; in the Hebrew character, though in the Arabian tongue. So do the Christian Arabians for the same cause in their holy things, vse the Arabian tongue, but Syrian letter. And I take a place in <span class="hi">Epiphanius</span> to be meant to this pur­pose, also about the Persian tongue. His words out of another are these. <span class="hi">The Persians besides their owne letters do also vse the letters of the Syrians: as in our times many nations vse the Greeke, though almost euery nation hath a proper character.</span> I referre to the Rea­der to iudge whether hee meane not that the Persians (as other countries about them did,) did vse the Hebrew character for their quicke writing: which is called Syrian by <span class="hi">Theodoret.</span></p><p>To speake of the grace, and sweet­nesse, and fulnesse of the Hebrew tongue, is to no purpose to relate, for euen those that cannot reade this tongue haue reade thus much of it.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.31"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5663"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=61">[Page 111]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">31. </span><span class="head">CAP.

In like sort, for the preparation for the Gospell of late (which as farre as Antichrist his power could reach, lay depressed, but not ouerwhelmed;) the Greeke tongue at the sacking of Constantinople by the Turkes, was sent into these Westerne climates; that we might heare Christ speake in his owne language, without an <span class="hi">Ae­gyptian</span> to interpret to vs, as <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> had to his brethren: What need we now to rely vpon a Latine foundati­on, when we haue the Greeke purity?

A shorter and yet a fuller com­ment needes not to be giuen of them, then what our Sauiour hath giuen, <span class="hi">Luke</span> 10.27. <span class="hi">Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thy selfe.</span> The foure commande­ments of the first table he expounds in foure words.</p><p>The Lord thy God, there is the Preface, I am the Lord, &amp;c.</p><p>Thou shalt loue the Lord, &amp;c. with all thy </p><ul><li class="item">Heart. for the First Comman­dement.</li><li class="item">Soule. for the Second Comman­dement.</li><li class="item">Strength for the Third Comman­dement.</li><li class="item">Mind. for the Fourth Comman­dement.</li></ul><p>If wee need any further exposition vpon this exposition of our Sauiours, it is easie to find: as, thou shal<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9185"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=107">[Page 200]</a></span> loue the Lord thy God with all thine </p><ul><li class="item">Heart. For it he hath Created,</li><li class="item">Soule. For it he hath Redeemed,</li><li class="item">Strength. For it he hath Preserued,</li><li class="item">Mind.

The first hath one, <span class="hi">Honour thy father,</span> &amp;c. the last but one, hath one, <span class="hi">thou shalt not witnesse falsely against thy <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9221"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=107">[Page 201]</a></span> neighbor:</span> And so the last hath, <span class="hi">Thou shalt not couet ought of thy Neighbours:</span> But <span class="hi">Thou shalt not kill, steale, and commit adulterie,</span> these haue no obiect, <span class="hi">viz.</span> none named whom, from whom, and with whom wee must not kill, steale, nor adulterate: because wee must make our selues al­so the obiect here: and reflect the Commandements vpon our selues, as thus: Thou shalt not kill, first not thy selfe, and secondly, not thy neighbour, and so of the rest. The Iewes haue beene too bold in ad­ding too strict an obiect, as you may see in their explaning these three precepts. And some Hereticks haue beene too nice in giuing some of them too <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note72">For <span class="hi">Mar­cion</span> held it vnlaw­full to kil a beast, because the com­mand <span class="hi">non occides,</span> hath no set obiect: <span class="hi">Aug. de Ciu.

The order of these Pre­cepts they haue set downe in the mar­gin of the Pentateuch with the three-fold. Targum printed at Hannow, and in Sepher Hahhinnuch. I had translated some hundreds of them into English, which I thought to haue finished, and presented to the view of the Reader, but I finde, that without the Iewes Comments vpon these their Diuisions, they can hardly bee vnderstood: which to bring withall, is a paines of no small time and labour. These my obseruations and collections in my Reading, accept gentle Reader <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9280"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=9004&amp;page=108">[Page 203]</a></span> and the slips passe ouer with a gen­tle eye, as slips of youth: which more mature yeares may recure, if God prosper and second. To whom I commit my selfe, and commend thee, and to whom be all honour and glory for euermore. <span class="hi">Amen.</span></p><div class="trailer">FINIS.</div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Lightfoot, John, 1602-1675..
