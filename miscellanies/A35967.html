Prepare a great many Vipers after this fashion. After this, put the bulks of the bodies upon some Plate apart, and the hearts and livers by themselves upon another likewise; and the tongue upon another, without washing them at all; and put them to be dried gently in a fur­nace that is but a little warm. All this must be ob­served in the beginning; afterwards a little more heat is required, that so the humidity may be the sooner dried up, which otherwise might be the cause of their being spoiled. But after this first time, which may be perhaps a night; one needs not but to keep them in a dry place with so little a heat, that they may fully be dried, and hardned, to be fit for to be pounded; which will be done within eight or ten days.

It must be now and then sifted what will pass through a hair cloth; but what will not, must be pounded again, dropping upon it from time to time of your Balsoms. And if so be there be any likelihood of any quantity of the powder, let it run again through the Sieve, what will go through, and pound again the rest with the Balsoms; doing this so long till all be passed through.</p><p>The Author told me, that all will not pass, but that at the end there will remain a white powder, which cannot be pounded any more, which are the bones; and he throweth it away as useless: besides that there is but little of it, and your powder is pre­pared.</p></div><div class="recipe" id="index.xml-body.1_div.194"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3565"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=58478&amp;page=61">[Page 116]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">194. </span><span class="head">The Balsam Compounded is made thus.</span></h2><p>Take of Myrrhe, <span class="hi">Ligni Aloes,</span> yellow Sanders, of each one ounce. <span class="hi">Specier.
