That which may make somewhat of this kind more necessary in my Case, than others is, That a great part of this Collection consists of familiar Letters, which sort of Writings some Learned Persons among us have thought unfit to be publish'd. It must be confess'd, indeed, that a great Beauty of Letters does often consist in little Passages of private Conversation, and references to particu­lar Matters, that can be understood by none but those to whom they are written: But to draw a general Conclusion from thence, That fami­liar Letters can please none, but those very Per­sons, is to conclude against the common Experi­ence of all the World; since besides the great ap­plauses have been given the Letters of <span class="hi">Cicero</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e198"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> and <span class="hi">Pliny</span> among the <span class="hi">Romans;</span> we see no Book has been better received among the <span class="hi">Spa­niards,</span> than the Letters of <span class="hi">Guevara;</span> or a­mong the <span class="hi">French,</span> than those of <span class="hi">Voiture</span> and <span class="hi">Balsac:</span> Not to mention the <span class="hi">Italians,</span> among whom there has been hardly any considerable Man, who has not publish'd Letters with good Success. What may have contributed very much to the kind Reception these things have met, is, that there is no sort of Writing so neces­sary for People to understand as this. A Man may have a great deal of Wit, without being able to write Verses or make Harangues; and may live in very good repute, without having occasion of doing either. But a Man can hard­ly live in the World, without being able to write Letters. There is no state of Life in which a Faculty of that kind is not requisite; and there are few Days pass, in which a Man has not oc­casion to make use of it.</p><p>The Stile of Letters ought to be free, easy and natural; as near approaching to familiar Con­versation as possible. The two best Qualities in Conversation, are good Humour and good Breeding; those Letters are therefore certainly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e240"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> the best that shew the most of those two Quali­ties. There are some Men so surly, so ill na­tur'd, and so ill-bred, that tho' we can hardly deny 'em to have Wit; yet we can say, at least, that we are sorry they have it. And indeed, as their Wit is troublesome to other People, so I can hardly imagine of what great use it can be to themselves. For if the end of Wit, be not to render one self agreeable, I shall scarce envy 'em any other use they can make of it.</p><p>The second Part of this Collection consists of Amorous Verses. Those who are conversant with the Writings of the Antients, will observe a great difference between what they, and the Mo­derns have publish'd upon this Subject. The occasions upon which the Poems of the former are written, are such as happen to every Man almost that is in Love; and the Thoughts such, as are natural for every Man in love to think. The Moderns on the other hand have sought out for Occasions, that none meet with, but them­selves; and fill their Verses with thoughts that are surprizing and glittering, but not tender, passionate, or natural to a Man in Love.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e254"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> To judge which of these two are in the right; we ought to consider the end that People pro­pose in writing Love-Verses: And that I take not to be the getting Fame or Admiration from the World, but the obtaining the Love of their Mi­stress; and the best way I conceive to make her love you, is to convince her that you love her. Now this certainly is not to be done by forc'd Conceits, far fetch'd Similes, and shining Points; but by a true and lively Representation of the Pains and Thoughts attending such a Passion.</p><div class="lg"><div class="l">Si vis me flere, dolendum est: (laedent.</div><div class="l">Primum ipsitibi, tunc tua me infortunia.</div></div><p>I would assoon believe a Widow in great grief for her Husband, because I saw her dance a <span class="hi">Corant</span> about his Coffin, as believe a Man in Love with his Mistress for his writing such Verses, as some great Modern Wits have done upon theirs.</p><p>I am satisfied that <span class="hi">Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius,</span> and <span class="hi">Ovid,</span> were in love with their Mistresses, while they upbraid them, quar­rel with them, threaten them, and forswear <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e280"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> them; but I confess I cannot believe <span class="hi">Petrarch</span> in Love with his, when he writes Conceits upon her Name, her Gloves, and the place of her Birth. I know it is natural for a Lover, in Transports of Iealousie, to treat his Mistress with all the Violence imaginable; but I cannot think it na­tural for a Man, who is much in Love, to a­muse himself with such Trifles as the other. I am pleas'd with <span class="hi">Tibullus,</span> when he says, he could live in a Desart with his Mistress, where never any Humane Foost-steps appear'd, be­cause, I doubt not but he really thinks what he says; but I confess I can hardly for bear laugh­ing when <span class="hi">Petrarch</span> tells us, he could live without any other sustenance than his Mistresses Looks. I can very easily believe a Man may love a Wo­man so well, as to desire no Company but hers; but I can never believe a Man can love a Wo­man so well, as to have no need of Meat and Drink, if he may look upon her. The first is a Thought so natural for a Lover, that there is no Man really in Love, but thinks the same thing; the other is not the thought of a Man in Love, but of a Man who would impose upon us with a pretended Love (and that indeed <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e305"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> very grosly too) while he had really none at all.</p><p>It would be endless to pursue this Point; and any Man who will but give himself the trouble to compare what the Ancients and Moderns have said upon the same Occasions, will soon perceive the advantage the former have over the others. I have chosen to mention <span class="hi">Petrarch</span> only, as be­ing by much the most famous of all the Moderns who have written Love-Verses: And it is, indeed, the great Reputation which he has gotten, that has given Encouragement to this false sort of Wit in the World: for People seeing the great Credit he had, and has, indeed, to this day, not only in <span class="hi">Italy,</span> but over all <span class="hi">Europe;</span> have satisfied themselves with the Imitation of him, never enquiring whether the way he took was the right or not.</p><p>There are no Modern Writers, perhaps, who have succeeded better in Love-Verses than the <span class="hi">English;</span> and it is indeed just that the fairest Ladies should inspire the best Poets. Never was there a more copious Fancy or greater reach of Wit, than what appears in Dr. <span class="hi">Donne;</span> nothing can be more gallant or gentile than the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e329"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> Poems of Mr. <span class="hi">Waller;</span> nothing more gay or sprightly than those of Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Suckling;</span> and nothing fuller of Variety and Learning than Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley's.</span> However, it may be ob­serv'd, that among all these, that Softness, Tenderness, and Violence of Passion, which the Ancients thought most proper for Love-Ver­ses, is wanting: and at the same time that we must allow Dr. <span class="hi">Donne</span> to have been a very great Wit; Mr. <span class="hi">Waller</span> a very gallant Wri­ter; Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Suckling</span> a very gay one, and Mr. <span class="hi">Cowley</span> a great Genius; yet metbinks I can hardly fancy any one of them to have been a very great Lover. And it grieves me that the Ancients, who could never have handsomer Women than we have, should nevertheless be so much more in Love than we are. But it is probable the great Reason of this may be the Cruelty of our Ladies; for a Man must be imprudent in­deed to let his Passion take very deep root, when he has no reason to expect any sort of re­turn to it. And if it be so, there ought to be a Petition made to the Fair, that they would be pleas'd sometimes to abate a little of their Rigor, for the propagation of good Verse. I do not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e364"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> mean, that they should confer their Favours up­on none but Men of Wit: that would be too great a Confinement indeed: but that they would admit them upon the same foot with other Peo­ple; and if they please now and then to make the Experiment, I fancy they will find Entertainment enough from the very Variety of it.</p><p>There are three sorts of Poems that are pro­per for Love: <span class="hi">Pastorals, Elegies,</span> and <span class="hi">Ly­rick</span> Verses; under which last I comprehend all <span class="hi">Songs, Odes, Sonnets, Madrigals</span> and <span class="hi">Stanza's.</span> Of all these, <span class="hi">Pastoral</span> is the lowest, and, upon that account, perhaps most proper for Love; since it is the Nature of that Passion to render the Soul soft and humble. These three sorts of Poems ought to differ, not only in their Numbers, but in the Designs, and in every Thought of them. Though we have no Diffe­rence between the Verses of <span class="hi">Pastoral</span> and <span class="hi">Ele­gy</span> in the Modern Languages; yet the Num­bers of the first ought to be looser and not so sonorous as the other; the Thoughts more simple, more easy and more humble. The Design ought to be the representing the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e405"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> Life of a Shepherd, not only by talking of Sheep and Fields, but by showing us the Truth, Sincerity and Innocence that accompa­nies that sort of Life. For though I know our Masters, <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> and <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> have not al­ways conform'd in this Point of Innocence; <span class="hi">Theocritus,</span> in his <span class="hi">Daphnis,</span> having made his Love too wanton, and <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> in his <span class="hi">Ale­xis,</span> plac'd his Passion upon a Boy; yet (if we may be allow'd to censure those whom we must always reverence) I take both those things to be Faults in their Poems, and should have been better pleas'd with the <span class="hi">Alexis,</span> if it had been made to a Woman; and with the <span class="hi">Daphnis,</span> if he had made his Shepherds more modest. When I give Humility and Modesty as the Character of <span class="hi">Pastoral,</span> it is not, however, but that a Shepherd may be allow'd to boast of his Pipe, his Songs, his Flocks, and to shew a Contempt of his Rival, as we see both <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> and <span class="hi">Virgil</span> do. But this must be still in such a manner, as if the Occasion offer'd it self, and was not sought, and proceeded rather from the Violence of the Shepherd's Passion, than any na­tural Pride or Malice in him.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e453"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> There ought to be the same difference observ'd between <span class="hi">Pastorals</span> and <span class="hi">Elegies,</span> as between the Life of the Country and the Court. In the first, Love ought to be represented as among Shep­herds, in the other as among Gentlemen. They ought to be smooth, clear, tender and passionate. The Thoughts may be bold, more gay, and more elevated than in <span class="hi">Pastoral.</span> The Passions they represent, either more Gallant or more Violent, and less innocent than the others. The subjects of them, Prayers, Praises, Expostulations, Quar­rels, Reconcilements, Threatnings, Iealousies, and, in fine, all the natural Effects of Love.</p><p><span class="hi">Lyricks</span> may be allow'd to handle all the same subjects with Elegy; but to do it how­ever in a different manner. An Elegy ought to be so entirely one thing, and every Verse ought so to depend upon the other, that they should not be able to subsist alone: Or, to make use of the words of a <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note6">My Lord <span class="hi">Mulgrave.</span></span> great Modern Critick, there must be</p><div class="lg"><div class="l">—a just Coherence made</div><div class="l">Between each Thought, and the whole Model laid;</div><div class="l">So right, that every step may higher rise,</div><div class="l">Like goodly Mountains, till they reach the Skies.</div></div><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e493"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> <span class="hi">Lyricks</span> on the other hand, tho' they ought to make one Body as well as the other, yet may consist of Parts that are entire of themselves. It being a Rule in Modern Languages, that every <span class="hi">Stanza</span> ought to make up a compleat sence, without running into the other. Frequent Sen­tences which are accounted Faults in <span class="hi">Elegies,</span> are Beauties here. Besides this, <span class="hi">Malherb,</span> and the <span class="hi">French</span> Poets after him, have made it a Rule in the <span class="hi">Stanzas</span> of six Lines, to make a pause at the third; and in those of ten Lines, at the third and the seventh. And it must be con­fest that this exactness renders them much more Musical and Harmonious; tho' they have not always been so Religious in observing the latter Rule as the former.</p><p>But I am engaged in a very vain, or a very foolish Design: Those who are Criticks, it wou'd be a presumption in me to pretend I cou'd in­struct; and to instruct those who are not, at the same time I write my self, is (if I may be al­low'd to apply another Man's Simile) like selling Arms to an Enemy in time of War. Tho' there ought, perhaps, to be more indulgence shewn to things of Love and Gallantry, than any <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e524"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> others; because they are generally written when People are young, and intended for Ladies who are not supposed to be very old; and all young People, especially of the fair Sex, are more taken with the liveliness of Fancy, than the correctness of Iudgment. It may be also observ'd, that to write of Love well, a Man must be really in Love; and to correct his Writings well, he must be out of Love again. I am well enough satisfi'd, I may be in Circumstances of writing of Love; but I am almost in despair of ever being in Cir­cumstances of correcting it. This I hope may be a Reason for the Fair and the Young, to pass over some of the Faults; and as for the Grave and Wise, all the Favour I shall beg of them is, that they wou'd not read'em. Things of this Nature, are calculated only for the former. If Love-Verses work upon the Ladies, a Man will not trouble himself with what the Cri­ticks say of them; and if they do not, all the Commendations the Criticks can give him, will make but very little amends. All I shall say for these trifles is, That I pretend not to vye with any Man whatsoever. I doubt not but there are several now living, who are able to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e531"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> write better upon all Subjects, than I am upon any one: But I will take the boldness to say, That there is no one Man among them all, who shall be readier to acknowledge his own Faults, or to do Iustice to the Merits of o­ther People.</p></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_front"><li class="toc"><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-front.1_div.2">PREFACE.</a></li></ul><ul class="toc toc_body"><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.1">LETTERS Gallant &amp; Amorous.</a><ul class="toc"><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><a class="toc toc_1" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1">LETTER I.

Consider a little under what difficulties you make me labour: If I shou'd commend the Colour of your Hair, and it was all the while deep red; the smoothness and delicacy of your Skins, when they were rough and tawney; the fineness of your Shapes, while you were stuck up within Iron Bodice; the brightness of your Eyes, and they shou'd prove blear'd and squinting.

As for this way, I can assure you, I find it not in the least fair; and had rather be in love with the most hard-hearted Beauty living, than continue in this uncertain state, and nei­ther know what I love, why I love, nor whether I love, or no.

I concluded I had done the boldest Action in the World, to declare a Passion to two Masques; but you, Madam, set up a Title of your own, and are not satisfied without Particu­larity, and Constancy. Your Charms I confess, Madam, as far as I saw of them, are very great: The Masque was very good <span class="hi">Genoa</span> Velvet; the Gloves very good <span class="hi">Blois</span> Gloves, and the Hackney Coach, for ought I know, lin'd with very good green Plush. Now, Madam, though so far I do stedfastly believe, yet to fall constant­ly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e591"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=11">[Page 5]</a></span> and particularly in love with Masques, Gloves, or Hackney-Coaches, is what I do not find a Precedent for, in any of the <span class="hi">French</span> Romances; and being naturally diffident of my self, I shou'd be loth to begin a new sort of Gallantry, without knowing how it wou'd take. Consider, Madam, a little better upon the reasonableness of your Request; for Particularity and Constancy are very hardly to be an­swer'd for, at our Years. It is, I doubt not, Madam, in your power to blow my Love up to that heighth whenever you please; and to confess a truth to you, I have a very great Stock of Particularity and Constancy lying upon my Hands at this time, and know not how to apply it. I have all the reason in the World to imagine it is kept for you; but however, Ma­dam, it wou'd be necessary to have one view of you, before I can be po­sitive in that point.

These are the only Terms upon which I can treat any farther with you; for tho' you write the most agreeably in the World, yet you must certainly own, that after having been monstrously in love for a whole Week together, it is very reasonable that a Man shou'd know at last with whom it is.</p></div><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e630"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=13">[Page 8]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4. </span><span class="head">LETTER IV.</span><br /><span class="head">To the same.</span></h3><p>YEs really, Madam, I think you are in the right of it; Hanging and Drowning are such vulgar ways of Dying, that for my part I wou'd rather live a thousand Years, than make use of either. Then, Madam, they are the most inconvenient Me­thods in the World; Drowning will spoil your Clothes, and Hanging your Complexion; besides several other things that might be said to dissuade you from it, but that I know a word to the Wise is enough. I am of Opi­nion you had better deferr all sort of dying 'till another Opportunity; though if you are positive in it, I wou'd rather recommend Mr. <span class="hi">Boyle's</span> Air-Pump as a newer Invention; or being poisoned <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e644"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=13">[Page 9]</a></span> in Perfumes, as somewhat that looks pleasant enough. But to be less se­rious, Madam, make no doubt of your own Perfections, and reckon that in having me, you have the most reasonable Lover, of an unreasonable Lover, in the World. I confess were I to form a Beauty to my self, she shou'd be—let me consider a little upon it; she shou'd be—I protest, Madam, I know not what she shou'd be: monstrously in love with me, that is certain; for the rest, I shou'd trust the Stars, I think I may say, without Flattery, I love my self so well, that I can love any body else that does so too; and shou'd preferr that single Beauty, of an immoderate Pas­sion for me in a Mistress, to all the other Charms in the World, as <span class="hi">Bayes</span> does the single beating of Armies in his Hero, to all the Moral Vertues put together.

As my Provocations are much greater than either of these, so if my Indignation were answerable to 'em, you cou'd not expect to be forgiven by me, even in the Article of Death: For after all People can say of Here­ticks <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e679"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=14">[Page 11]</a></span> and Cowards, they will allow 'em to be Men; but by your Refle­ctions upon me, you wou'd degrade me from that Rank, without allow­ing me any place among the infe­riour Creatures. Had you call'd me Brute, or Beast, I had not been so zealous in my own Iustification: Dai­ly Experience convinces us, That Men who have no more Understanding than Horses, or Mules, provided they have all the other Qualifications of those Noble Animals, may be acce­ptable enough to some or other of the fair Sex; but want of Virility is an Imputation that will cut a Man off from all sort of Communication with 'em. Had the Husbands or Old Women had this Opinion of me, I shou'd not have been so violent in my own Defence. Scandals, as well as Oaths, ought to be taken in the sense of those that impose 'em; I shou'd not be angry at a Turk, or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e692"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=15">[Page 12]</a></span> a Iew, for thinking me of their Reli­gion; because whatever I thought it was what made them like me the bet­ter; but this wou'd be no Reason to make me forgive a Christian for cal­ling me so. In like manner, Madam, though I cou'd have pardon'd the Hus­bands and Old Women for saying such a thing of me, yet I can very hardly pardon you for it. It were in vain to call Witnesses in this case, or turn you over to another hand for Satisfaction in that point, which can only properly be resolv'd by my self; and it were as vain to think to clear my self by Words from an Imputation that ought to be done by Actions; I shall therefore only challenge you to meet me at your own place and time; where I doubt not to give you full Sa­tisfaction in this point, and convince you that I am not the Man (or rather indeed the No Man) that you take me <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e705"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=15">[Page 13]</a></span> to be.

But, Madam, that we may not mistake one another in this point, and that I may not take for an Encouragement of my Passion, what you intend for a Dis­couragement of it; I must tell you, That if you do not look upon me after this, I shall believe you are in love, and that makes you bashful: If you look angrily, I shall think it is to give me occasion to come and justifie my self; and if you look negligently, I shall conclude 'tis ma­nagement to disguise the Amour from the World: In fine, Madam, I shall take nothing for a Refusal of my Heart, but looking very kindly upon me. But that you may not be mistaken in the Person who sends this, and imagine it to come from some Lord with a blue Garter, or white Staff, that comes from a Commoner with­out either.

Yes, Madam, I under stand very well what I say, Will they love you as little? for that is the only difficulty you have to apprehend. There is no question but a Man who is possess'd of the most charming-Creature in the Universe, will be con­stant to her as long as she pleases; but it is a great Question if he will part with her as soon as she pleases. This is the Rock upon which those Ladies split, who will admit of none but constant Lovers; not considering that the Women are as changeable as the Men can be for the Lives of them <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e754"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=17">[Page 17]</a></span> and consider, pray, into what pretty Circumstances a Lady brings herself, who is plagu'd with an obstinate old Lover, when she is passionately in love with a new one.

They tell me, Madam, you are so far from liking me your self, that you will not believe any Body else can: That you find nothing agreeable in my Person, from the Crown of my Head, to the Soal of my Foot: That for my Wit, (for every body, Madam, carries somewhat about them which they call Wit) it is all Affecta­tion: That I am an Abstract of Vanity: That I am so much in love <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e775"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=18">[Page 19]</a></span> with my self, that it is impossible for me to be so with any Body else. These things, Madam, that might have put some People into Anger, have put me into Love: For as those who are naturally peevish, will be angry at People, let them endeavour never so much to please 'em; so we who are naturally amorous, cannot avoid being in love with a Lady, let her take never so much pains to anger us. And indeed, Madam, did People ground their Passions upon Reason, you have given me one of the most reasonable Causes to love you in the World: For as there is no Man of Wit but knows himself to be a Fool, so he ought to have an Opinion of their Iudgments, who find it out as well as himself. It is reported as an Instance of the Bravery of the <span class="hi">Amazons,</span> That they wou'd never marry a Man, 'till they had fought with him first; and if he beat 'em very much, he <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e780"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=19">[Page 20]</a></span> might expect to be loved very much by them. Now I, Madam, who profess as great a Veneration for Wit, as the <span class="hi">Amazons</span> had for Courage, cannot have so good a Reason for Love, as your having exercis'd your Wit upon me: Tho' it is possible you may attribute my Passion to another Cause, and as you think I love nothing beside my self, may have some kindness for you, because you are never like to be my Rival; however, assure your self, Madam, it is no such thing, but knowing the worst you can say of me to be true, and having a natural Affection for Truth, Wit, and Women, (you will think a Man a very general Lover, that can love Truth, Wit, and Women, at the same time) I must needs be infinitely in love with you, in whom I find 'em altogether. Be not however deluded into a better Opinion of me, by what any body can say; for as it is only your hating me that makes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e786"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=19">[Page 21]</a></span> me love you, as soon as that ceases, I am afraid my Love will do so too.

But that I may not condemn you without a Cause, nor conclude you guilty 'till I hear what you can say in your own Iustification, I will give you a plain account of the Business.

I, who do not naturally love to dispute with a fair Lady, (especially in a Cause where I thought my self no more concern'd than if she had talk'd of Iews or Mahometans) agreed with her in all she said; when she turn'd briskly upon me, and told me, For that Reason a Woman must have a care of having any thing to do with me. I told her that was acting after the manner of some late Iudges; call a thing Treason with­out Law, and then hang a Man for it without Proof: That I appeal'd to all the World for my Innocence in the matter, and defied my greatest Enemies to bring any Evidence of my guilt. She told me she had it from such a one, who had it from another; and that, in fine, the original Author of this Calumny was your self.

You who very well know, That to com­mend a Man for a Wit to the Women, is like commending him for a good Protestant to the Fathers of the Inqui­sition; and he that reported me an Eunuch among 'em, cou'd not do it upon a more malicious account.

Well, Sir, I am a Gentle­man; nor shall I pass by such a thing as this, without satisfaction.

After all, methinks if you wou'd be hearty in the thing, you may bring me out of these Difficulties: I know you have Wit enough to convince 'em that I have none; and if the worst come to the worst, it is but carrying you to 'em, to shew the difference.

We had very positive news one while of your being married; and as positive after, that it was not yet done; which some here took, I can assure you, for a great Act of Mercy. Half a dozen Sparks of your Acquaintance <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e904"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=23">[Page 29]</a></span> have provided themselves either with Love-Songs, or Epithalamiums, to send you, as occasion shall require, without being yet able to know which wou'd be most proper: And here are half a dozen more, who have had Halters about their Necks, ever since the Report of your going to be mar­ried; for they are resolv'd to be ready upon the first notice, That the same Post which brings the news of your Wedding, may carry back that of their Deaths. 'Tis true, Madam, I took the boldness to advise 'em not to be over-hasty in the Affair, since they might do it afterwards at their own Convenience; and Experiments of this nature were difficult enough to correct, when they were once ill done. But all I could say was in vain; they are positive in the matter, and half a dozen of the handsomest Trees in the Park, are mark'd out for the Execution. I must confess, I endea­vour'd <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e911"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=24">[Page 30]</a></span> to divert 'em as much as I cou'd from chusing that place, for the Benefit of the Company that walks there; I told 'em it was contrary to all precedent, to make use of Elms, or Lime-Trees, since the Willow had time out of mind been reserv'd for that use; and that a Lover who did not hang himself according to form, had as good never hang himself at all. They answer'd me very surli­ly, (though very truly too I must own) That it was not my Business: That it was a very hard case People might not hang themselves without asking my leave; and as they wou'd not hin­der me whenever I was going about such a thing, so they took it very ill that I shou'd pretend to hinder them. I must confess, Madam, I cou'd say very little in the case; and you may believe I had no great mind to en­ter upon a Quarrel with People in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e919"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=24">[Page 31]</a></span> their Circumstances; but I thought the acquainting you with it, was a Duty that became</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your, &amp;c.</div></div></div><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.12"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.12. </span><span class="head">LETTER XII.</span><br /><span class="head">To a Lady that ask'd him for his Heart.</span></h3><p>THo' to tell a Man that you will dispose of his Heart to one who shall use it ill, is but a very small Encouragement for him to part with it; yet since you say you have a particular fancy for mine, I cannot refuse you such a trifle as that, upon whatever terms you demand it. I have enclosed it therefore in this Letter, and trusted it to the Penny-Post, lest your Generosity shou'd have made you give a Messenger more for the bring­ing it, than the thing it self is really <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e935"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=25">[Page 32]</a></span> worth. I wish, Madam, it were bet­ter for your sake; and can assure you, That were it the most mo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ish one in the World, it shou'd be at your Ser­vice. As it is, Madam, I am afraid you will think it very old fashion'd, and too much given to those anti­quated Qualities, Constancy and Fi­delity. It is probable the Lady for whom you intend it, may despise those Things, and think a Heart of that sort as ridiculous as a Lover in a short Cloak, slash Sleeves, pinck'd Doublet, and trunk Hose. But let her not be prejudic'd against things for their first appearances; I have seen a very awkward Beginner, come to Dance very well at last; and it is not impossible but by good ma­nagement the Heart may be brought quite off those disagreeable Qualities. You may please to tell her, That it having been bred up very tenderly 'till now, it wou'd be convenient to treat <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e952"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=25">[Page 33]</a></span> it a little kindlier than ordinary at first, lest it shou'd be apt to run away: She shou'd encourage his Sighs now and then with a kind Whisper; and when she sees the Fire grow a little faint, let her give but one or two kind Looks, and it will blaze out afresh. Having been troubled with an extra­ordinary Fever, since it was in the presence of a certain Lady, it ought not to be exposed to the open Air, for fear of catching cold; she may conveniently enough confine it to her Bed-chamber, where it may be of great use rightly manag'd, and wake her in a morning with half a dozen deep-fetch'd Sighs, better than any Larum-Clock. You see, Madam, what Confidence I have in your Con­duct, since I trust you to dispose of a Heart for me, that I have never been able to dispose of my self. You will think, perhaps, it is but making a Vertue of Necessity, and surrendring <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e959"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=26">[Page 34]</a></span> up a Fort which I am not able to hold out against you. However, Madam, the fiercest Conquerors are kind to Garrisons that yield upon the first Sum­mons; and as I know your Power to be greater than any of theirs; so I doubt not but your Vertues are answerable to 'em. All the favour I shall beg for my Heart, is, That it may be treated as a Prisoner of War, and that I may have the liberty of keeping a Correspondence with it, du­ring its Confinement. To show you I intend nothing but what is fair, I am satisfied you shou'd read all the Letters I write; and that none shou'd come to me, but by your Approba­tion. And indeed you need not fear this making any escape; for if I can guess at all at his Humour, he will preferr such a Captivity to all the Li­berty in the World; and will not be so proud of the Titles of Prince, or Con­queror, as that of your <span class="hi">Prisoner &amp; Slave.</span></p></div><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.13"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e976"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=26">[Page 35]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.13. </span><span class="head">LETTER XIII.</span><br /><span class="head">To the same.</span></h3><div class="lg"><div class="l">If streaming Blood my fatal Letter stain,</div><div class="l">Imagine ere you read, the Writer slain:</div><div class="l">One Hand the Sword, and one the Pen employs,</div><div class="l">And in my Lap the ready Paper lies.</div></div><p>I Have been these six Hours in de­bate, Whether I shou'd stab my self, or write to you first?

The Business then in short, Madam, is this: Coming home about Twelve a Clock last Night, I found a Letter, to tell me, That I shou'd meet you in—at Five a Clock in the Afternoon. Now, Madam, I am really so sensible of my guilt of disappointing you in this manner, that after having arraign'd, judg'd, and condemn'd my self for it, I am just now upon the point of Executi­on. I must confess, some People have advis'd me to the contrary, and tell me you cannot take it ill that I did not meet you, when you know how late it was before I receiv'd the Letter. But I told them, That after having written to you, I ought never to have stirr'd from home, but staid in expectati­on of an answer.

I am a­sham'd to tell you how long I have been so; but I am ten times more asham'd to tell you, I do not yet find the least decay in my Passion, tho' I have reason enough to believe the Lady did not care tho' she saw me hanging up at her Gate. Well; we may put as good a face upon the mat­ter <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1674"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=41">[Page 65]</a></span> as we will; but first or last I see Con­stancy comes upon us all. In the humor I am at present, I had a good mind to forswear ever being in love again. And yet upon better thoughts, I think I had as good try it once more: For of three Amours I have had in my Life-time, (as for Amourettes, those are not worth mentioning) I va­lu'd the one Mistress after I left lo­ving her; I loved another, after I left valuing her; I love and value the third, after having lost all hopes of her: So that methinks according to the course of my Passions, I ought to love and value the next, after having ob­tained her. However, from this time forward, upon what Follies soever you fall, be pleased for my sake to spare those of love; being very well sa­tisfied, there is not one Folly of that kind (except Marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without raillery, in love with the Beauty <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1687"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=42">[Page 66]</a></span> of a Woman whom I have never seen; with the Wit of one whom I have never heard speak, nor seen any thing that she has written; and with the Heroick Vertues of a Woman, without knowing any one Action of her Life, that cou'd make me think she had any. Considering how very common these Qualities are, I suppose you will not ask me if I have ever been mistaken. I know not what you think in the Country; but, for my part, I am of Opinion a Man must resolve to abandon Women or Philo­sophy entirely, for they will never a­gree well together. After an absence of five or six Months from Town, I find the Ladies still the same; that is to say, still various. Those who were in love when I went from hence, are in love still; but they are in love with other Men. They are constant to Love, but inconstant to the Lovers: And in this point, to speak the truth <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1694"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=42">[Page 67]</a></span> among Friends, I think there is no great difference between the two Sexes. The Men complain of the Women's in­constancy, and the Women of the Men's; for my part being unwilling to disoblige either, I am very apt to agree with both. But <span class="hi">Cupid</span> will have it so; and what can weak Mortals do against so potent a God? Adieu; live pleasantly, that is, philosophi­cally; and guard your Heart from the Pains of Love.</p></div></div><div class="half_title" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span></h2><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1704"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=43">[Page]</a></div><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1705"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=43">[Page]</a></div><p>POEMS.</p></div><div class="poems" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1709"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=44">[Page]</a></div><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1710"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=44">[Page 71]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><span class="head">POEMS.</span></h2><div class="poem" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.1. </span><span class="head">To his Book.</span></h3><div class="l">GO, little Book, and to the World impart</div><div class="l">The faithful Image of an am'rous Heart:</div><div class="l">Those who Love's dear, deluding Pains have known,</div><div class="l">May in my fatal Stories read their own.</div><div class="l">Those who have liv'd from all its Torments free,</div><div class="l">May find the thing they never felt, by me.</div><div class="l">Perhaps advis'd, avoid the gilded Bait,</div><div class="l">And, warn'd by my Example, shun my Fate.</div><div class="l">While with calm Ioy, safe landed on the Coast,</div><div class="l">I view the Waves on which I once was tost.</div><div class="l"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1739"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=51854&amp;page=45">[Page 72]</a></span> Love is a medley of Endearments, Iars,</div><div class="l">Suspicions, Quarrels, Reconcilements, Wars;</div><div class="l">Then Peace again.
