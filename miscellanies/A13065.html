For in the darke places, and in the darkeſome night, our mindes doo wander aſtray, neither haue they any proui­dence which reſpecteth life euerlaſting: we all like ſhéepe haue wandered out of the way which leadeth vnto eternall bleſſed­neſſe, yea, except we be layd vpon Chriſtes ſhoulders, and be carried hanging about his necke, we ſhall (plunged headlong in darkneſſe and errours) perriſh euerlaſtingly. And what in vs is there, wherewith wee are able to reſiſt the deuill when he aſſaulteth vs?

The ſecond is, no creature can alwaies and euery where bee preſent with the Church and euery member thereof. The thyrd is, no creature can ſée the ſights of the hart, and diſcerne true inuocation from hypocriſie. And the fourth cauſe is, no creature entreth into counſell with the diuine nature. For theſe cauſes, which els where are largely explained, it is needfull that the Sheepeheard and Biſhoppe of our ſoules be <span class="hi">Iehoua,</span> that is, GOD, whoſe nature and power is eternal, vnſpeakable, and infinite.</p><p>Thus farre haue I ſpoken of the firſt part of the <span class="hi">Syllo­giſme,</span> indéede more breefe then for the greatneſſe of the mat­ter: but, as the manner of theſe Comments, ought in truth to be: now wyll I ſpeake of the other part or member, which of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2383"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1118&amp;page=22">[Page 34]</a></span> Logicians is called the <span class="hi">Conſequent. <span class="hi">[I ſhall not lacke: or no­thing ſhall be lacking vnto me.]</span></span> It is a moſt ſure rule, hee that hath the word of God, he hath God himſelfe: hee y<sup>t</sup> hath God, to him can nothing of the principall bleſſednes be lack­ing, becauſe God was before the worlde was made, and by his word he made all things, therefore the word of God ma­keth and bringeth all things vnto vs: but contrariwiſe, hee that hath not the word, hee hath nothing, but fainteth amidſt the floodes, like vnto <span class="hi">Tantalus,</span> and as he ſéemeth moſt to haue any thing, ſo yet within a while after, euen that is taken a­way from him, according to that ſaying of Chriſt: <span class="hi">To hym that hath, ſhall be giuen: and from him that hath not,</span> (name­lie the word) <span class="hi">euen this that he ſeemeth to haue, ſhall be taken away from him. <span class="hi">Luke, 19, verſe. 26.</span></span></p><p>But although theſe ſpéeches are proudly ſcorned &amp; hate­fully handled of prophane perſons: yet notwithſtanding, let vs beléeue Chriſt affirming them, who is <span class="hi">Trueth it ſelfe,</span> ſo to vs ſaying: <span class="hi">Firſt ſeeke ye the Kingdome of God, and all o­ther things ſhall be giuen vnto you. <span class="hi">Math, 6, 33.</span></span> As if he ſaid, if any man haue, by Gods graunt and gyft, the chéefe good things, acknowledgment and calling vpon God, conſolation and gouernment of the holie Spirit, obedience agreeable to the wyll of God, and ſpecially remiſſion of ſinnes, and deliue­raunce from the power of the deuill, and from euerlaſting death, finally, if he haue righteouſnes and life euerlaſting, to him are none appurtenaunces lacking, or helping ſuſtentati­ons of thys our mortall life and calling.
