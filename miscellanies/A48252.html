Lastly, lest we should be further troublesome to your Grace, we wish we could speak out and pub­lish to the World, what Thanks we conceive in our Minds for this so genuine and proper a Gift, so fraught with sweetest Elegancies; Then, though there be so vast a disproportion between your Gra­ces Favours and our Merits, our distance would be so much the less: Farewel most Noble Princess, long may your Grace live, who are an ornament to Learning, and a Patroness to the Learned and us, who are,</p><blockquote class="closer"><p><span class="hi">Your Graces most devoted Servants in all Duty and Reverence,</span> The Master and Fellows of the Colledge of St. <span class="hi">John</span> the Evangelist in the University of <span class="hi">Cambridge.</span></p></blockquote></div><div lang="lat" class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h3 lang="lat"><span class="headingNumber">1.5. </span></h3><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e423"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=5">[Page 6]</a></div><div class="opener"><div class="salute">ILLUSTRISSIMA PRINCEPS,</div></div><p>LIbros tuos eximios illos opido &amp; felicissimè In­genii partum excepit nostrum hoc Collegium eâdem gaudii magnitudine, quâ olim Illustris­simi Principis Conjugis Tui adventum nos hîc con­victu suo non dedignantis.

In the mean time we may justly pride our selves in this, that your Excellency, as well as our Learning, is so much the cause of our Happiness, that none can commend your Gifts, or express their worth, but will himself thereby grow more commendable: therefore have we Praise and Duty joyned, that we may not avouch how much we owe being un­thankful, nor understand what we have received unless Learned: Your Excellency doth not only bestow Gifts worthy your Nobleness, but also there­by make way that we our selves may, in time, be worthy of your so great Favors: which is a reason of well-deserving, proper only to your self: neither <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e644"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=7">[Page 11]</a></span> indeed doth your Excellency only afford Patronage to Learning (which you only can do) but also make Arts more famous; and whatsoever there is any where of Sciences you do happily promote and adorne. Pardon us most Illustrious Marchioness if we often wonder to whom, at length, your Excel­lency, and we our selves, do so much owe those excellent Arts, and your Excellencies Endowments; how it came to pass that Eloquence, Poetry, Phi­losophy, things otherwise most different, should without the help of a Tutor, without the Mid­wifery of an University, at length, agree in a Woman: Indeed we who wonder that the Antients should adore the same tutelar Godess both of Arts and Arms, what shall we think of your Excellency, who are both a <span class="hi">Minerva</span> and an <span class="hi">Athens</span> to your self, the <span class="hi">Muses</span> as well as an <span class="hi">Helicon, Aristotle</span> as well as his <span class="hi">Lycaeum?</span> Indeed such is our condition that we can sooner understand our own happiness then express yours, which is so far beyond the high­est of our expressions, as this present Description, such as it is, is beyond the necessity of a Fiction. We think it concerns us very much (who have the happiness to understand so much of your Excellency) some way to testify, according to our genius and that of this place, then which none can admire you more, with what mind, withwhat desires, with what real affections we do receive and em­brace your most Excellent Works; which part of our duty we do as sincerely perform as it doth truly tend to the great honour of this florishing So­citey, that we enjoy your Excellencies undeserved favour, whom all Learning doth commend, and all degrees of the Learned adore and honor.

I am, I confess, no great reader, of late, of new Books, having tried formerly, that to find in them the least Jewel it must be sifted out of a great deal of Rubbish, and the worst is, that their Authors take up Errors upon trust one from another, which the better they adorn with new dresses, the greater injury they do to man­kind. To make up such Volumes out of Collecti­ons, as Bees gather Hony from this and that Flower, is rather laborious Industry than fine Wit; But to spin out of one's own Bowels, not Cobwebs as Spiders do, but rich Tissues of Gold and Silver, ex­presses a great Fancy well improved, with much thinking. As every man is not capable of so extra­ordinary Productions, so is not every Woman; but that Women are naturally as capable of it as Men, if not more, may easily be proved by making an exact comparison of both their Temperaments and Organs, which would be a discourse too long to be inserted in a Letter, and your Excellence hath so clearly decided that Question by your unimitable Works, that it saves sufficiently that trouble.

As there is variety of Sciences, so there are several sorts of Capacities to acquire them, some proving excellent in one kind, some in another; but to be capable of all, as well Philosophy as Playes, and Poems as Orations, be­longs only to a very few, whose Statues should be erected in all the eminent Places in the World, for their Glory, and our Admiration.

But yet, had I nothing else to say in excuse of my no ear­lier return to the last Noble effects of your Graces goodness, it were sufficient; That my sence of that mighty Honour was too big for my Pen; and when I began to speak my resentments of it, I found my self as unable to express them, as to deserve their oc­casion. Bet yet, Madam, this is not all the reason, for I was from home when your Grace's Present came, and have been so almost ever since; other­wise I had not added to my want of merit on other accounts, that also of appearing insensible, and de­fective in endeavours of acknowledgment; I must say endeavours, for my Gratitude can rise no higher. Since my receipt of your Grace's ingenious Works, I have, as my occasions would permit, cast my Eyes again into them, and I am sorry they cannot dwell there, where I find so pleasing, and so in­structive an entertainment. And though I must crave your Pardon for dissenting from your Grace's Opinion in some things, I admire the quickness, and vigor of your Conceptions, in all: In which your Grace hath this peculiar among Authors that they are, in the strictest sense, your own, your Grace being indebted to nothing for them, but your own happy Wit, and Genius; a thing so uncommon even among the most celebrated Writers of our Sex, that it ought to be acknowledged with wonder in yours. And really, Madam, your Grace hath set <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4330"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=51">[Page 99]</a></span> us a patern, that we ought to admire, but cannot imitate. And whereas you are pleased sometimes to mention your being no Scholar, as an excuse of de­fects, your modesty supposeth; By that acknow­ledgment you shew our imperfections that pretend we are so, rather than discover any of your own.</p><p>As for the last Trifle I was bold to present to your Graces Eye, it is much indebted to the ob­liging reception you were pleased to afford it; and the re is nothing that sets such a lustre on your Graces great Wit, and Intellectual Perfections, as that sweet candor of your Spirit that renders you so accessible, even to your meanest admirers. Where­as your Grace is pleased to object against some part of the design of my Discourse, that it sets the per­fection of the sense higher than that of Ratiocination; I humbly desire that your Grace would consider, that there are two sorts of Reasoning, <span class="hi">viz.</span> Those that the Mind advanceth from its own imbred <span class="hi">Idaea's</span> and native Store, such are all Metaphysical Contemplations. And those natural researches which are raised from experiment, and the objects of sense. The former are indeed most perfect when they are most abstracted from the grosness of things sensible, but the others are then most compleat when they are most accomodated to them; and when they are not, they are Aery, and Phantastick. Now what I have said about those matters is to tie down the mind in Physical things, to consider Nature as it is, to lay a Foundation in sensible collections, and from thence to proceed to general Propositions, and Discourses. So that my aim is, that we may arise according to the order of nature by degrees from the exercise of our Senses, to that of our Reasons; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4351"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=52">[Page 100]</a></span> which indeed is most noble and most perfect when it concludes aright, but not so when 'tis mistaken: And that it may so conclude and arrive to that per­fection, it must begin in sense: And the more ex­periments our reasons have to work on, by so much they are the more likely to be certain in their con­clusions, and consequently more perfect in their actings.

In which your Grace hath done right to one of the most Illustrious Hero's of our Age, and erected a lasting Monument to his Virtue. And in it, Madam, your Grace hath sweet­ly and wonderfully twisted the Faithfulness of an Historian, with the Affections of a Wife; And your Illustrious Lord hath in this an Honour beyond the other great Subjects of History, That his Grace hath not only as much deserved to be Celebrated as they, But hath moreover the happiness of the nearest Re­lation to an Heroine, whose Pen is as Glorious as his Sword. And 'tis not easy to say which is really the greater Wonder, the Famous Loyalty of that great Person, or the uncommon Excellence of the Pen that described it. But I must take up from a Sub­ject, in which, when I have said all I can, I shall be defective; and return to the last Letter wherewith your Grace was pleased to Honour me. For the business of Witches upon which your Grace reflects again in this, I have spoken many things more a­bout it in some Additions to my Considerations, which I am now sending to the Press.

Your Grace Madam, I know is a Person of so much Honour and Judgement, as not to take any thing amiss from my liberty in ex­pressing my apprehensions, which I use not to ob­trude upon any, but to propose to their Considera­tion and Enquiries; and for my self there is nothing obligeth me more than the knowledge of variety of Conceptions. There is a Discourse of mine ex­tant upon a Subject not very ordinary, which con­tains Notions which some excellent Persons have not despised, and are not usually met with in other Writings. I am inquiring after it for your Grace, and as soon as I can procure one (which is not very easy, that being out of Print) I shall submit it to your Grace's Judgement.

To this purpose, therefore, I am bold to send your Grace this rude Paper. Which yet I design, not as a Panegyric of your worth (for what affects us with admiration, strikes us also with dumbness: and Stars are best discerned by their own lustre) but as a short Scheme of my own grateful Sentiments. And if I be not so happy, to deliver them in Language agreeable to the dignity of the Subject, I humbly beseech you to consider, that such occasions offer themselves very rarely; and that nothing is more difficult, than to make the Pen observe <span class="hi">Decorum,</span> where Reason is put into disorder, Justice, <span class="hi">Ma­dam,</span> requires you should pardon the effects of that astonishment, whereof your Wonders are the cause.</p><p>They tell us, that the End of all Books is either profit, or pleasure: but I think that distinction (as many other in the Schools) might well be spared: because, in truth, profit supposeth pleasure; and pleasure is the greatest profit; nor am I ashamed to profess, that in all my reading I have no other aim but pleasure.

For I am zealous for the Reputation of my native Language, and of so communicative a temper, as to desire all men should participate of what I find delectable.

But this, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> was only my Wish: it is not now my Counsel. Should I here particularly recount to you, what the things were, that raised this so great delight in me, I should both offend by prolixity, and tacitly cast disparage­ment upon the rest.

For, while Men are Men, there will be different Interests, and consequently different Opinions: nor is the multitude of Follow­ers a certain sign of the Soundness, but of the Gain­fulness of any Doctrine. If, therefore, the World, which is obstinate (you know) and governed by pre­judice, will not be induced to esteem, what you think useful; the blame lyes not at your Door, and you ought to consolate your self with this reflexion; that you have sufficiently testified your good inten­tions, and done more than your Duty, in publishing your Conceptions. Befides, the <span class="hi">Virtuosi</span> of our <span class="hi">English</span> Universities have, of late years, proclamed open War against the tyranny of Dogmatizing in any Art or Science: and as for those of the <span class="hi">Roman Religion;</span> there is, I fear me, but little hope, of ma­king them your Proselites. Because those canting Polititians, called <span class="hi">School-men,</span> having made a new and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4877"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=58">[Page 113]</a></span> party-colour'd Vest for the Church, of a kind of Drugget, consisting of the Thrums of <span class="hi">Peripatetic</span> Philosophy, cunningly interwoven among the Gol­den threads of the Christian Faith; and prevailed, upon Princes to make it Piacular for any Scholar to appear with his Judgement clad in any other Livery: it is not very unlikely, the Professors there will soon be brought to offend their Superiors, by laying aside the defence of <span class="hi">Aristotle's</span> Maxims, to assume the Patronage of New. So that in my silly conceipt, as the Cabbage is observed to starve the Vine, if set too near: so the Philosophy of <span class="hi">Thomas Aquinas</span> and others of the same mystical Tribe, will hinder the growth of yours, in the same Ground.</p><p>For your <span class="hi">MORAL</span> Philosophy (for so I take liberty to call your occasional Reflections upon the Actions, Manners, and Fortunes of Men) Your Grace has not, indeed tied up your Pen to the la­borious rules of Method, or the formality of a new Systeme in <span class="hi">Ethics:</span> but (what is as well) you have opportunely, and under various heads, dispersed many useful remarks, concerning Prudence, as well Civil, as Domestic, in most of your Writings. And this, it may be presumed, you were pleased to do, not for want of Skill to reduce your rules of life into the order of dependence and connexion; but with de­sign, to shew your plenty, and surprize your Readers with good counsel even where they least expect it. You chose rather to regale us with delicate Fictions, under the veil whereof wholesom instructions are neatly contrived, than to embarass and tire us with the observation ofa long train of Precepts, which are never so effectual, as when naturally flowing from agreeable Instances and Examples. Your very in­terludes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4907"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=59">[Page 114]</a></span> contain adviso's, and your digressions are seasonably instructive: like wise Husbandmen, you plant Fruit-Trees in your Hedge-rows, and set Straw­berries and Rasberries among your Roses and Lil­lies. This, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> is a piece of no small art, though not obvious to common Eyes: and if any dislike the course you have taken in thus scattering and disguising your <span class="hi">Morals;</span> I would have him asked this Question, Whether or no it be folly for a man to refuse to gather Oranges and Citrons, only be­cause the trees that offer them, are not ranged in the Order of <span class="hi">Cyrus's Quincunx?</span> or whether a Nosegay be less fragrant, because pluck'd from Flowers grow­ing dispersedly? To all who have read your <span class="hi">Comi­cal Tales,</span> with the same purity of Mind, with which you wrote them; and are withal qualified to search into the Mythology of all your imaginary <span class="hi">Dialogues:</span> to all such, I say, it is evident, that you have drawn the Images of all the <span class="hi">Virtues,</span> on one hand, and their opposite <span class="hi">Vices,</span> on the other, so much to the life; that men, beholding them, must be, by grateful violence, compelled to love the Pulchritude of those, and abhor the deformity of these. Now, this, <span class="hi">Ma­dam,</span> you could not have done had you not first had the <span class="hi">Idea's</span> of all Virtues within your self: it being absolutely necessary for a Painter, first to conceive the form or similitude of the thing he intends to re­present, in his own Imagination; and then to make the resemblance according to that form. So that in strictness of truth, those Pictures we call <span class="hi">Originals,</span> are but Copies, yea Copies of Copies: as being first drawn from the life in the Phantasy, and after pourtrai'd upon Tables. Besides this, your Grace is further happy, in that the <span class="hi">Morals</span> of your <span class="hi">Pen</span> are <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4962"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=59">[Page 115]</a></span> clearly exemplified in those of your <span class="hi">Life;</span> in which I have never heard any thing blamed, any thing di­sputed, unless whether it hath been more <span class="hi">Innocent,</span> or more <span class="hi">Obliging.</span> In fine, the Documents of both your <span class="hi">Pen</span> and <span class="hi">Life</span> seem to be so good, that who­ever is able to moderate his Passions, and regulate his Actions by them, needs not to seek further af­ter <span class="hi">Happiness:</span> nor need I fear to pronounce him ar­rived at such perfection, that it will not be easy for him to be brought to do ill, either out of <span class="hi">Weakness,</span> or out of <span class="hi">Design.</span></p><p>For your <span class="hi">POETRY;</span> therein your Grace hath more than a single advantage above others.</p><p><span class="hi">First,</span> Your Vein appears equally facile, equally free, and copious upon all occasions, in all sorts of arguments. The Buskin and the Sock are equally fit for your Muses Legs. Your Phansy is too ge­nerous to be restrained: Your Invention too nimble to be fettered. Hence it is, that you do not always confine your Sense to Verse; nor your Verses to Rhythme; nor your Rhythme to the quantity and sounds of Sillables. Your Descriptions, Expressions, Similies, Allegories, Metaphors, Epithets, Num­bers, all flow in upon you of their own accord, and in full Tides: and Verses stand ready minted in the Treasury of your Brain, as Tears in some Womens Eyes, waiting to be called forth. So that in you is verified the Doctrine of <span class="hi">Plato,</span> in his <span class="hi">Dialogue</span> in­titled <span class="hi">Io;</span> that <span class="hi">Poesy</span> is not a faculty proceeding from judgement, or acquired by labour and industry; but a certain divine Fury, or <span class="hi">Enthusiasm,</span> which scorning the controle of Reason, transports the Spirit in Rap­tures, as <span class="hi">Jove's</span> Eagle did <span class="hi">Ganymed,</span> or as Witches are said to be wafted above the Clouds on the wings <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5039"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=60">[Page 116]</a></span> of their Familiars. Which is, perhaps, the ground of that old saying, <span class="hi">nemo fit Poeta,</span> no Poet is made, but born so: as the rage and liberty of a Poetic Ge­nius gave occasion to paint <span class="hi">Pegasus</span> with Wings, in a flying posture, and without a Bridle.</p><p><span class="hi">Secondly,</span> In your whole <span class="hi">Oglio</span> of Poems, I find nothing which is not intirely <span class="hi">Your own.</span> Like good Housewifes in the Countrey, you, make a Feast wholly of your own provisions: yea, even the Dressing, Sawces, and Garniture of the Dishes are <span class="hi">Your own.</span> And were <span class="hi">Perilius Faustinus</span> revived (he, who out of envy to the Glory of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> made and published a large Catalogue of his Thefts from <span class="hi">Homer</span> and <span class="hi">Hesiod</span>) he could hardly discover so much as a single Verse borrowed, by you, from any Poet, antient or modern. So circumspect you are to avoid being thought a Plagiary, that you walk not in beaten Paths, but decline even the rules and methods of your Predecessors, and scorn Imitation, as a kind of Theft. A commendation, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> due to very few, perhaps to none besides your self. As your Grace, therefore, owes all your Poesy to the inspi­ration of your own happy Genius alone; so we owe all the Pleasure we are sensible of in reading your Poems, to you alone. I may have many rivals in these my thankful acknowledgements, you can have no Competitor in the Glory of their occasi­ons.</p><p>This double Felicity is augmented by the accession of two others, no less worthy admiration. <span class="hi">One</span> is, that as you have made your self an <span class="hi">Original,</span> so are you likewise secure from being <span class="hi">Copied.</span> You have indeed, given the world an illustrious Example; but you have given what it cannot take, the Example <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5094"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=60">[Page 117]</a></span> being of that height, that it is hardly attainable. You provoke our Emulation, and at the same time cast us into despair. Your Poetical Fancies rather brave, than instruct our capacities: and by setting before our Eyes things inimitable, you vex our ambition, and oblige us to an unprofitable trouble.</p><p><span class="hi">Another</span> is, that you exceed all of your delicate Sex, not only in this age, but in all ages past. It would puzle the best Historian to find your Parallel among the most famous Women: and in the Mo­numents of the <span class="hi">Roman</span> greatness, even while that Glorious Nation held the Empire as well of Virtue and Wit, as that of the World, I cannot meet with an <span class="hi">Heroine,</span> to whom I dare to compare you. There are, I confess, who tell us of a Noble <span class="hi">Roman</span> Lady, one <span class="hi">Sulpitia,</span> who composed a History of <span class="hi">Domiti­an's</span> times, in Hexametre Verses, and wrote many Elegant Poems besides; and who hath been highly celebrated by <span class="hi">Martial, Tibullus, Sidonius Apollinaris,</span> and of late by <span class="hi">Scaliger</span> also, as an eminent Pattern both of a Chast and Immaculate Life, and of a neat Poetical Wit: and once I had some thoughts of drawing a Parallel betwixt that Lady and your Grace. But, upon a second examination of the par­ticular Remarks, wherein I had fansied the resem­blance chiefly to consist; and a more serious review of the Story of her Life, and the remains of her Pen, (extant among the <span class="hi">Fragments</span> of <span class="hi">Latine Po­ets,</span> and usually annexed to <span class="hi">Petronius Arbiter</span>) I perceived, I could not proceed in that resolution, without disadvantage on your part, by a conference so unequal; and thereupon resumed my former co­gitation, that your Grace's Statue ought to be placed <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5145"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=61">[Page 118]</a></span> alone, and at the upper end, in the <span class="hi">Gallery of Heroic Women,</span> and upon a Pedestal more advanced than the rest. We read not that Nature hath been so Prodi­gal of her choicest Largesses, as to produce two <span class="hi">Cice­ro's,</span> or two <span class="hi">Virgil's,</span> or two <span class="hi">Ben Johnson's:</span> why, then, should we seek after your Equal? It was their glory to be single: and it must be yours, to have no Peer, for ought we know, you are the <span class="hi">First</span> great Lady, that ever Wrote so much and so much of your own: and, for ought we can divine, you will also be the <span class="hi">Last.</span></p><p>These, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> are a few of those swarms of thoughts that crowded into my unquiet Head, when I proposed to my self to express some part at least of the great Honour and Reverence I owe your Grace. If I have so far obeyed the impulse of my Gratitude and Devotion, as to put them into Words, and offer them to your knowledge; it was not, I as­sure you, out of a vain conceipt, that they were answerable either to your vast Merits, or to my Obli­gations; but meerly upon Confidence, you would descend to exercise your Goodness and Candor, in receiving them as a simple recognition of both. And if I have suppressed the rest; it was out of good Manners, and a due fear of farther offending your Patience. I am not ignorant, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> that our Prayers to God, and our Addresses to Princes ought to be short. Resigning you, therefore, to the conversa­tion of your own more ingenious and useful thoughts, and to the Tranquill Fruition of those intellectual pleasures, that continually spring up in you from the Virtues of your Life, and the Fame of your Wri­tings; I most humbly beg your favourable Inter­pretation <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5189"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=61">[Page 119]</a></span> of what I have here weakly said, and with all Submission imaginable, cast my self at your Feet, as becomes</p><div class="closer"><div class="dateline">From my House in Covent-Garden May 7. 1667.</div> Your Graces, Just Honourer, and most Intirely Devoted Servant, <div class="signed">Walter Charleton.</div></div></div><div lang="eng" class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.59"><h3 lang="eng"><span class="headingNumber">2.59. </span></h3><div class="opener"><div class="salute">MADAM,</div></div><p>I Had the Honour to hear so good Solutions given by your Excellency upon divers Que­stions moved in a whole Afternoon, you was pleased to bestow upon my unworthy Conversati­on, that I am turning to School with all speed, humbly beseeching your Excellence may be so boun­tiful towards my Ignorance, as to Instruct me about the Natural Reason of those Wonderful Glasses, which, as I told you, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> will fly into Powder, if one breaks but the least top of their tails: whereas without that way they are hardly to be broken by any weight or strength.

As for your Inquiry about the Plastick Faculties; I Answer, that they are those, whereby the Body is formed at first, and by which the Alimental Juices, are after, through the whole course of Life, orderly distribu­ted for the purposes of growth and nutrition: But whether, as your <span class="hi">Grace</span> inquires, they are Faculties inherent, in the Soul, or are only Mechanical Mo­tions <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5382"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=64">[Page 124]</a></span> of the Body I cannot determine certainly. But I rather incline to the <span class="hi">Platonists,</span> who will have the Soul to be the Bodies Maker, and they affirm (as is ordinary; though with some diversity in the Names and Presentation) That there are three sorts of Faculties, which they Phancy as Analogous parts, or Regions in the Soul, <span class="hi">(Viz.)</span> The <span class="hi">Mind,</span> so they call the highest Faculties of abstract Reason, and Understanding, which is the <span class="hi">First.</span> The <span class="hi">Second</span> they call the <span class="hi">Soul, (Viz.)</span> as it is united to the Body, and exerciseth the operation of Sense. The <span class="hi">Third,</span> is the Image of the <span class="hi">Soul,</span> which is those Fa­culties, that are called Plastical, that move and turn the Body, but are devoid of Understanding, or Sense; Now how the <span class="hi">Soul,</span> which is Immaterial, can manage and order Corporeal Motions is a dif­ficulty of which Philosophy as yet hath given no account, as I have particularly taken notice, and proved in my <span class="hi">Sceptis Scientifica,</span> but yet the thing ought not therefore to be denied, because the man­ner of the most obvious sensible things is to us un­known; And by this we can only prove, that we have yet nocertain Theory of Nature: And, in good earnest, Madam, all that we can hope for, as yet, is but the History of things as they are, but to say how they are, to raise general <span class="hi">Axioms,</span> and to make <span class="hi">Hypotheses,</span> must, I think, be the happy priviledge of succeeding Ages; when they shall have gained a larger account of the <span class="hi">Phoenomena,</span> which yet are too scant and defective to raise Theories upon: so that to be ingenious and confess freely, we have yet no such thing as Natural Philosophy; Natural History is all we can pretend to; and that too, as yet, is but in its Rudiments, the advance of it your <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5434"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=64">[Page 125]</a></span> <span class="hi">Grace</span> knows is the design and business of the <span class="hi">Royal Society;</span> from whom we may reasonably at last expect better grounds for general Doctrines, than any the World yet hath been acquainted with; but this, Ma­dam, is an excursion. I therefore return to your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Letter, which inquires some things, about my No­tion of the <span class="hi">Souls</span> Original: As to this I would not be understood to affirm peremptorily a thing, which the greatest part of Men, neither have, nor can re­ceive, only I consider it as an <span class="hi">Hypothesis,</span> that may be taken up to satisfy those minds that are much troubled at the seeming inequalities of Providence; and whether true, or false, this I will take the bold­ness to be confident in, That the Doctrine of the <span class="hi">Souls Praeexistence,</span> doth best suit with the appearan­ces of the World. And best Answers for the Di­vine Justice and Goodness, in all the affairs of Pro­vidence; In this Madam, I am a little <span class="hi">Dogmatical,</span> and this step further, I think I may take, without im­modesty; That the Doctrine hath so much to say for it self, from Reason, and the highest Antiquity, as to render it fit to be considered, and indeed, since the two other wayes, are confessedly desperate, me­thinks there should be no harm in examining this; which is all I pretend to. But particularly to your <span class="hi">Grace's Quaery,</span> Whether were <span class="hi">Souls</span> Created or Un­created? I Answer, no doubt Created: But then I do not see how that follows, which your <span class="hi">Grace</span> is pleased to infer, <span class="hi">Viz.</span> That Sin was then Created, For our <span class="hi">Souls</span> in their State were Spotless and Innocent, as the Angels of God. That Mankind was so first, and fell by a voluntary Transgression, is the com­mon Doctrine; and how we may suppose it was par­ticularly in the way of <span class="hi">Praeexistence,</span> your <span class="hi">Grace</span> will <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5506"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=65">[Page 126]</a></span> see easily, when I shall have procured that Book of mine, I have mentioned, and promised your <span class="hi">Grace,</span> but cannot yet light on. The other part also of your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Division: <span class="hi">Viz.</span> That if those <span class="hi">Souls</span> were Eternal, they are Gods; is I humbly conceive a mistake likewise, since though the World, had been Created from Eternity (which even the Schools confess possible) it had nevertheless been a Creature, by reason of its dependence upon another, for its being, and to have been produced, and yet from Eternity, is no absurdity, our Faith affirms it, in the Eternal Generation of the Son, and Procession of the Holy-Ghost, and to take an instance with which we may make more bold: If the Sun had been from Eternity no doubt it would have shone E­ternally, and yet it's Beams had been effects and de­pendent; And whereas your <span class="hi">Grace</span> saith again, That what is Immaterial is a God: I must here also take the boldness, to enter my Dissent to your Propo­sition; Indeed Mr. <span class="hi">Hobbs</span> denys all Immateriality to Created Beings, but I think upon grounds preca­rious and unsafe, That our <span class="hi">Souls</span> are Immaterial in their Natures, hath been sufficiently proved by some late Philosophers; particularly by the most learned Dr. <span class="hi">H. Moore,</span> and I also have done something about this, in my Book of <span class="hi">Praeexistence,</span> If your <span class="hi">Grace</span> de­mands my Reasons; they shall be ready at the least intimation, of those commands which I shall ever account a singular Honour to observe. For the anti­quity of <span class="hi">Praeexistence,</span> which your <span class="hi">Grace</span> rightly ob­serves, to be no certain Argument of the truth of it, I humbly say I have not alledged it, for a demon­stration of the thing, but to take off the prejudice we are apt to have against all supposed Novelties, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5564"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=65">[Page 127]</a></span> and to shew that it is not so despicable, an <span class="hi">Hypothe­sis</span> but that several great minds of former times, even in the Ages of the best Antiquity have owned a kindness for it, and consequently that we cannot, without some immodesty, deny it a favourable hear­ing, But madam, I forget my self, and the consi­deration I ought to have of your <span class="hi">Grace's</span> Time and Patience, and therefore only add, that I am,</p><div class="closer"><div class="dateline">Bath, Octob. 13. 1667.</div> Illustrious Madam, Your Graces Most Obedient Servant, <div class="signed">Jos.

Alas, <span class="hi">Ma­dam,</span> that is an Office we dare not assume, not only without censure of Arrogance, but even of Impro­priety; for seeing that every one is to be judged by their Peeres, who shall undertake to be Judge of that that hath no Peer?

Two things do justly leave us, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> under a surprize and admiration of your Excellencies great Production; First, that it should proceed from a Per­son of so high Honour and Fortune; for Ignorance in such things as those is appointed by the World unto such Estates, and thought a kind of Preroga­tive belonging unto Wealth: And next, that it should proceed from a Sex unaccustomed to, and commonly excused from such painful and elevated Inquisitions. For (as your Excellency hath ob­served) men do assign to your Sex nothing but va­nities, and Trifles for their Portion, and under co­lour of Courtship do confine them in their Educa­tion only to some inferiour Qualities, and so in ef­fect but to a kind of delicate Barbarism: But herein your Excellency hath shew'd great Courage in breaking through that Obstruction, and by a Fe­male and unusual Chevalry have rescued your whole Nation and Sex from the oppression and injury in this point, and of that great Giant, the World.

But if ever any thing happen within the reach of my indeavours, by which I may serve or gratify your Grace, I shall then give evidence of the great resentment I have of this condescention, and the Veneration which is due to a Person of so obliging and so unusual a Virtue. Your Grace, I know, is Nobly inquisitive, and hath a rich stock of generous Apprehensions; and Persons of this Character use to be pleased in the persual of the va­riety of others Conceptions; And on this account I presume, that those notions I sometimes entertain my self with, may not be unacceptable, being not alto­gether of the road and common track. And if your Grace please to permit, and pardon my Importuni­ties, I shall take occasion to give you my sense of some things that are not of the meanest concern­ments. For the present I am obliged to answer the particulars of your Grace's Letter, in which your Grace hath very much obliged me by those argu­ments you are pleased to excuse; and to them I make this humble return.</p><p>1. That whereas your Grace calls the Induce­ments to the belief of Witches, <span class="hi">probable Arguments,</span> I am apt, with submission, to think some of them to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6018"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=71">[Page 138]</a></span> be as great demonstrations as matter of Fact can bear; being no less than the evidence of the Senses, and Oaths of sober Attestors, and the critical inquiries of Sagacious, and suspitious Persons; which Circum­stances of Evidence, your grace knows, some of those Relations have to prove them. And there is a particular Story which is sufficiently famous, and of part of which I my self was a Witness, which I think is not subject to just Exception. 'Tis that of the Drum in the House of Mr. <span class="hi">Mompession</span> of <span class="hi">Tedworth</span> in <span class="hi">Wiltshire.</span> Of this, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> I shall take an occasion to give your Grace a particular ac­count, if you have not yet been acquainted with the circumstances of that unusual disturbance. But to confine my self now to your Grace's considerations on the subject; The second thing I observe, is,</p><p>The intimation of an Argument against the Ex­istence of Witches, because <span class="hi">they are not mentioned by Christ, and his Apostles,</span> concerning which I humbly desire your Grace to consider.</p><p>1. That Negative Arguments from Scripture use not often to be of any great signification or validity. Our Saviour spake as he had occasion, and the thou­sandth part of what he said, or what he did, is not recorded, as one Evangelist intimates. He said no­thing of those large unknown Tracts of <span class="hi">America,</span> gives no intimations of the Existence of that nume­rous People, much less any instructions about their Conversion. He gives no particular account of the affairs and state of the other World, but only that general one, of the happiness of some, and the mi­sery of others. He makes no discovery of the <span class="hi">Mag­nalia</span> of Art, or Nature, no not of those whereby the propagation of the Gospel might have been <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6063"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=71">[Page 139]</a></span> much advanced; <span class="hi">viz.</span> The Mystery of <span class="hi">Printing,</span> and the <span class="hi">Magnet.</span> And yet no one useth his Si­lence in these Instances as an Argument against the being of things, which are the evident Objects of Sense. I confess the omission of some of these particulars is pretty strange and unaccountable, and an argument of our Ignorance of the Reasons and Menages of Providence, but I suppose of nothing else; or if it were, I crave leave to add,</p><p>2. That the Gospel is not without intimations of Sorcery, and contracts with evil Spirits. The ma­licious <span class="hi">Jews</span> said our Saviour did his Miracles by their assistance, <span class="hi">He casts out Devils by</span> Beezebub. And he denys not the supposition or possibility of the thing in general, but clears himself by an appeal to the Actions of their own Children, whom they would not so severely criminate. And besides this,</p><p>3. The Apostles had intimations plain enough of the being of Sorcery and Witchcraft, as seems to me evident from <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 3.1. <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 5.20. <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 9.21. <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 21.8. <span class="hi">Rev,</span> 22.15.</p><p>'Tis very true as your Grace suggests, that Su­perstition and Ignorance of Causes make Men many times to impute the Effects of Art, and Nature, to Witchcraft and Diabolick Contract. And the Com­mon People think God, or the Devil to be in every thing extraordinary. But yet, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> your Grace may please to consider, That there are things done by mean and despicable persons, transcending all the Arts of the most knowing and improv'd <span class="hi">Virtuosi,</span> and above all the Essays of known and ordinary Nature. So that we either must suppose that a sottish silly old Woman hath more knowledge of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6115"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=72">[Page 140]</a></span> the intrigues of Art, and Nature, than the most ex­ercised Artists, and Philosophers, or confess that those strange things they performe, are done by con­foederacy with evil Spirits, who, no doubt, act those things by the ways and applications of Nature, though such as are to us unknown. This, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> is, I conceive, as much as is necessary to be said to the Argumentative part of your Graces excellent Letter.</p><p>As for the following Periods, I am mostly of the same Opinion with your Grace, in the way that I understand them. Nature is in a continual motion (for there is no such thing as Rest in the World) and perhaps that is not purely Mechanical, but may, in great part (at least as to the beginnings and directi­ons of it) be ascribed to the Soul of the World, which possibly is the great <span class="hi">Archeus</span> that formes Plants, Animals, and other more curious <span class="hi">Phoenomena.</span> And there is no doubt but (as your Grace suggests) that much wickedness is caused by the meer impulse of Lower Nature; and I believe several Men are determined to Actions of Vice by the odness of their particular make and contexture. But whereas your Grace saith that nothing but God himself can be perfect, I cannot so well understand that. <span class="hi">Absolutely so, and in all kinds,</span> 'tis true, I grant it, but your Grace doth not seem to intend the proposition in that sense. And to be Perfect in a lower kind is but to have all the parts and faculties that are re­quisite to such a being, in that order, disposition, and all other circumstances which are suitable to its <span class="hi">Idea,</span> and proper for its respective ends. And in this sense I think all things are perfect in their first con­stitution; according to what your Grace saith af­terwards, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6148"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=72">[Page 141]</a></span> That [God cannot create any Imper­fection, being absolute Perfection himself] which appositely fits mine, but I can not see how it so well consists with your Graces former assertion, except it be intended to infer, <span class="hi">That God made nothing;</span> a Proposition which methinks your Grace should not own; but some things that follow seem to look that way, when you are pleased to say [Neither can I conceive how God could actually make or act any thing, either in a Mechanical manner, or a Free, being not locally moving] To which I humbly say that if your Grace doubts the possibility of the Cre­ation out of nothing, I think I can speak some things as a Philosopher, that may render it rea­sonable. Nor is actual motion in the Deity neces­sary to his actions, since he is Immense and needs not local motion to render him present by his Essence, or his Virtue, to any place of the great Universe, being Eternally there by the Infinity of his being, and his Power. And whereas your Grace is plea­sed to say, that God is no Mechanick, I consent that He is not so properly, in that he needs not material Instruments to act by. But yet he hath made all things by a kind of Geometry; in Number, Weight, and Measure, saith the <span class="hi">Holy Oracle.</span> And there is a sort of Mathematics in all the Works of Na­ture.</p><p>Thus, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> I have made bold with your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Patience, in confidence of your Candor, and your goodness, which I implore, for the Pardon of this Voluminous Trouble.

For me to have sat among the Multitude, whom your Sta­tioner invites to feast upon your <span class="hi">OLIO,</span> had been proportionable enough to the degree of so ordinary a Judgement, as mine: but to be among those few, whom your self had nominated for your Chief Guests, was a Grace infinitely above my Ambi­tion.</p><p><span class="hi">Secondly,</span> You have benefited my <span class="hi">Understanding;</span> in that your <span class="hi">Philosophical Phancies</span> have furnished me with variety of such Novel Conceipts, concern­ing sundry the most difficult Problems in Nature; as that if my Memory be but faithful enough to retain them, I shall never be unprovided of somwhat that is poynant and grateful, to entertain Curiosity withall: and whenever my own Reason is at a loss, how to investigate the Causes of some Natural Se­cret <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6276"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=74">[Page 144]</a></span> or other, I shall relieve the Company with some one pleasant and unheard of Conjecture of yours. So that by reading of your <span class="hi">Philosophy,</span> I have acqui­red thus much of advantage; that where I cannot Satisfy, I shall be sure to Delight: which is some­what more than I dare promise from any other Discourses of the same Title; in so much as they generally leave the Mind in a kind of Anxiety and Regret, when ever they fail to afford it Satisfaction. And, certainly, if it be (as some hold) reasonable to allow, that the Fictions of Poets, and Roman­cists do usually take as strong hold of mens Minds, and Charm their Affections as powerfully, as the most Authentique Narrations of Historians; though the Reader well understands the Passages related by these, to be certain Truths, and the adventures de­scribed by Those, to be meerly Imaginary; and this, because Delight is equal on both sides: if this, I say, be justifiable, that man can run but little hazard of his Judgement, who shall affirm, that your Suppo­sition of Fayeries in the Brain, and of our Thoughts being their Consults and Suggestions; and your opini­on that the Fayeries digging for Stones in the Quar­ries of the Teeth, to repair their decay'd Tenements in the Head, is the Cause of the Tooth-ach; are as worthy the hearing, as the most solid demonstrative Theory of any Philosopher whatever; insomuch as these may yield both as high and lasting a Delight as that. I say Delight as High and Lasting; for, to speak my Thoughts clearly, the Pleasure that ariseth from the comprehension of the most perfect and la­borious Demonstration in <span class="hi">Geometry,</span> I never could find, either in height or duration, much to exceed that, which I have sometime been affected withall, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6301"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=74">[Page 145]</a></span> at the recital of a Facetious Poetical Extravagancy, of which I had not afore heard. Nor do I believe, that the Raptures, and Exultations of <span class="hi">Don Quixot</span> were much inferior to that famous one of <span class="hi">Archimed,</span> which transported him out of himself, as well as out of the Bath, into a loud Exclamation, <span class="hi">I have found it, I have found it.</span> And the Reason of this Equa­lity may be well enough thought, to consist chiefly in the unsatisfiedness of our Nature, which always hurrying our Minds on to Novelties, causeth us to put an equally cheap rate upon all things we think already in the possession of our Understanding; and to value acquest of a fresh, though perhaps useless, and absurd Opinion, above the calm fruition of an­tient and irregular Maxims. But, this <span class="hi">(Madam)</span> being a Paradox, ought to have more room, than can be spred in a Letter, whose design'd Argu­ment is Thankfulness: and besides, should I adven­ture further, to avouch it, the same could not but much redound to my disadvantage; insomuch as it might render me suspected for something of a Scho­lar, and consequently incapable of the Honour and Pleasure of sometimes attending you, and hearing your more than ingenious Discourses. For as I re­member, in one of your Prefaces, or Epistles to your Readers, you have been pleased expresly to declare; <span class="hi">That you never Conversed, so much as one Hour, with any Philosopher, or Professed Scholar, in your whole Life:</span> and that, doubtless, must have proceeded from your constant Aversion to such blunt Company; not from your want of opportunities to hear what they could say. Because, being always Educated among the Noblest, and most Knowing Persons of our Nation; you could hardly escape the Conver­sation <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6335"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=75">[Page 146]</a></span> of the most Learned in all the Arts and Sci­ences; unless you purposely withdrew your self from their Society, or shut your Ears against their Dis­courses.</p><p>But, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> among those, who have perused your Writings, I meet with a sort of Infidels, who refuse to believe, that you have alwayes preserved your self so free from the Contagion of Books, and Book-men. And the Reason they give me, is this; that you frequently use many Terms of the Schools, and sometimes seem to have Imp'd the Wings of your high-flying Phansy with sundry Feathers ta­ken out of the Universities, or Nests of <span class="hi">Divines, Philosophers, Phisicians, Geometricians, Astronomers,</span> and the rest of the Gowned Tribe. For instance, of <span class="hi">Divines,</span> when you speak of <span class="hi">Praedestination, Free will, Transubstantiation, &amp;c.</span> Of <span class="hi">Philosophers,</span> when you mention <span class="hi">Quantity, Discrete</span> and <span class="hi">Continued,</span> the <span class="hi">Uni­versal</span> and <span class="hi">First Matter, Attoms, Elements, Motion, Dilatation,</span> and <span class="hi">Contraction, Rarefaction,</span> and <span class="hi">Conden­sation, Meteors, &amp;c.</span> Of <span class="hi">Physicians,</span> when you distin­guish of <span class="hi">Choler, Phlegme, Melancholy,</span> and <span class="hi">Blood,</span> and speak of the <span class="hi">Circulation of the Blood,</span> of <span class="hi">Venricles</span> in the <span class="hi">Heart</span> and <span class="hi">Brain,</span> of <span class="hi">Veins, Arteries,</span> and <span class="hi">Nerves,</span> and expatiate upon <span class="hi">Fevers, Apoplexies, Convulsions, Droqsies,</span> and divers other Diseases, with their particular Causes, Symptoms, and Cures: Of <span class="hi">Geometricians,</span> when you touch upon <span class="hi">Triangles, Squares, Circles, Diameters, Circumferences, Centres, Lines,</span> streight and crooked, and their proportions each to other, and that invin­cible Problem, the <span class="hi">Quadrature of the Circle:</span> Of <span class="hi">Astronomers,</span> when you speak of the <span class="hi">Horizon, Me­ridian, Aequator, Zodiack, Ecliptick, Tropicks, Poles of the World,</span> and of the <span class="hi">Ecliptick,</span> and in a manner <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6441"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=75">[Page 147]</a></span> run over the whole Doctrine of the Sphere, repre­senting the model of the Universe, and cast some transitory glances also upon the Doctrine Theorical concerning the Motions of the Orbs, and Pla­nets. Nor can I, indeed, hope to dissolve the stif­ness of these mens unbelief; untill I shall be better able to convince them, that all these Scholastical Terms and Notions may be brought into the World with us, and afterwards drawn forth of the Soul, by solitary Meditation, and the labour of ones own Thoughts; and are not rather instilled into it, and imprest upon it, by often Hearing, or Reading the Discourses of others, who profess those Arts and Sciences to which they belong, and for the more plain and methodical teaching whereof, they were first Invented and Recorded. But I fear me, while I insist thus particularly upon the Reason alleadged by these men, in defence of their Diffidence; I may fall into the same danger, for the avoidance of which, I even now left my Paradox destitute of Assertion: and therefore I lay by that subject, and take up another more opportune and considerable, as to the discharge of my Duty, and confessing how many wayes you have obliged me.</p><p>I acknowledge, therefore, in the last place; that my <span class="hi">Affections</span> must own you for their Benefactress. For those many Moral Apothegms, and Satyrical Remarques upon the Manners of Men and Wo­men, which you have frequently inspersed upon the Leaves of your Book, are so pathetically delivered, and with such vigour of proper and familiar Lan­guage press'd home to the Bosome of every man; as that that person must be irrecover ably lost in the darkness of Vice, who doth not, through thhm, clearly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6458"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=76">[Page 148]</a></span> discern the Lustre and Amiableness of Virtue, and thereupon instantly abominate his former Deformi­ties, and become your perfect Proselite. When a Young, Noble, Beautiful, Witty, and Sprightly Lady, one on whom all the Pleasures of the World seem to be Enamoured, and in throngs offer them­selves to be accepted and commanded by her; when such an one, I say is heard to Preach up <span class="hi">Temperance, Abstinence, Modesty, Chastity, Solitude,</span> and the suppression of all irregular sensual Appetites. What <span class="hi">Sardanapalus</span> is there, who must not blush at the me­mory of his Vicious Acts, and being convinced, that the delights of a Soul, well ordered according to the rules of Virtue and Honour, are infinitely more charming and desirable, than the most magnified Pleasures of the Body, swimming in an Ocean of Luxury, and Laciviousness; firmly resolve with him­self, thenceforth to seek for Felicity, not in the short Titillations and Blandishments of the Senses, but in the Purity and constant Serenity of the Mind. Is it possible, that any of our Ladies, should retain her pretences of <span class="hi">Platonick Love,</span> or continue the practise of her petty Arts of Daubing and Painting, of Dis­sembling, Medisanse, and Detraction: after she hath once read your smart Invectives against them, and solid Arguments to shew, that they may all be justly suspected for Bawds to procure and conceal the fruition of that Pleasure, which doth not con­sist in the admiring conversation of Souls, but in the close Conjunction of Bodies, and the satisfaction of that rank Appetite of the Flesh, commonly called Lust? In a word; what Sex, Age, Constitution, Condition is there, whose most secret Ulcers, the sharpness of your Wit and Pen hath not launced <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6483"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=76">[Page 149]</a></span> open to the bottom; and afterward prescribed most easy and certain Remedies for the Cure of them? So that I may well conclude this Paragraph with saying that your Moral Essayes contain wise Pre­cepts enough in them, for the Reformation of the Age we live in, and that, certainly, is so bad that no Man need ever fear a worse.</p><p>And, now, Incomparable <span class="hi">Madam,</span> having done my Homage to you, in token of what I hold by the tenure of your Wit and Bounty, it remains, that I humbly beg your Pardon for the rude and tedious manner of it. And that, I hope, you will grant me, when you have considered, that the Devotion may be sincere, where the Ceremonies are imperfect; and I have assured you, that I will never omit to pay you those Dues of Thanks, and constant Observance, that belong to you, from me, as one whom your Goodness hath made,</p><div class="closer"><div class="dateline">London, January 1. 1654.</div> Your Eternal Honourer, and Faithful Servant, <div class="signed">W.

Your <span class="hi">Graces</span> goodness having this, peculiar and above others, that 'tis neither forced by Solicitations of Friends, nor Importunities of Petitions, but voluntary and of its own accord flowes out, and delivers it self. Truely every more than ordinary Spirit is powerfully drawn out to what is like it self, invites, embraceth, and preserves, whatever bears the name of any kind of Excellency, as allyed to it. But how truely Mag­nificent is this of your <span class="hi">Grace,</span> that the Arts them­selves, by your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Example, are render'd more August and Venerable? How shall future Ages stoop under the weight of your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Fame, that your <span class="hi">Grace</span> in that Nobility of Extract, and conflu­ence of Fortune, should yet outvie in the Methods of Learning, even those, whose necessities must prompt them to diligence? Wherein your <span class="hi">Grace</span> hath made so happy a progress, that never any can more appear, a Devotist to, or Proficient in Learn­ing: so that your <span class="hi">Graces</span> teeming Brain is ever bring­ing forth some new Miracle: and though a Wo­man, yet hath merited the Diadem of Learning be­fore Men; though a Courtier, yet before the Aca­demicks: In a word, wherein any one, is in any thing Excellent, yet is your <span class="hi">Grace</span> in that thing far more excellent. Nor can we believe, that any mortal Man, no not your <span class="hi">Grace</span> our Princess (with your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Pardon) can from Natures instinct, or humane strength be excited and raised to so manifold <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6581"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=56934&amp;page=77">[Page 151]</a></span> and profound Speculations. It must necessary, be that that most capacious Soul of your <span class="hi">Grace,</span> expa­tiating it self so far into all sorts of Learning, is Di­vinely inspired; that almost Infinite Comprehension of so many and so great Notions informes us, how great a measure of the Heavenly Spirit hath possest your <span class="hi">Grace;</span> and that no single Deity hath enlarged this one Soul unto the Immense Tracts of all the Sci­ences. With these happy Omens hath your <span class="hi">Grace</span> reached unto, whatever in the Arts seemed good unto your <span class="hi">Grace</span> when some Diviner <span class="hi">Genius</span> of your <span class="hi">Grace</span> our Princess, judged the No­tion of any clear Truth, would be beneficial. And whereas it was your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Work, not to give Rea­sons, but Magisterially to Prononce, as from an Oracle; (yet such is your <span class="hi">Graces</span> condescention) that all your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Tenets are asserted and con­firmed with most Cogent Arguments: as if we did not owe a Belief, and had not a certain Devotion obliging our Assent to your <span class="hi">Graces</span> bare Assertion. Henceforth therefore do we Destine our spare hours unto these kinds of Studies, and are reaching unto the perfection of Philosophy, seeing your <span class="hi">Grace</span> hath judged these Speculations such as are worthy your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Intentions, and nearer <span class="hi">Approximations:</span> for such an happy clearness of Wit shall render every theng discoverable and fully to be comprehended, and that most free inclinination of your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Can­dor will communicate every thing discovered to your <span class="hi">Graces Cantabrigians.</span> Yet lest we should give our selves up to unworthy Ease, and Consecrate our selves to Sloth, your <span class="hi">Grace</span> hath left us one very difficult Task, namely Thankfulness.
