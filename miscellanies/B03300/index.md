## 1\. The Enchanted LOVER, Or, Celia Triumphant. Being a moſt pleaſant new
Court Song.

Conquered by love enchanted Strephon ſings,

Whilſt the loves god his flames fans with his wings,

And makes him Celia praiſe unto the Skies,

Beauty and Celia now are all he cryes,

Tranſported by his paſſion and her eyes,

Thus Amorous Youth are caught in Cupids net,

Which the enchanting fair Doves daily ſet.

To a pleaſant new Playhouſe Tune.

AH! how pleaſant are the charms of Love,

which like Streams are alwaies flowing

Ah! how pleaſant are the Charms of Love,

which like Streams are alwaies flowing,

So my paſſion s ſtill a growing,

nothing but my Celia's eyes can move,

So my paſſion's ſtill a growing,

perfect and immortall as the joyes above.

When Celia did my heart ſurprize,

every Siniew felt a pleaſure,

Each kind look from her oblieging ere

fill'd my heart with endleſs Treaſure:

Love, O Love, is the only treaſure,

Ioy and Bleſſing from the Brave and Wiſe,

Give me Love, one Life, and Pleaſure,

Shall never end what the World enjoys.

Ah! how raviſhing is the delight

how tranſporting is the pleaſure,

And what are the Charms that do invite

when each ſmile's a boundleſs treaſure,

That exceeds the Indian Ocean,

or all the Riches that the World can give,

Her eyes ſparkle in the motion

like the Heav'nly ſires that do ſorever live.

Oh ſtill in the Groves I ſing her praiſe

whilſt the Birds the ſame returning,

Loudly warble forth fair Celias lays,

and the Lark ſings every morning,

Grateful Tunes of ſweeteſt number,

for to raiſe my Celia from her eaſe,

So to ſhake off her ſoft ſlumber,

and all the gentle fancies that to her ſeize.

Ah how like the Snow are Celia's Breaſts

which do charm with pleaſant panting,

There the god of love his head does reſt,

nor can ſleep thoſe pillows wanting,

Whilſt her breath the Air perfuming.

Balm forth from her Coral Lips does flow

Which like Spices when they'r blooming,

round about the world fragrant ſweets do throw

Her fair Treſſes like Sun-beams do ſhine

with which amorous Winds ſtill playing,

Make her for to look far more divine,

whilſt devotion I am paying

And to pleaſures am aſpiring

as there's nothing more has power to move,

Nor on Earth that's worth deſiring,

is there ought I can compare with Celias love

Ah my Celia pride of all her Set,

beauty's boaſt and chiefeſt treaſure,

To whom Venus does all things anex,

to compleat her all of pleaſure,

That the joyes above reſembled,

in a mortal once again doth dwell,

Where all vertues are aſſembled

perfect in themſelves & that all elſe excell.

Which the world beſide has power to give,

Oh my Celia fair and charming,

By whoſe ſmiles alone I live

whoſe eyes like the Sun are warming,

But when in my Arms embracing

Oh then let my ſilence ſpeak the joy,

For 'tis far beyond expreſſing,

ſure ſuch bleſſed tranſports never yet could cloy.

All upon each pleaſant Tree her name

in cool ſhades I ſtill am carding,

That for evermore may live her Fame,

though far leſs than ſhe's deſerving,

Whileſt the Nymphs they do ſit ſinging,

and the pleaſant Roſes on her ſhed,

Endleſs joys are ever ſpringing,

& a thouſand bleſſings are around her ſpreed.

Each Shepherd does gaze with dazledeyes,

to ſee her face like Sun ariſing,

Caſt a bright Reflection on the Skies

or as a Comet that's ſurprizing

Cauſes wonder, as ſhe paſſes

all the Woods and Groves reſound her praſſe

Chaunted forth by Nymph-like Laſſes,

who for evermore unto her yield the Baye [...]

Then let Celia ever happy be,

Ay thrice happy in enjoying,

And to love for ever be ſhe free

to loves power there's no denying,

Then let no one envy this my Treaſure

in the which I ſtill content do find;

Endleſs joyes and endleſs pleaſure

which can never fade whilſt Celia proveth kind.
