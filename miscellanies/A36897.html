But at present <span class="hi">Cohabitation</span> is no ways proper; for I have such an Abhorrence of any thing that looks Unjust, tho' 'twere but in the least Trifle, that I think 'tis <span class="hi">a Great Sin</span> (if I am mistaken, I ask Pardon) <span class="hi">for any Man so much as to Try for an Heir that might probably Dispossess any one of a Iust Debt, tho' 'twere but of Two Farthings</span>—But being Ambitious to be a <span class="hi">Father,</span> if either my <span class="hi">Mother</span> or <span class="hi">Wife</span> will contribute to my being so upon <span class="hi">Honourable Terms,</span> I will believe and say as much of the Reality of their Kindness, as I now do to the contrary; and will esteem such a <span class="hi">Reconciliation</span> the happiest day I ever yet met withal. But if they will rather chuse to expose my Reputation <span class="hi">(which I have kept hitherto Vnblemish'd)</span> than to comply with those <span class="hi">Reasonable Terms</span> I have mention'd, it is evident their Hearts and their Tongues don't go to­gether: For the World knows well enough that my Mother has a FAIR ESTATE, and that my Wife is her only Child; and to whom upon our Marriage she promis'd to leave it; which Promise was made as a Motive <span class="hi">to make Me consent to the Match:</span> And since upon that Promise I marry'd her Daughter, and Joyntur'd her in a clear Estate of 2000 <span class="hi">l.</span> be­sides the <span class="hi">Reversions;</span> that she shou'd now suffer my Reputation to be slurr'd (as 'tis like to be) for want of 300 <span class="hi">l.</span> is what I believe your Self cou'd never have thought, had it not been told you.</p><p>But I know well enough they have their OBJE­CTIONS, with which they satisfie themselves, and I shoul'd not deal fairly by them (as I always have, and always will do) should I not inform you what they are.</p><p>They will say, <span class="hi">That if they shou'd do this, there will be no end of it; for I shall quickly run my self as far in Debt again by Printing (being what I so much delight in.)</span> But to obviate this, I answer, That I desire but 500 <span class="hi">l.</span> in all, of which I shall use 375 to clear the Bonds, and what I owe in Trade, and then there will be a <span class="hi">well-furnish'd House, a clear Stock, a good Estate in Land, and 125 l. in Money to Trade withal;</span> and that I may not be tempted to exceed those Bounds, I have resolved never to exceed 50 <span class="hi">l.</span> at once either in <span class="hi">Printers</span> or <span class="hi">Stationers</span> Debts. And if by Trading I shall happen to run that out, I will give over Trading, and live on what I have; which in Conjunction with my MO­THER's PROMISE,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note8">As I shall prove by the Letter that was sent to me by her Order.</span> is more by 6000 <span class="hi">l.</span> than ever we are likely to spend, having neither <span class="hi">Child nor Chick.</span></p><p>They may also object, <span class="hi">That tho' I have Ioyntur'd my Wife in my Estate, yet I still keep the Writings in my own hand, and will not let them have them.</span> To this I Answer, 'Tis true, I do so; but the Reason is, Because whilst I see they have no regard either to my <span class="hi">Ease</span> or <span class="hi">Reputation,</span> by enabling me to pay my just Debts, I cann't look upon 'em as my Friends, and upon that account have kept my <span class="hi">Writings</span> from 'em <span class="hi">[and they are now in the hands of an Eminent Citizen.]</span> But if they will Answer my Expectation, with respect to the Particulars above mention'd, I will, if my Mother desires it, put all my <span class="hi">Writings</span> into her hands, which at once takes off that <span class="hi">Objection.</span> Perhaps they'll also say,</p><p><span class="hi">That I have receiv'd Money from Ireland, for my Ven­ture thither, that might have paid my Debts with­out their help.</span> To this <span class="hi">I</span> Answer, The several Debts <span class="hi">I</span> contracted for <span class="hi">Paper</span> and <span class="hi">Printing</span> since my second Marriage—The Moneys which <span class="hi">I</span> paid that <span class="hi">I</span> took up upon Bond, to furnish out my Venture for <span class="hi">Ireland;</span> The Charges <span class="hi">I</span> was at in <span class="hi">Ireland,</span> for the King's Cu­stoms, Binders, Printers, five Servants, and the Sale, was about 440 <span class="hi">l.</span> The great quantity of Money <span class="hi">I</span> lost in <span class="hi">Ireland,</span> through the Dishonesty of some <span class="hi">I</span> trusted;

There is in­deed a way of doing Kindnesses that takes away the Kindness of the thing done; but when I see a <span class="hi">Kind­ness is done Kindly,</span> there's nothing can oblige me more—Nor will the Kindness be more to me than to my DEAR SPOUSE; for, <span class="hi">a Wife shines by her Husbands Honour, but must be darkened if he suffer an Ecclipse.</span>—If she believed this, she'd be forward to grant my Request; but whether she does or no, I look upon it an indispensible Duty to pay my Just Debts, and cann't die with a good Conscience till it be done; and wou'd no more have put my self out of a Capacity of doing it, than I wou'd have <span class="hi">Eaten Fire,</span> had I not thought I shou'd have had that Money from my Mother which would have inabled me to do it. And do you Judge whether I had not Reason to think so, for when her Attorney, whom I mentioned before, ask'd her before our Marriage <span class="hi">to lend me</span> 300 l. <span class="hi">she did not say she would not, which made him tell me, he did not doubt but she wou'd lend it.</span> I say, looking upon the Payment of my just Debts, as I do, to be an <span class="hi">Indispensible Duty,</span> if both my <span class="hi">Wife and Mother</span> refuse to assist me in it, I must Endea­vour to raise it from my <span class="hi">Estate</span> by Cutting down the Timber, there being <span class="hi">several Acres of Wood</span> upon it, which being sold, I doubt not will raise me a con­siderable Sum. 'Tis true, I am very loth to do this, because it will disgrace the Estate; but seeing they first expose my Reputation, why should I be solicitous about it? And I have no ways left to help my self, but either this, or else the <span class="hi">Selling the Rever­sion</span> of it after my Wives Life: And for my self, I am no ways solicitous; for, I'<span class="hi">d rather Beg, than not pay my Debts.</span></p><p>This, and our Living from each other, will be the unhappy Consequences of their Refusing to assist me: When on the contrary, shou'd they comply with my Desires, we might live happily together, and the Estate kept Free and Undisfigured. Besides, if Providence shou'd take me hence before her, I <span class="hi">shou'd think I cou'd not do better than to leave all to her, who was willing to part with all to serve me, and make me Easie.</span></p><p>But if they do not agree to these Terms, instead of <span class="hi">Marrying a Wife of a Fortune,</span> [as many a man has done, whose Estate is not worth so many Pence as mine is worth Hundreds] I have fairly married my own Ruine, and must have the <span class="hi">Scandal of Owing (I won't say Breaking for) 300 l.</span> tho my own Estate with the Reversions, is worth ten times more, be­sides her MOTHERS PROMISE of giving me <span class="hi">Sampsil,</span> (which is a Noble Estate it self) and the several hundreds she Dyed Possess'd of, which I am so far from desiring, that wou'd she but make me easie, there's not a Person in the World wou'd more hear­tily desire her Life than my self. But the <span class="hi">Whole Duty of Man</span> tells us, that <span class="hi">A Promise is a Debt,</span> and I thought I might depend upon it, (and therefore refus'd a Note she offer'd to secure <span class="hi">Sampsil</span> to me and my Wife, in Case she Marry'd her self) when made to influence <span class="hi">such a Solemn thing, as a Marriage.</span> Nei­ther do I doubt, at her Death, the Performance of the Marriage Promise, tho she shou'd think good, <span class="hi">to make me a Vagabond in the mean time.</span></p><p>But though at present I labour under the Mis­fortune of being forc'd to ask a Favour at their hands [I word it so, for were it in my Power, and I saw them so pinch'd as I am, I shou'd voluntarily pro­pose doing that which I am forc'd to intreat for, and perhaps in vain.] Yet my Comfort is, the <span class="hi">Printing of this Letter</span> will let the World (and my <span class="hi">Few Cre­ditors)</span> see that <span class="hi">I</span> wou'd be Honest, if my <span class="hi">Mother,</span> or <span class="hi">Wife</span> either, had so much Love for me as to let me; and therefore all the Injuries others suffer by <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1261"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=59887&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> me, will lie at their Doors; which will be a greater <span class="hi">Clog upon their Consciences than they'll be able to bear;</span> and therefore I hope they'll consider that <span class="hi">Covetousness</span> [especially in a <span class="hi">Husband</span> or <span class="hi">Wife]</span> is a more provoking Sin than is generally thought; for how often have SMITHFIELD-BARGAINS been made, to add Land to Land, not Love to Love; and to <span class="hi">unite Houses to Houses, not Hearts to Hearts; which hath been the Occasion that Men have turn'd Mon­sters, and Women Devils.</span></p><p>Thus have I fairly represented my <span class="hi">Whole Case,</span> with respect to my <span class="hi">Honoured Mother</span> and my <span class="hi">Dear Wife.</span> I shall not need to desire you to keep it <span class="hi">private,</span> having told it as a <span class="hi">Secret</span> [unless you shall think it proper to shew it to my <span class="hi">Wife</span> and <span class="hi">Mother]</span> for <span class="hi">I</span> would not it should be made <span class="hi">Publick</span> whilst there remains any hopes of an <span class="hi">Accommodation;</span> and therefore to que­stion your Faithfulness herein, wou'd look like a Re­flection upon you; or rather upon my self, in <span class="hi">com­municating a Secret of this Importance to one that I thought coudn't keep it.</span> But I have no such thoughts, only having been thus free with you, let me beg your Advice herein.—I cannot think but with <span class="hi">Extream Trouble,</span> of doing any thing that may Ex­pose <span class="hi">my Dear Wife and Mother,</span> whom [upon their <span class="hi">Compliance</span> with my Just Desires] I <span class="hi">cou'd Embrace in the Arms of a Sincere and Vnfeigned Affection, and bu­ry all that has hitherto look'd like Vnkindness, in the Grave of Eternal Oblivion.</span> But since Self-Preservation is the Great Fundamental Principle and Law of Na­ture, if they refuse to comply with me herein, and go about through their <span class="hi">inordinate Love of Money, to Banish me from my own Home, and Expose my Reputa­tion to the World;</span> I shall then be under a Necessity of Exposing them to the World in their <span class="hi">proper Co­lours,</span> being furnish'd [as I hinted before] with Ma­terials for that Purpose, but they shall never be Publish'd, if I can but meet with that Compliance from my Wife, which both the <span class="hi">Law of God and Man has made her Duty.</span></p><p><span class="hi">These things,</span> I think to lay before my <span class="hi">Wife and her Mother,</span> but wou'd willingly have your Thoughts about it first, which I shall very much depend up­on, as being one whom I always found my Faithful Friend: Pray be not long in sending me your <span class="hi">Best Advice,</span> for at present my Mind is very much dis­order'd, and the Disorder of my Mind, has <span class="hi">'twice this Summer,</span> like to have prov'd fatal to my Body.
