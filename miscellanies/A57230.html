The last thing I viewed of yours were your <span class="hi">An­notations</span> upon <span class="hi">GENESIS,</span> having before perused your other <span class="hi">Explanations</span> and <span class="hi">Observations</span> upon the Old Testa­ment, though sleight and suddenly done, as you say, yet think them not unworthy of the Presse.

And the inscri­bing of whose name, will bring lustre and credit to the Work it self, however otherways but too weak and unworthy. To speak much in this kinde of your selfe to your selfe, suits not so well, with that hu­mility and modesty which befitteth us both. And in so doing I should but light a candle before the Sunne. Yet you will give me leave to enjoy, and make this expression of mine own comforts, which I have still derived from all those endearments, wherewith you have vouchsafed to oblige and honour me, even from our young­er years, in our joynt Educations and first Employments, until now that we both are ready to leave the stage of this life.

Now albeit when your Lordship left them with me, you were pleased to af­ford me a longer space of time for the perusal of them, which I was willing to accept, not knowing what leisure I should have for them in regard of some present distractions; yet I could not forbear to lay hold on all opportunities, to enjoy the view of them; which I much thirsted after: which upon serious survey I found to be answerable to my pre-conceived expe­ctation of them, and well-worthy their Authour, containing in them many remarkable matters, either not commonly taken notice of, or mistaken by the most. In the Computation of times, your Lordship well knoweth, and much better then my self, that there are divers difficult points much disputed and debated among the grand Masters of that part of learning, in which being not so exactly versed in such Accounts, I dare not take upon me to determine ought. I have drawn up here a short note of some things of no great moment, which meeting with, I stick at, or have doubt of, that it may appear to your Lordship, that I have not slighted or laid it by me, but have advisedly run it over: which having dispatched, I was the rather willing to return it to your Lordship by the hands of my sonne <span class="hi">Tayler,</span> who was willing to take thereby occasion to wait upon your Lordship, to present you with a sorry fruit of my fruitlesse labours, which I shall intreat your Lordship to accept, and to look on with a favourable eye. This short list of my work and undigested thoughts, your Lordship may be pleased, if you shall think good, and deem them worthy of his consideration, to impart unto the Venerable Bishop, with recommendation of my due respects, and sincere affection to him, whom I should be right glad to be better acquainted withal, together with my humble request to him, that he will par­don my boldnesse, and bear with my weaknesse, which in these scriblings I doubt I have too much discovered. So with sincere acknowledgement of your Lordships manifold favours, and my deep engagements; in lieu whereof I have nothing of worth to return, but thanks to you, and prayers unto the Lord in whose work you labour, for his gracious and powerful support of you therein, I take leave, craving liberty to subscribe my self</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your Lordships weak and unworthy, but sincere well-wisher, much obliged in him, THO.

Afterwards perusing them, I found some differences between <span class="hi">those Annotations,</span> and <span class="hi">these Observations;</span> which did minister some occasion of enlarging my first draught; chiefly by noting and insisting upon these differences: yet rarely naming the said <span class="hi">Annotations;</span> but leaving rather the full animadverting, comparing and judging of them, to the judici­ous Reader. Thereafter I committed these to the Presse. And after a good progress had been made by it, for <span class="hi">some reasons,</span> not so fit to trouble thee withal, I was again indu­ced, and over-ruled, to enlarge my self yet much more; and to descend to very many Particulars, by way of Exposition and Explanation in some of the ensuing Books of Scripture, much beyond what was my first Proposal and Intendment. Which thing, I conceive, will dim the light and lustre of those choice places and <span class="hi">Observations,</span> which primarily were my only aime. Yet, I hope, to the Candid Reader, These larger additi­ons will not seem altogether impertinent, or improfitable; as to the speedier under­standing of Gods Holy Word. Neverthelesse I never undertook or intended to meddle with, or mention all the difficult places of Sacred Scripture. For them, in general, I refer thee to the said Great <span class="hi">Annotations,</span> as the best extant in that kinde. Neither do I here touch upon the <span class="hi">New Testament,</span> save only when, and where, the Text or the Old Testament doth crave for the quotation of it. In this Collection of <span class="hi">Observations</span> and <span class="hi">Explanations,</span> I follow the Order of the Books and Chapters of the Bible. And I heartily wish, that the holy Text were alwayes before their eyes, who shall vouchsafe to read them; without which the life of them, or of many of them will be lost. And the numerous quotations therein used will really appear, specially to Divines, to be of good concernment to them, and who shall have occasion to use them, and will take the paines to turne unto them. Be pleased not to think that I am too curious, or thy self can be too ambitious, of knowing any truth revealed in the Scri­ptures. Thou canst not search them too much, nor can the Word of God dwell too richly and plentifully in thee. Indeed the substantial and essential matters therein, must first be known and cared for. Yet these may help to bring divers remarkable Places and Passages of Scripture into more common knowledge, and familiar notion, then I suppose yet they are. Such as they are, yet now at the last, though the Presse much retarded them, if they may any wayes make for thy spiritual use and profit, that same is the earnest desire of</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Thy Servant in Christ J.

And the rather considering the Hebrew Articles here used, ETH, and HA, as pointing to these now in being. And yet as probably and more, of the common Chaos, and Masse, and Stock of both, as seeming to be included within the work of the first day: and so it will seem to have the best coherence, with the words next following, and the story ensuing of the Creation of the Heavens and Earth, the second and third day.</p><p><span class="hi">light day</span>] Strictly and usually so taken; otherwise called an Artificiall day, consisting of about twelve houres, <span class="hi">John</span> 119 As the natural day consists of 24. houres.

And here observe, that as Darknesse was before Light, <span class="hi">v</span> 2, 3. so the Even­ing and Night is made, and reckoned the beginning, and first part of the natural day, or large day of 24. houres. And accordingly the large Day is called an Evening Morning, <span class="hi">Dan.</span> 8. 14, 26. And by <span class="hi">Paul,</span> <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, a Night-Day, 2 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 11. 25. And as <span class="hi">Moses</span> doth here, so God commanded it, and the <span class="hi">Jewes</span> observed it, to reckon the beginning of their large Day at the Evening, <span class="hi">Lev. 23. 32. From evening to evening you shall celebrate your Sabbath.</span> And so for eating unleavened bread at the Passeover. <span class="hi">Exod. 12 18, In the first moneth, on the fourteenth day of the moneth at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread untill the twenty one day of the moneth at even.</span> And ye we finde in the dayes of our Saviour, the reckoning altered, that they began their natural and large Day in the Morning, as appeares in the Evangelists, re­cording the History of our Saviours Resurrection, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 28. 1. <span class="hi">Mar.</span> 16. 1, 2, 9. &amp; <span class="hi">ch. 15. 42. Luke 24. 1 Joh.</span> 20. 1, 19. Which alteration might haply be occasioned by the accompt of the <span class="hi">Romans,</span> and complyance with them, who then had the sovereignty and dominion over them.</p><p>Now these two things well observed, may haply serve to assoyle a doubt, and clear a difficulty. The case is this; Our Saviour did eat the Passeover twenty foure houres be­fore the <span class="hi">Jewes</span> did eat it. And this is clear out of the Go­spels, <span class="hi">Matth. 26. 17, 18, 19, 20, 47. Mark</span> 15. 42. <span class="hi">Luke 23. 54. Joh</span> 18. 28. and 9. 14, 31, 42. That our Saviour did not anticipate the day by reason of his future Passion; But kept the right day appointed in the Law, we are not to doubt of it; Considering the strictnesse of the Command for the day, <span class="hi">Exod.</span> 13. 10. And Christs com­ing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1044"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> to fulfil all righteousnesse, to keep the Law both Moral and Levitical. And that he did so in this point and parti­cular, appears also, <span class="hi">Matth. 26. 17. Marke</span> 14. 12. Neither do those words in <span class="hi">Joh.</span> 13. 1, 2. disagree from it; The words there mentioned, before the feast of the Passeover, ap­pearing to be understood of two dayes before the Passeover, <span class="hi">Mat</span> 26. 2. And being spoken on the Mount of Olives, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 24. 3. And the Supper there mentioned, being to be under­stood of the Supper in the night of the Passeover, which was kept in <span class="hi">Jerusalem, Mat.</span> 26. 17. And those loavs of bread in the Gospel, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 16. 9, 10. could make and multiply the wa­ters of the Deluge, to rise to such an height; and that as little by miracle, as the other way must needs imply.</p><p>Now the right day was the fourteenth day of the first moneth, <span class="hi">Abib,</span> or <span class="hi">Nisan,</span> in the evening, or betweene the two evenings, <span class="hi">Exod. 12. 6. i. e.</span> betweene the two extremi­ties of the evening-tide, whereof the former belonged to the end of the declining day the ending, which was the thirteenth day, (not the fourteenth, as in the late learned and large <span class="hi">Annotations</span> on <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 26. 17) the latter be­longed to the beginning of the night, when the day follow­ing is said to begin, <span class="hi">Gen.</span> 1. 5. which was the fourteenth day, at the beginning and evening whereof the Passeover was to be eaten, as appears, <span class="hi">verse</span> 18.</p><p>Now how it came to passe, that the Jews kept the wrong day, and why so, is the question and difficulty remaining. Some speak of a Jewish Tradition; That after the returne from the Babylenian captivity, They ordered and altered the time so, as the day of eating the Passeover might not fall on the Munday, Wednesday, or Friday; but then they put it off to the day following. The truth of this Tradition I am ignorant of: much more, of any reason why they should dare to have such a Tradition and Order. But finding in the Gospels, The Accompt for the Beginning of the natural &amp; large day of twenty four hours altered from the Evening to the Morning, as was formerly observed; I rather conceive that both our Saviour, and the Jewes may be said to eat the Passeover on the same day, <span class="hi">viz.</span> both on the Friday, and at the evening too; so it be understood according to their own several mindes and meanings, reckonings and ac­countings: Our Saviour rightly beginning and ending the day, from evening to evening, and the Jews erroneously, from morning to morning. The issue so, wil be this; That on the thirteenth day, consisting of twelve hours, from morn­ing to evening, called an artificial day, the Disciples prepa­red the Passeover for our Saviour; which is therefore cal­led the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 26. 17, 18, 19. And when the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ven was come, which was the true Beginning of the fourteenth day, Jesus sate down with the twelve to eate the Passeover, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 26. 20. according to the Law; The Morning after, and so on till the Even­ing, making an artificial day, which indeed was the true la­ter part of the fourteenth natural day, our Saviour was ex­amined, condemned, and at last suffered. And that time is called the Jewes Preparation, <span class="hi">Luke 23. 54. John</span> 19 31, 42. the Preparation of their Passeover, <span class="hi">John</span> 19. 14. the Prepa­ration before the Sabbath, <span class="hi">Marke</span> 15. 42. And the Even­ing following, which was the later part of their fourteenth day in their account, they did eat their Passeover. And the day following, which was the Sabbath, is called the day af­ter the Preparation, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> 27. 62. And whereas, to coun­tenance that pretended Jewish Tradition, for putting off the eating of the Paschal Lamb from the Friday, to the Sa­turday, which was their Sabbath-day, those words of <span class="hi">John</span> are alledged, <span class="hi">for that Sabbath was an high day,</span> John 19. 31. I answer, That it is called an <span class="hi">high day,</span> because it was the Sabbath that fell within the compasse of that high and so­lemne Feast. But all this I propound and submit to the judgement of the learned.</p><p>And again, This Observation of the true Beginning of the day at the Evening; Together with the Alteration of it from the Evening to the Morning in the dayes of our Sa­viour, may help to quiet that controversie which of late, hath troubled too many, about the Beginning and Ending of the Christian Sabbath, or Lords day rather. For, if we will begin it as the Jewes began their Sabbath, by Gods own appointment; and as the Beginning of the natural day of twenty four hours was reckoned from the Creation, Then sure we must begin it at the Evening. But if we will begin it, according to that alledged Alteration we finde in our Sa­viours time, Then we must Begin it in the Morning, which later is favoured the more by our Saviours Resurrection ve­ry early in the morning, <span class="hi">Matth. 28. 1, 6. Marke</span> 16. 2, 6. <span class="hi">Luke 24. 1, 6. John</span> 20. 1. To the memory and honour of whose Resurrection as the day of Rest was changed, so it accords well, and suitably seems to require the same change for the beginning of that day; agreeing therin with the afore­said Alteration. However, the Point Material is, That it must comprehend twenty four hours.</p><p>V. 6. <span class="hi">Firmament</span>] By Firmament here generaly by all is understood whatsoever is to be seene in that vast space a­bove the earth, from the surface of it, to the uppermost vi­sible Orbs: As conceiving, and that justly, That the Aire, or lowest region of it, betwixt the Earth and the Clouds, were alone too smal a thing for the whole work of the second day. In the midst of the waters, <span class="hi">and let it divide the wa­ters from the waters: the waters which are under the firma­ment, from the waters which are above the firmament;</span>] Di­vers ancient and learned Fathers have conceived hereupon, and upon the words of the <span class="hi">Psalme</span> 148. 4. That a great, or the greatest part of those waters that covered the face of the <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, <span class="hi">verse</span> 2. were lifted up and spread as an Orbe of wa­ters above, and about the highest part of the starry heavens, and so there remaine. And from those windowes of heaven opened some would fetch the greatest part of those waters in the Deluge, that covered all the high hills that were un­der the whole heaven fifteene cubits upwards. Yet all this seemes too weak a foundation whereon to build that Orbe of supercelestial waters. For plaine it is, that the lowest re­gion of the aire is called heaven, and the firmament of hea­ven, even that wherein the winds, clouds, and fowles do flie, <span class="hi">verse 20. Jer. 51. 16. Dan.</span> 7. 2, 13. And indeed as e­very part of the water is truly called water, so every part of the heaven, and firmament may be, and is called heaven, as well as the whole, or the highest parts of it the starry hea­ven, and the third heaven, <span class="hi">chap 1. verse 14, 15, 16, 17. Gen.</span> 22. 17. 2. <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 12. 2. And if such a division were meant, as they pretend to, where then would be the division betweene the waters of the seas, and the watery clouds; without which division, and the use of it, the earth could not bring forth sustenance for Man, or Beast? And as for the windowes of heaven, they are understood of the region of the aire, as <span class="hi">Psal. 78. 23. Mal.</span> 3. 10.

Thence twenty nine dayes reacheth to the first moneth, first day, when the ground was dry.

Now with the blood, or in the blood, the flesh was not to be eaten; but first it must be killed and cleansed of the blood. A restraint, no doubt, to make them the more fearful of shedding mans blood, as the words following do declare. But yet thus the sense of the place seemes not so full, as when the blood is forbidden, not on­ly with the flesh in the veines, (for who desires so to eat it) but also poured out by it self alone. And thus the prohibition was given by <span class="hi">Moses</span> to the Jewes, who decla­red at large the various manner of the use of blood, in their several kindes of sacrifices; but inhibits the eating of it, rather then, or at any other time. In their sacri­ces, sometimes some of it was sprinkled upon the side of the Altar, and the rest of the blood wrung out at the bot­tome of the Altar; as when turtle-Doves or Pigeons were sacrificed, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 1. 15. and 5. 9. sometimes it was sprinkled round about upon the Altar; as in the burnt-offerings, and peace-offerings, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 1. 5, 11. and, <span class="hi">chap.</span> 3. 2, 8, 13. sometimes with the finger dipped in it, some of it was put upon the hornes of the Altar, and the rest poured out at the bottome of the Altar; as in the sin-offer­ing for the Ruler, and for any one of the common peo­ple, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 4. 25, 30, 34. sometimes with the finger dip­ped in it. some of it was to be sprinkled seven times before the Lord, before the vaile of the Sanctuary. And then some of it to be put upon the hornes of the Altar of sweet incense before the Lord, and the rest of the blood to be poured out at the bottome of the Altar of the burnt-offer­ing; as in the sin-offering of the Holy Priest, <span class="hi">Levit</span> 4. <span class="hi">v.</span> 5, 6, 7. And of the whole Congregation, <span class="hi">ch. 4. v.</span> 16, 17, 18. Sometimes it was to be put upon the tip of the right eare, and upon the thumb of the right hand, and up­on the great toe of the right foot; and some of the blood upon the Altar was to be sprinkled upon the garments, as <span class="hi">Moses</span> did at the consecration of <span class="hi">Aaron</span> and his sonnes, <span class="hi">Levit.</span> 8. 23, 24, 30. all which was typical and ceremo­nial. In summe, it was given upon the Altar, to make an atonement for soules; for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soule, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 17. 11. and almost all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 9. 22. But with them blood was never at any time, or upon any occasion to be eaten, <span class="hi">Lev. 7. 26, 27. 1 Sam.</span> 14. 32, 33, 34.

And if they had been passed over so, the Chronology of the world had beed lost. But now here they are resumed, and the chaine of Chronology carefully continued.

The yeares of the world, in the former ten to the six hundredth yeare of <span class="hi">Noah,</span> when the flood came, amounted to the number of 1656. The years from the flood, which was in the nine­ty eighth yeare of <span class="hi">Shems</span> age, to the birth of <span class="hi">A­bram</span> the tenth Patriarch after the flood, came but to the number of three hundred fifty two yeares: For mans age was shortened about the half at the time of the flood. And again shortened about the half in <span class="hi">Pelegs</span> time, at the building of <span class="hi">Babel.</span> And yet the third time shortened somewhat near the half in the time of <span class="hi">Nahor,</span> as may be seen and observed in the ages of the Patriarchs at their deaths in this chapter.</p><p><span class="hi">Arphaxad</span>] The third son of <span class="hi">Shem, 1 Chron.</span> 1. 17.</p><p>V. 12. <span class="hi">Arphaxad begat Salah</span>] Betwixt these is inserted <span class="hi">Cainan,</span> as the sonne of <span class="hi">Arphaxad,</span> and father of <span class="hi">Salah; Luke</span> 3. 35, 36. which would break the chaine of Chro­nology, and leave unknown the age of the world.

All these are expressely threatened with, and sen­tenced to this punishment. And the meaning of the phrase is most usually taken to signifie a cutting off by death, and it is so expressed, <span class="hi">Exod. 31. 14. Lev</span> 17. 4 20. 2, 3, 4. 5. And must needs be so understood when it is used against grievous sins and crimes, as against idolatry, witchcraft, incest, and sins done presumptuously, despising the Word of the Lord, and reproaching him. This penalty is to be inflicted by the Magistrates power no doubt: And in case of his faile, God himself threatens and undertakes to do it, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 17. 10, 20. 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. 23. 30. And for the lesser offences mentioned, they being wittingly and wilfully done in Gods Worship and service, and against his plaine and peremptory command; I see not how they come short of sins of presumption, <span class="hi">Numb.</span> 15. 30. which are doomed to death in the judgement of the learned upon that place. I conceive therefore that they fall short, that by this pe­nalty here, will understand no more, but that such an offender is to be cast off, and held for no Jew, but as an Heathen man. And they also that would apply this phrase here, and in other places of the Old Testament, for the maintenance of Ecclesiastical Excommunication among the Jewes. The doubtfulnesse of the meaning of the phrase hath made me the more inquisitive into it, I con­fesse, if not too tedious in it. However I leave all to bet­ter judgements. And for my part like not in things dubi­ous to be too definitive.</p><p>V. 15. <span class="hi">Sarah</span>] Yet in the New Testament it is written <span class="hi">Sara,</span> without the [<span class="hi">h</span>] the Greek tongue having no [<span class="hi">h</span>] at the end of words.</p><p>V. 16. <span class="hi">Nations</span>] 1 <span class="hi">Pet. 3. 6.

XXV.</span></h3><p>Ver. 1. <span class="hi">THen again</span>] Whether in <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> life-time cannot certainly be determined. The sa­cred story mentions nothing of <span class="hi">Keturab</span> or her children, till now after <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> death. And the words here seem to give it to be after her death. And <span class="hi">Sarah</span> in her life-time not enduring <span class="hi">Hagar</span> and <span class="hi">Ishmael▪</span> would hardly have en­dured another. And <span class="hi">Isaac</span> when offered is called his on­ly son. And yet on the other side, <span class="hi">Keturab</span> is called a Con­cubine, implicitely, <span class="hi">v.</span> 6. and expresly, 1 <span class="hi">Chron.</span> 1. 32 And though a Coucubine be called a wife, yet I finde not that a legitimate wife, as she should be after <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> death, or a second wife, is called a Concubine. And the words of <span class="hi">Abrahams</span> servant seeking a wife for <span class="hi">Isaac, ch.</span> 24. 36. compa­red with <span class="hi">v.</span> 5, 6. of this chapter, seem to reflect on <span class="hi">Ketu­rahs</span> sonnes in <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> life-time. And which is most of all, if <span class="hi">Abraham</span> did not take her to wife till after <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> death, then he must be one hundred thirty eight, and likely one hundred and fourty yeares old when he married her, and after that begat six sonnes of her, whereas the Apostle saith, that fourty yeares before that time, his body was dead for begetting of children, <span class="hi">Rom. 4. 19. Gen.</span> 17. 17. 18. 12. If then it were after <span class="hi">Sarahs</span> death, it must be said, that God did renew unto him that masculine strength, and vigour of body, after fourty yeares, by an extraordinary blessing, in a marvellous, if not miraculous manner, and that to make good his Promise of multiply­ing <span class="hi">Abrahams</span> seed, <span class="hi">ch.</span> 17. 5. in others also, though princi­pally in <span class="hi">Isaac.</span></p><p>V. 2. <span class="hi">Medan] Ch.</span> 37. 36.</p><p>Midian] Numb. 25. 6, 17.</p><p>Shuah] Job 2. 11.</p><p><span class="hi">V.</span> 3.

A Vow is a binding of the soule with a bond, by a sacred, and solemne, a free and voluntary Promise made to God, for the doing or more careful doing of things, which o­therwise by our duty and Gods Law we are bound to do, or for the doing of certain things lawful in themselves, but otherwise left indifferent to be done, or not to be done; or for the abstaining from the use of some things, other­wise lawful to be used. And all this in way of thankfulness to God for some extraordinary blessings received; or for the obtaining of some special benefits, which we greatly desire and stand in need of. And therefore Vowes are ever joyned with Prayers, or Praises and Thanksgiving, or both. And these Vowes once made must carefully be kept and performed. Thus <span class="hi">Jocob</span> here vowed by way of thank­fulnesse to God for this glorious Apparition, and the gra­cious Promises vouchsafed to him, and for further and fu­ture blessings to be received from God, that God should be his God, this should be a new engagement and obligation upon him, that he would for ever serve and worship him; and that that stone or pillar now erected by him, should be Gods house, a place consecrated to his worship and service, and that he would give the tenth of all he should have to God, and for his special use in Sacrifices, Altars, sacred buildings, and maintenance of his service. Thus <span class="hi">Hannah</span> vowed, that if God would deliver her from the reproach of barrennesse, and give her a man-child, she would give him to the Lord all the dayes of his life, and no razour should come upon his head, 1 <span class="hi">Sam</span> 1. 11. Thus <span class="hi">Bathsheba</span> it seems made a Vow for the obtaining of <span class="hi">Solomon,</span> whence she cal­leth him the sonne of her Vowes, <span class="hi">Prov.</span> 31. 2. Thus <span class="hi">Jeph­thah</span> made a Vow to obtain victory against the children of <span class="hi">Ammon, Judg</span> 11. 30, 39. And all <span class="hi">Israel,</span> to obtain victo­ry against King <span class="hi">Arad</span> the Canaanite and his people, <span class="hi">Numb.</span> 21. 1, 2. Thus <span class="hi">David</span> vowed unto the mighty God of <span class="hi">Ja­cob,</span> forthwith to finde out a place for the habitation of the Lord, <span class="hi">Psal.</span> 132. 2, 3. Thus <span class="hi">Paul</span> was under a Vow, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 18. 18. And again he and foure other men, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 21, 23, 24. Yea, the Heathen Mariners, by the light of nature made vows to the Lord, vowes of thankfulnesse for their deliverance from shipwrack, <span class="hi">Jonah</span> 1. 16. In <span class="hi">Moses</span> time, the vow of a Nazarite and Lawes for them are set down at large, <span class="hi">Numb.</span> 6. as also the things to be vowed to the Lord, as per­sons, beasts, clean and unclean, houses, fields of inheritance, and of purchase, whether vowed before the year of Jubile, or after, and the several Lawes for the Redemption of them, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 27. And in that Mosaical and Ceremonial Law, God carefully provides that no unworthy thing shall be vowed to him, no beast deformed, or that hath any member superfluous, or lacking, or any way faulty, <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 22. 18, 21, 22, 23. <span class="hi">Mal.</span> 1. 14. Much lesse the hire of a whore, or price of a dog, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> 23. 18. any sinful thing as those wicked men of <span class="hi">Judah</span> did, in their idolatrous ways, both they and their wives which fled into the land of <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> contrary to the Word of the Lord by <span class="hi">Jeremie</span> say, We will <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13944"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=26">[Page]</a></span> surely perform our vowes which we have vowed, to burne incense to the Queen of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings unto her, <span class="hi">Jer.</span> 44. 25. And least of all would he have any sinful vow made unto him. Now to forbear to vow is no sin, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> 23. 22. at least, no such sin as if they vow and pay not, as, <span class="hi">John</span> 9. 41. If ye were blinde, ye should have no sin, no such sin as now remaineth on you, for refusing the light. And the like, <span class="hi">John</span> 15. 22, 24. For howsoever in the general, a vow is a kinde of a free-will-offering, a service of God, <span class="hi">Esay</span> 19. 21. but an arbitrary and voluntary service. Before men vow it is in their own power and pleasure, as it is spoken in <span class="hi">Ananias</span> his case, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 5. 4. yet in some extraordinary cases of petition and thanksgiving, vowes are requisite and necessary. And however; yet being once made lawfully, after vowes to make enquiry, undoubtedly it is sin. But after vowes to make enquiry is a snare and sin, <span class="hi">Prov.</span> 20. 25. For who vowes, bindes his soule with a bond, <span class="hi">Numb.</span> 30. 3. And there­fore when a lawful vow is lawfully made, then God strictly requires the same to be punctually performed, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> 23. 21, 23. <span class="hi">Eccl.</span> 5. 4, 5, 6. And for that cause he gives Laws, who have power to vow, and who may not vow, namely, children and wives, who are not free of themselves, but un­der the power and command of others, <span class="hi">Numb.</span> 30. <span class="hi">David</span> therefore is mindful of his performance, <span class="hi">Thy vowes are upon me, O God, Psal</span> 56. 12. and 66. 13, 14.

One is, that <span class="hi">Jacob</span> married first at the end of his first seven years service. And then having <span class="hi">Leah</span> fraudulently put upon him in stead of <span class="hi">Rachel.</span> That he newly con­tracts the second time to have <span class="hi">Rachel</span> for other seven years service; but marries her a week after he had taken <span class="hi">Leah;</span> and performes that seven yeares service, for <span class="hi">Rachel</span> after he had married her. And most Expositors are of this opi­nion. But I conceive there are two strong arguments a­gainst it. One is, that they are thereby forced to hold, that <span class="hi">Jacobs</span> twelve children were all borne within those seven yeares, <span class="hi">viz. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Ashur, Issachar, Zebulun, Dinah, Joseph, v.</span> 25. <span class="hi">ch.</span> 31. 38, 41. You may say, this may well enough, be by foure women, I confesse it; but considering the plaine and pregnant passages of the sacred history, in the times and manner of their births, I hold it impossible. For it is plaine, that none of them at any time had twins. Again, <span class="hi">Leah</span> had <span class="hi">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,</span> at several births, which will take up three or foure of the seven yeares, before <span class="hi">Rachel</span> complaines of barrennesse. Or put case she complained sooner then the history mentions, yet <span class="hi">Bilhah</span> must have <span class="hi">Dan</span> and <span class="hi">Naphtali</span> at several births, before <span class="hi">Zilpah</span> had <span class="hi">Gad</span> and <span class="hi">Ashvr</span> at several births; and these last foure sonnes will take up three or foure yeares; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14365"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=27">[Page]</a></span> and after all this, <span class="hi">Leah</span> having formerly left bearing when <span class="hi">Judah</span> was borne, <span class="hi">v.</span> 35. <span class="hi">ch</span> 30. 9. And when <span class="hi">Reuben</span> her eldest sonne was of age to finde mandrakes in the field; then after her time of barrennesse, and after her maid <span class="hi">Zil­pahs</span> births, she then again conceiving beares <span class="hi">Issachar,</span> and <span class="hi">Zebulun,</span> and <span class="hi">Dinah</span> at several births. And last of all <span class="hi">Ra­chel</span> beares <span class="hi">Joseth,</span> all which must be done within the com­passe of one seven years according to that opinion. Which, how it may stand with truth, and without offering vi­olence to the course of the history, and to many words of the text, I confesse I cannot comprehend. And a second argument against that opinion, is taken from the conside­ration of <span class="hi">Judahs</span> age, and the birth of <span class="hi">Hezron</span> and <span class="hi">Hamul</span> his Grandchildren, when they with <span class="hi">Jacob</span> and all his posterity went down into <span class="hi">Egypt</span> ch. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.] To, open this we must first knew, that <span class="hi">Jacob</span> was seventy five yeares old when he came down to <span class="hi">Laban,</span> which appeares thus; he was one hun­dred and thirty years old when he stood before <span class="hi">Pharaoh, ch</span> 47. 9. and then <span class="hi">Joseph</span> was fourty years old, <span class="hi">viz.</span> thirty when he was taken out of pri<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>on and advanced by <span class="hi">Phara­oh, ch.</span> 41. 46. After which passed seven years of plenty, and three of famine when <span class="hi">Jacob</span> came down, <span class="hi">Joseph</span> then being fourty yeares old; it appeares also that he was borne in the fourteenth yeare after <span class="hi">Jacobs</span> coming to <span class="hi">Laban, ch</span> 30. 25. 31. 38, 41. Take then those fourteen yeares be­fore <span class="hi">Joseph</span> was borne, and the fourty yeares of <span class="hi">Josephs</span> age, when his father stood before <span class="hi">Pharaoh,</span> out of his fathers age at that time, he being then one hundred and thirty; and it will so be clear, that <span class="hi">Jacob</span> was seventy five or seventy six yeares old, when he first came to <span class="hi">Laban.</span> Now this being so, <span class="hi">Judah</span> the fourth sonne of <span class="hi">Jacob</span> by <span class="hi">Leah,</span> must needs be by their opinion but three or foure yeares elder then <span class="hi">Jo­seph, Jacob</span> not <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Leah,</span> as they say, till after his first seven yeares of service were ended. And so <span class="hi">Judah</span> must be but fourty three or fourty foure yeares old at most, when he and his Grandchildren <span class="hi">Hezron</span> and <span class="hi">Hamul</span> came with <span class="hi">Jacob</span> into <span class="hi">Egypt.</span> To compasse this, they must cast their reckonings thus, that <span class="hi">Judah</span> married at twelve yeares old, and had <span class="hi">Er</span> at thirteen; that <span class="hi">Er</span> married at twelve yeares old, and <span class="hi">Onan</span> his younger brother, <span class="hi">ch.</span> 38. 4. marri­ed at twelve yeares old, that <span class="hi">Tamar</span> remained a widow, and waited till <span class="hi">Sh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>lah</span> was grown; and the dayes being multi­plied, <span class="hi">Judahs</span> wife died, and <span class="hi">Tamar</span> beares to <span class="hi">Judah Pharez;</span> and all this within the compasse of three years. That <span class="hi">Pha­rez</span> married at twelve yeares old and begat <span class="hi">Hezron</span> and <span class="hi">Ha­mul;</span> and supposing them to be twirs, that at a yeare old they were carried into <span class="hi">Egypt.</span> For thus the reckoning will rise to the fourty third or fourty fourth yeare of <span class="hi">Judahs</span> age. But these supposed reckonings seem so harsh in that age of the world, to the most learned favourers of this o­pinion, that they choose to ease or avoid this, to say ra­ther, that <span class="hi">Hezron</span> and <span class="hi">Hamul</span> were not carried down into <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> but were borne afterwards in <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> so the learned late <span class="hi">Annot.</span> on <span class="hi">ch.</span> 46. 12. But this were to offer such plain violence to that text; and to the drift of that whole chapter, and giving way for others borne after in <span class="hi">Egypt</span> to be reck­oned in as well as they, for why not others as well as they? and so the whole number to be altered, and the intent of the Holy Ghost disappointed; that I think upon due consideration had, not many will comply with that conceit. And the same <span class="hi">Annotators</span> disclaim it them­selves, in their <span class="hi">Annotations</span> on <span class="hi">ch.</span> 38. 1. The other opi­nion whereunto my resolution bends, is this; that <span class="hi">Jacob</span> being seventy five yeares old, married both sisters at the beginning of the fourteen yeares service, fulfilling a week in keeping the feast at the marriage of the one, and so a­gain presently after at the marriage of the other. And the enjoying not the want and hopeful expectation of <span class="hi">Ra­chel,</span> made his seven years service for her seem unto him to be bu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> a few dayes. This addition of seven yeares to the former opinion gives faire way to the birth of all the twelve children, in that order and sequence of time, as the letter of the words, and context of the story do require, and gives further scope, (which yet is little enough) for the time of the birth of <span class="hi">Hezron</span> and <span class="hi">Hamul,</span> in the fiftieth year of <span class="hi">Judahs</span> age, (as this opinion makes it) when he and they went down with <span class="hi">Jacob</span> into <span class="hi">Egypt.</span> The only difficulty here occuring is, the exposition of some words and senten­ces, seeming to favour the first opinion, which yet may better receive a commodious interpretation, then involve and intangle us in greater perplexities, and draw upon us the fore-mentioned incongruities, if not impossibilities. The text then here saith, <span class="hi">That Jacob served seven yeares for Rahel</span>] that is, after he had married her. And so all Ex­positors agree, that indeed he did so, though most of them infer it upon their construction of the 27. and 28. verses.</p><p><span class="hi">but a few dayes</span>] If he had not enjoyed her by marriage all those seven yeares of his service, they would have seemed a longsome and tedious time.

Therest, and so the most of the story in this chapter, fell out after the selling of <span class="hi">Joseph</span> into <span class="hi">Egypt.</span></p><p><span class="hi">went dom<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> from his brethren</span>] Not before he left <span class="hi">Laban,</span> though some reject not that opinion; but before <span class="hi">Dinahs</span> ravishing, yea, speedily upon his first coming into <span class="hi">Canaan.</span> They that make <span class="hi">Judah</span> to be born in the beginning of the 14th year of the latter seven of <span class="hi">Jacobs</span> service, &amp; so but three or four years older then <span class="hi">Ioseph,</span> and but fourty three or fourty foure when he came with his father into <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> they find him by that account to be but ten yeares old when he first came into <span class="hi">Canaan,</span> and thereupon defer his marriage till two or three yeares after, and so straiten the times for the births of his off-spring before they all went into <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> which howsoever the great <span class="hi">Annotations</span> miscast it upon this place, must needs run thus, <span class="hi">viz.</span> that <span class="hi">Judah</span> at twelve or thirteen married the daughter of <span class="hi">Shuah,</span> two or three yeares after his coming into <span class="hi">Canaan;</span> and in three yeares after had <span class="hi">Er, Onan</span> and <span class="hi">Shelah.</span> That <span class="hi">Er</span> at twelve marri­ed <span class="hi">Tamar,</span> that foure yeares were spent in the matters of <span class="hi">Onan</span> and <span class="hi">Shelah,</span> and <span class="hi">Judahs</span> begetting <span class="hi">Pharez,</span> and <span class="hi">Zerah</span> of <span class="hi">Tamar,</span> to the time of the birth of <span class="hi">Pharez:</span> that <span class="hi">Pharez</span> at twelve married, and in two yeares had <span class="hi">Ezrom</span> and <span class="hi">Hamul.</span> All which do make up but thirty three or thirty four years, which is the ful time between the first coming of them all into <span class="hi">Canaan,</span> and their going down into <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> as clearly appears by the several periods of <span class="hi">Josephs</span> age; he being six or seven yeares old when they all left <span class="hi">Laban,</span> and fourty when they all came down unto him into <span class="hi">Egypt.</span> But the other opinion which makes <span class="hi">Judah</span> to be borne in the fourth yeare of the first seven of <span class="hi">Jacobs</span> service, and so to be ten yeares older then <span class="hi">Joseph,</span> and fifty yeares old when he with his father came into <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> doth give fairer way to the course and times of the story thus, <span class="hi">viz. Judah</span> at six­teen yeares old, comes into <span class="hi">Canaan,</span> and speedily marries the daughter of <span class="hi">Shuah.</span> In the next yeare hath <span class="hi">Er.

Gal. 2. 11, &amp;c.</span> and all the A­postles erred in the point of Christs Resurrection, and of his Kingdome, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 1. 6. and of the calling of the Gentiles. And St. <span class="hi">Luke</span> might do right in recording it as it came from <span class="hi">Stephen.</span> As the like is in <span class="hi">ch.</span> 27. 19, 24. and, 1 <span class="hi">Kings 13. 18. Josephs</span> bones were buried in <span class="hi">She­chem,</span> the place his father bequeathed to him and his on his death-bed, and likely the rest of his brethren, in con­formity to his example, would be buried there, have their bones likewise carried thither; and this, though not mentioned in Scripture, might by other Records or Re­velation be made known to <span class="hi">Stephen,</span> as the names of <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>annes</span> and <span class="hi">Jambres</span> to <span class="hi">Paul, 2 Tim.</span> 3. 8. the Prophecie of <span class="hi">Enoch</span> to <span class="hi">Jude, v.</span> 14. the Genealogy to <span class="hi">Luke, ch. 3. v.</span> 23, to 31. <span class="hi">Jacob</span> himself was certainly buried in <span class="hi">Machpelah,</span> as is here recorded: and though he be joyned together with his sonnes in a state of mortality, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 7. 15. yet the sixteenth verse of their burial may well be confi­ned to his sonnes as the next Antecedent without taking him into the number. And that <span class="hi">Jacob</span> bought the field of the sonnes of <span class="hi">Emor</span> or <span class="hi">Hamor, Shechems</span> father, is like­wise certain. By <span class="hi">Abraham</span> then, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 7. 16. we must un­derstand <span class="hi">Abrahams</span> Grand-Child <span class="hi">Jacob;</span> And so ex­pound it, which is a very harsh Exposition, the whole text considered, and could not be so apprehended by the multitude of his hearers. Or rather we may say, that <span class="hi">Stephen</span> mistook the story, and named <span class="hi">Abraham</span> in stead of <span class="hi">Jacob,</span> which may be done without any great offence, as hath been shewed, and so <span class="hi">Luke</span> relates what rightly he should; for to lay an errour upon the sacred text, by say­ing <span class="hi">Jacob</span> should be put in the text in stead of <span class="hi">Abraham,</span> and that <span class="hi">Abraham</span> came into it by the errour of the tran­scribers, mistaking the one name for the other, or whereas neither was in the Original, and <span class="hi">Abraham</span> errour be­ing put in the margin, that from the margin they put it into the text, all this is not so likely, nor any way so safe. That <span class="hi">Emor</span> or <span class="hi">Hamor</span> was father to <span class="hi">Sichem,</span> not sonne to <span class="hi">Sichem,</span> appears, <span class="hi">Josh. 24. 32. Gen.</span> 33. 19. and therefore it is so to be supplied in <span class="hi">Acts</span> 7. 16. so is the word mother supplied, <span class="hi">Luke</span> 24. 10. out of <span class="hi">Mar</span> 15. 40.

So justly reckoning <span class="hi">Jacob</span> himself, and <span class="hi">Joseph</span> with his two sons, who were then in <span class="hi">Egypt</span> already.

This truth appears thus; From the death of <span class="hi">Joseph,</span> to the birth of <span class="hi">Moses</span> were 60. years, and either 56. or 65. or 72. or 80. And this assertion of 60. years is thus gathered. The Israelites being in <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> from the going down of <span class="hi">Jacob</span> thither, till <span class="hi">Moses</span> brought them out thence, 210 years; as hath been shewed on <span class="hi">Gen.</span> XV. 13. And <span class="hi">Joseph</span> be­ing 40 years old when his father <span class="hi">Jacob</span> came down; as being 30 when <span class="hi">Pharaoh</span> advanced him, <span class="hi">Gen.</span> XLI. 46. And after that, seven years of Plenty passing, and the third year of Famine in being, when <span class="hi">Ja­cob</span> came down. And <span class="hi">Joseph</span> living 110 years, <span class="hi">Gen.</span> L. 22. So leaves 70 of his life to be spent in <span class="hi">Egypt,</span> after <span class="hi">Jacobs</span> coming down thither. And <span class="hi">Moses</span> being 80 years old when he brought the <span class="hi">Isra­elites</span> out of <span class="hi">Egypt, Exod.</span> VII. 7. So leaves just 60 years, between <span class="hi">Iosephs</span> death, and <span class="hi">Moses</span> his birth. For those three numbers, of <span class="hi">Io­sephs</span> 70. and the said interval of 60, and <span class="hi">Moses</span> his 80. make up the said summe of 210 years. Now to those 60 years before the Birth of <span class="hi">Moses,</span> adde those 80 years of his age, <span class="hi">Exod.</span> VII. 7.

And their making and erecting of the Taberna­cle, in the next year, first moneth, first day, <span class="hi">Exod.</span> XL. 1.

From whence, even after this Change, the year of Jubile, and Sabbath-year, and year for some Civil accompts did continue still to have and enjoy their former Beginnings; as we see, <span class="hi">Levit.</span> XXV. 8, 9, 10. <span class="hi">Exod.</span> XXIII. 11, 16. and <span class="hi">Ch.</span> XXXIV. 22.</p><p><span class="hi">In the evening</span>] The Paschal Lamb is appointed here to be kill'd and eaten,<span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">chapter </span>XII</span> <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>6</span> and so the Passeover to be kept, at <span class="hi">Even;</span> or, as it is in the Hebrew, at or between the two <span class="hi">Evenings;</span> And so, <span class="hi">Num.</span> IX. 3. <span class="hi">Lev.</span> XXIII. 5. And so kept by our Saviour at <span class="hi">Even, Matth.</span> XXVI. 20. Now the better to know the <span class="hi">Even,</span> and two <span class="hi">Evenings,</span> we must first know, That the Artificial Day is divided, from Sunne-rising to Sun-setting, into twelve hours, <span class="hi">John</span> XI. 9. <span class="hi">Matth.</span> XX. 6, 12. <span class="hi">Acts</span> II. 15. which hours are sometimes longer, sometimes shorter, as the course of the Sunne measures them. And again, that day seemes to have a division into three equal parts, allotting four hours to each part. Or into four equal parts, allotting three hours to each part. And so the first part is from their Sunne-rising, to our ninth hour: the second from our ninth to our twelfth, or Noone, and Mid-day: the third from that, to our three in the after-noone: the fourth from that, to Sun-setting. And sometimes there is taken in­to the first of these, the time from Day-light to Sun-rising: And in­to the last of these, the time from Sun-setting to night and darknesse, as <span class="hi">Matth.</span> XVI. 2. and XXVII. 57. <span class="hi">John</span> XX. 19. And both these comprise the whole dayes Fasting, 2 <span class="hi">Sam.</span> I. 12. Now the <span class="hi">Even</span> in Scripture is most properly, and usually expressed, and defined strict­ly by the Going down, or Setting of the Sunne. So in the purify­ing of the Unclean, <span class="hi">Levit.</span> XXII. 6, 7. <span class="hi">Deut.</span> XXIII. 11. And so in that case of the King of <span class="hi">Ai, Iosh.</span> VIII. 29. And of <span class="hi">Ahab, 2 Chron. XVIII.</span> 34. And of those five Kings in the Cave of <span class="hi">Makkedah, Iosh.</span> X. 26, 27. And so in <span class="hi">Mark</span> I. 32. And so it is expressely for the Passeover it self, <span class="hi">Deut.</span> XVI. 6. To which acceptation of the <span class="hi">Even</span> agrees that, <span class="hi">Psal.</span> CIV. 23. <span class="hi">Mark XI. 11, 19. Luke XXIV. 29. Acts IV.</span> 3. and <span class="hi">XXVIII.</span> 23. Yet in Scripture the Evening is sometimes taken in a larger extent and latitude, for the latter part of the Day, beginning from the declining of the Sunne at Mid-day; or from the abating of the heat and force of it, at our three in the after-noone: As may be clearly gathered from <span class="hi">Mat. XIV. v.</span> 15,—23. <span class="hi">Mark VI.</span> 35, 47. <span class="hi">Luke IX.</span> 12. And as it is usual taken with us in our ordinary sa­lutations. Now at, or between the two Evenings, is mentioned, as for the yearly Passeover; so for the daily Evening Sacrifice, <span class="hi">Exod. XXIX. 39. Num. XXVIII.</span> 4. And for the daily burning of <span class="hi">Incense</span> on the <span class="hi">Incense</span>-Altar: And for the daily dressing and lighting of the <span class="hi">Lamps</span> in the Tabernacle, <span class="hi">Exod.</span> XXX. 8. So that in these four cases the meaning of the phrase seemes to be the same; Noting out one certain time; and these two Evenings in the larger, or stricter sig­nification, to be contiguous, or continued rather; to be that <span class="hi">Communis terminus,</span> which couples the end of the day, and the beginning of the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e29777"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=46">[Page 13]</a></span> night together; or the two extremities of our Evening-tide, where­of the former belongs to the end and shutting up of the natural day preceding, and the later to the beginning of the night, which leades on, and ushers in the natural or civil day following, as the first part of it. So that this time is a participle of both, or a Borderer betwixt both, as the large Annotations fitly expresse it.</p><p><span class="hi">Two side-posts</span>] In this first Passeover each Head of a family served as a <span class="hi">Priest:</span> <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>7</span> divers <span class="hi">Rites</span> were enjoyned, which were not observed or required afterwards; And the second moneth also allowed for it, <span class="hi">Num.

But why so called, or what their Office was, whether as Publike Notaries, Scriveners, or Transcribers of the Law, or what else, it appears not. Here in <span class="hi">Iosiah's</span> time we finde that in his businesse of repairing the house of the Lord, there were appointed of the Levites Scribes. And in <span class="hi">Nehemiah's</span> time he made Treasurers over the <span class="hi">Treasuries</span> [in the Lords House] <span class="hi">Shelemiah</span> the Priest, and <span class="hi">Zadok</span> the Scribe.

In the New Testament we finde them much more mentioned; and to be of more esteeme; and themselves affected Preheminence and precedencies, <span class="hi">Mark. XII.</span> 38, 39. Here they are often joyned with the Chief Priests, and Elders, and often with the Pharisees. They pretended to extraordinary holinesse, as the Pharisees did; whence is that, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> V. 20. and <span class="hi">Acts</span> XXIII. 9. They were of the Pharisees part against the Sadduces. Yea he that is called a Scribe, <span class="hi">Marke</span> XII. 28. the same is called a Pharisee, and a Lawyer, <span class="hi">Matth. XXII.</span> 34, 35. We read not that they were of the Sect of the Sadduces, or Essenes. But we finde them to joyne with all the rest, to question, to pose, and oppose our Saviour, to entangle and insnare him by Questions, to charge his miracles to be done by <span class="hi">Belzebub;</span> Himself, with Blasphemy; to apprehend and binde him; to condemne him in the Councel; to deliver him to <span class="hi">Pilate;</span> to accuse him before <span class="hi">Herod;</span> to prosecute him to death; to mock him upon the Crosse.

Some make it about fifty five; reckoning so from the twentieth of <span class="hi">Artaxerxes Mnemon,</span> to the period of the Persian Empire.</p><p>The two maine and differing reckonings then of the years of the two Books of <span class="hi">Ezra,</span> and <span class="hi">Nehemie</span> joyntly considered, stand thus; Reckoning as some do, to <span class="hi">Ezra</span> one hundred fourty six, and to <span class="hi">Nehemie</span> fifty five, the summe of both comes to two hundred and one. But rather reckoning to <span class="hi">Ezra</span> seventy two, and to <span class="hi">Nehemie</span> one hun­dred and twenty, the summe of both doth arise to one hundred ninety two. Thus the difference between these two reckonings of both Books joyntly, amounteth to nine years.</p><p>If this <span class="hi">Nehemiah</span> be the same that came up with <span class="hi">Zerubbabel</span> and <span class="hi">Je­shua,</span> mentioned <span class="hi">Ezra II. 2.

XII.</span> 10, 11. mentioning <span class="hi">Jaddua</span> the High Priest, must needs be inserted by some other Prophet since his dayes; And much more since the dayes of <span class="hi">Ezra:</span> For <span class="hi">Jaddua</span> lived till the dayes of <span class="hi">Alexander</span> the Great, and met him coming into <span class="hi">Jerusalem:</span> which is the very last Historical Passage and Record of the Old Testament: For <span class="hi">Psalm XLIV.</span> And <span class="hi">LXXIV.</span> concei­ved by some to be penned in the dayes of <span class="hi">Antiochus Epiphanes,</span> carrie no sure ground for such an after-date. And surely so many years as include the whole continuance of the Persian Empire and more, do far passe the date of one mans life in that age of the world. Yet that <span class="hi">Nehe­miah</span> might well reach to the 32. year of <span class="hi">Artaxerxes Longimanus;</span> which is the last passage of this Book, setting that of <span class="hi">Jaddua</span> aside.

He will speak to God and say, wherfore doest thou so contend with me; and search after my sinne?

He propounds to <span class="hi">Job,</span> and dilates upon Gods Wisdome, Power, Justice, Mercie; the good he aimes at in sending afflictions, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 5,—15. He ap­plieth this last point to <span class="hi">Job.</span> telling him what might have been, if he had carried himself well in this affliction, <span class="hi">ver</span> 16. What is on him, be­cause he did not, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 17. What will be, if he repent not, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 18,—21. He adviseth him to remember himself, what God is, in himself, and in his wayes, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 22, 23. And in his works; in the Meteors of the aire, the raine, the clouds, the lightnings, whereby he can work good to his, and hurt to his enemies; And whereby <span class="hi">Job</span> should be moved to mag­nifie him, and his infinite wisdome, rather then to stand on his own in­nocencie, and quarrel so much at his rigorous dealing with him, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 22,—33.</p><p><span class="hi">At this also] Elihu</span> proceeds on to speak of Gods works of Light­ning and Thunder; <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">chapter </span>XXXVII</span> <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>1</span> haply the cracks of it then sounding, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 1—5.

And that <span class="hi">Job</span> should weigh, and wonder at all this, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 1,—14. These natural things farre surpasse the knowledge of man: and much more Gods strange and various pro­ceedings with the sonnes of men: And therefore <span class="hi">Iob</span> must not so cen­sure God, though he be in such misery. And <span class="hi">Elihu</span> further pursueth this same point; with the use, and application of it, to the end of his speech, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 15,—24.</p><p><span class="hi">Then the Lord</span>] Here Jehovah himself,<span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">chapter </span>XXXVIII</span> <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>1</span> out of a Whirle-winde be­gins to answer <span class="hi">Iob.</span> And this continues in two majestical speeches; far beyond those of <span class="hi">Elihu</span> for matter, and maner. And herein by his ma­nifold, and marvelous works <span class="hi">chap.</span> XXXVIII. and XXXIX. And par­ticularly by his creatures, <span class="hi">Behemoth, chap.</span> XL. and <span class="hi">Leviathan, chap.</span> XLI. he convinceth <span class="hi">Iob</span> of ignorance, and of impotencie; and there­fore that he should not take upon him to contend with God; to con­demne God, that himself might be righteous. To each of which speeches there is adjoyned <span class="hi">Iobs</span> humble and penitent submission. And lastly the Lord prefers <span class="hi">Iob,</span> and his Cause, before his three friends; Or­ders their Submission, and Sacrifice, and <span class="hi">Iobs</span> Prayer for them; Accepts <span class="hi">Iob,</span> and blesseth him, giving him as many sonnes and daughters, and twice as much in all particulars of his substance and wealth, as he had before, <span class="hi">chap.</span> XLII.</p><p><span class="hi">answer thou me.] Iob</span> had desired this more then once: And <span class="hi">Zophar</span> too, <span class="hi">chap.</span> XI. 5.<span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>3</span> <span class="hi">Iob</span> had been right in the maine; yet some rash, if not raging speeches, had escaped from him; complaining of God, and his justice, if not injustice, in his dealing with him.

The second part, with <span class="hi">Psal.</span> LXXII. The third, with <span class="hi">Psalme</span> LXXXIX. The fourth, with <span class="hi">Psalm</span> CVI. The fifth, with <span class="hi">Psalme</span> CL.</p><p>The Division of them, from the Subject-matters of them, is very various. There are <span class="hi">Psalmes Laudatorie,</span> of Praises; <span class="hi">Gratulatorie,</span> of Thanksgiving: <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> of Supplications; of Deprecations; of Con­solations; of Comminations; of Imprecations: There are Peneten­tial <span class="hi">Psalmes; Psalmes</span> to teach; to give instruction; <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> to bring to Remembrance, things past; <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> Prophetical, of things to come: And many <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> are mixt of many, or most of these matters. So as out of them, as out of a store-house, every man may richly fit and fur­nish himself for all and every particular occasion, either publike, or else private, according to his several conditions, in prosperity, or ad­versity, in all his devotions, and addresses to God; still finding his own estate in some one <span class="hi">Psalme</span> or other; These <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> containing the ve­ry Anatomy of the soul, the characters and representations of the thoughts, meditations, affections, and workings of it, towards God, towards man, towards herself, throughout all the changes of her pil­grimage in this world.</p><p>The number of them is one hundred and fifty. The LXX. and vulgar Latin, do divide the ninth <span class="hi">Psalme</span> into two. And so their rec­koning of the number doth constantly go on to exceed ours by one, un­to the CXLVII. <span class="hi">Psalm:</span> which <span class="hi">Psalm</span> doth contain their CXLVI. and CXLVII. And so in the conclusion all agree in the same number of CL.</p><p>Of these, eighty two bear <span class="hi">Davids</span> title.

The rest be­ing XXV. the sixth part of the whole number, are without any Title or Inscription at all.</p><p>In the Titles we have the persons, by whom they were written; or for whom they were written; or to whom they were committed.

In some their Matter Subject, as of Prayer, of Deprecation, as Destroy not; of obtestation; of Gratulation or Thanksgiving; of Praise; of Instru­ction, and Doctrine; of Commemoration, or for Remembrance; of nuptial love.</p><p>The Musick, either by voice, or instrument mentioned in some Ti­tles, is but little known in our dayes; yet for the voice, some <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> may seeme to point to the Base, some to the Tenor, some to the Coun­ter-tenor: And again, in some mens opinions, some <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> do inti­mate that the voice should leade, and the instrument follow; as in those Titles <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>: Some, that the instruments should leade, and the voice follow; as in those Titles <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> But the truth is, That howsoever <span class="hi">Selah</span> in the Text, used some seventy times in this Book, and three times in that prayer of <span class="hi">Habakkuk, chap.</span> III. sometimes in the middle of a verse, but mostwhat in the end; may seeme to be a Musi­cal Note; And <span class="hi">Neginoth</span> to be an hand or stringed instrument; <span class="hi">Shoshan­nim,</span> of six strings; from <span class="hi">Shesh,</span> six, as <span class="hi">Shalishim</span> of three strings, 1, <span class="hi">Sam.</span> XVIII. 6. <span class="hi">Sheminith,</span> of eight strings; <span class="hi">Nehiloth,</span> a wind-instrument; <span class="hi">Ma­halath,</span> likewise.

And sometimes they cite not the entire Text, nor tie them­selves to the precise words of the place, nor observe strictly the Or­der of them, as they lie in the Text; but pick only out of them so much as may serve for their present purpose; which in quotation of places is sufficient.

The scope of the Apostles in citing this place is not to deale about the deliverance of Christs soul out of Hell, but punctualy of Christs Resurrection: They inferre nothing else out of this Text. But Resurrection is properly of the Body, not of the Soul. <span class="hi">Gehenna</span> is sometimes taken for the Grave; and most-times further, for Hell it self. The true meaning and sense of the Article of Christs Descent into Hell, as the Latines very improperly translate the words, <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, seemes to be thus rendered rather, he went into the place of invisible souls: and to be understood of Christs Soul; for his body remained in the Grave; And his soul in that interim to passe to the place of souls; to Heaven or Paradise; as the souls of the godly did, and his principaly. As the souls of the wicked went to Hell. For <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> as a general name doth cer­tainly and evidently signifie both places. And thus the Articles go on methodicaly, without any tautologie; That after Christs death, his body was buried in the Grave, his Soul went to the place of blessed souls; and the third day, both soul and body were reunited in his Re­surrection.

Not that the hyposta­tical union of both natures was then or ever severed or dissolved. But yet he suffered chiefly in his soul, all the paines, pangs and agonies of a justly angry and punishing God, even more then can either be ex­pressed or imagined, even so farre above the measure of ordinary suf­ferings, as himself was above ordinary men; without any influence, or joy, or comfort streaming from the Vision of God upon his mind and wil for that time. So that he suffered as in body, so in soul, in his whole man; as in his sensual part, so in his intellectual also, in his whole soul, and body, and in all the parts, powers, and faculties of them. And the greatest sufferings, as was said, that could be sustained in this life, <span class="hi">Lam.</span> I. 12. yet without any derogation to the integrity, purity, innocencie, dignity of the person of Christ our Surety and Saviour. These words then are not a complaint out of impatience, ignorance, disobedience, or diffidence. They are the words of sense, not of infidelity.

He strongly calls him <span class="hi">his God,</span> even in that instant of these suffering; so expressing his firme faith in him. But they are a Protestation of the bitternesse of his Passion, so stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted, and so farre prevailing on him, in whom the spi­rit of fortitude had his residence.</p><p><span class="hi">forsaken me</span>] This sense of dereliction and carencie of Divine fa­vour for the time, as it was the Fathers pleasure to have it so, so the Sonnes office called him unto it; and he did not contract it by any fault of his, but did voluntarily undertake it for our sinnes, and the ex­piation of them: as he did the death it self. So that in this then there could not be any defect or defanlt of faith, and hope requisite in him, And likewise that Prayer and Speech, <span class="hi">Matth.</span> XXVI. 39. bewrayes the sense of the flesh; but joyned with the obedience of the Spirit in him: A double Will in him, against Monothelites: but joyned both in one holy obedience and subjection. All which shew the na­ture of sinne, the infinite wrath of God against it; the infinite Love of the Father, and the Sonne, towards the children of men; and the ve­rity of Christs Humane Nature, both in body and soul.</p><p><span class="hi">roaring</span>] Like that of Lions <span class="hi">Psal.</span> XXXII. 3. and XXXVIII. 8. <span class="hi">Matth.</span> XXVI. 38. <span class="hi">Marke</span> XIV. 33. <span class="hi">Luke</span> XXII. 44. so that he had need of an Angel for his Comforter.

Heathens have much debated this matter. <span class="hi">Job</span> is much upon it, as <span class="hi">chap.</span> XXI. 7. &amp;c. and <span class="hi">chap.</span> XXIV: and <span class="hi">chap.</span> XXVII. and in other places. Divers other <span class="hi">Psalmes</span> also insist upon it more or lesse; as <span class="hi">Psal.</span> XLIX. and LXXIII. and XC. <span class="hi">Jeremie</span> professedly, <span class="hi">chap.</span> XII. 1. <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> And <span class="hi">Habakkuk</span> some­what, <span class="hi">chap.</span> I. 13. The case in point of fact is plain and undeniable. The Providence, Wisdome, and Justice of God in it, is a Mystery to man. Yet to the Christian who believes the Resurrection of the bo­dy, and eternal life, things not so clearly revealed in the infancie of the Church, the difficulty is now soone dissolved. And the well and wise weighing of the point by an Heathen, or natural man, may much availe him for his further and better information in matters of great consequence and concernment. See the <span class="hi">Annotations</span> on <span class="hi">Psal.</span> XLI. 1. The greatest doubt arising hence to the godly, may seeme to be this, How these same occurrences of administrations in Gods Providence may stand with such constant, continual, and abundant promises of Gods blessings in temporal things to the godly in this life, 1 <span class="hi">Tim.</span> IV. 8. and with his like threatnings of plagues and punishments to the wicked in this world. The issue will be, That these Promises and Threatnings, specialy under the Law, are spoken to vulgar capacities, in those times; and yet have their exceptions and limitations in the Word: And that the prosperity of the wicked is but a seeming prospe­rity; and a short, and momentany prosperity in relation to eternity; and many wayes disadvantageous and hurtful to them; and ends with an overthrow suddaine, and terrible, and everlasting: And again, That the affliction of the godly is but momentany, nothing to eternity, and mainly profitable for the work of Grace here, more then abundantly recompensing and over-poizing their afflictions; and for the increase of Glory hereafter.

Christ is said in Scripture promiscuously, both to <span class="hi">stand,</span> and to <span class="hi">sit</span> at the right hand of God, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> I. 3. <span class="hi">Acts</span> VII. 55, 56. 1 <span class="hi">Pet.</span> III. 22.</p><p><span class="hi">at my right hand</span>] The right hand signifies <span class="hi">power and strength, Psal.</span> CXVIII. 16. <span class="hi">Exod.</span> XV. 6. <span class="hi">Psal.</span> CXLIV. 8. <span class="hi">Power to help, verse 5. Psal.</span> XVI. 8. and CXLII. 4. <span class="hi">Eccles.</span> X. 2. <span class="hi">To be or sit there,</span> imports <span class="hi">dignity and honour, 1 Kings</span> II. 19. <span class="hi">Matth.</span> XX. 21. And such is the meaning here. And this <span class="hi">dignity</span> here expressed by this phrase is ascribed to Christ; not in relation to his <span class="hi">Deity,</span> for so he and the Father are one. Herein he is, and alwayes was of equal dignity with the Father: But in regard of his <span class="hi">Humanity</span> whereby the Father was greater then he: And wherein formerly he had emptied and hum­bled himself, and suffered, even to death; and so was made a little lower then the Angels. But now hereby he is crowned with glory and honour. Yet this dignity here is not ascribed to his Humanity singly in it self considered, but <span class="hi">in supposito,</span> as it hypostaticaly subsists in the Person of the Sonne of God. And this Dignity is not an elevation and exaltation of the Humanity of our Saviour into the Majesty and essential properties and prerogatives of the Divine-nature; and so to have a parity of Dignity with it, an equality in all points; realy com­municated to the Humanity in it self, as the Ubiquitaries contend and plead for, and which they referre, not to the Person only; but to the very Humane nature also in the Person of the Sonne of God. But this Dignity of Christs Humanity is that which is next in degree un­der God and the Father, above that of the Angels, and all creatures, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> I. 3, 4. <span class="hi">Ephes.</span> I. 20, 21, 22, 23. given to him in time, after his Ascention, as a consequent and reward of his exinanition and passion, <span class="hi">Phil.</span> II. <span class="hi">ult. Heb.</span> II. 9. <span class="hi">Luke</span> XXIV. 26. This Dignity Saint <span class="hi">Paul</span> de­clares, 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> XV. 25. and Saint <span class="hi">Peter, Acts</span> V. 31. and X. 42. <span class="hi">Iohn</span> V. 27. In summe then, as Christ emptied himself, and subjected him­self to the Father, not in regard of his Divine nature, but in regard of his Person God-man, and that only out of his Voluntary dispensati­on; So out of the same his voluntary dispensation it is, that he exer­cises this office of Mediation in both natures, And here after his As­cention; not before; in the Personal Union of both Natures; he re­ceives this Dignity of sitting on the Fathers right hand; his Person reigning so in both natures. It is not then the Humanity in it self sing­ly taken that sits on the right hand of God; but the Humanity of that Person that sits at the right hand of God: as in the Incarnation it came to passe, not that the Humanity became God, but that the Hu­manity <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e88190"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=159">[Page 252]</a></span> became then the Humanity of God. And Christ now sitting at the right hand of God doth reigne every where▪ even as Man also; though his Humanity be not every where: as a King doth in his King­dom, though his body be not every where▪ as the Head in the Body, though the Head be not every where as the Sun in the firmament en­lightens, heats, cherisheth, quickeneth things below, though the Sun remaine in its own place above.</p><p><span class="hi">until</span>] 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> XV. 14, 25, 28. Not yet that the Son shal then leave off all Rule and Reigne, and be subject to the Father simply: But that then he shall leave off his Office of Mediation, having then overcome his enemies, and fully gathered his Church; he shall not thenceforth use those meanes, and actings which formerly he did; the whole work being then finished; then shall he leave off the administration of that delegation which he had formerly freely undertaken, there being then no more need of it. But thenceforth shall he reigne together with the Father to all eternity; <span class="hi">Dan.</span> VII. 14. <span class="hi">Luke</span> I. 23.

The Apostle further observeth his Offices, that he was both King and Priest; and that our Saviour was made such, with an oath of God the Father; and a Priest of a better Priesthood, Covenant, and Commandment; and that he was made, not after the Law of a carnal commandement, having carnal succes­sors in his Priesthood; but after the power of an endlesse life, conse­crated for evermore, having an eternal Priesthood, and unchangeable, continuing ever, and living ever to make intercession, and by his one, offering up himself once for all, saving them to the uttermost that come to God by him.

His eyes are in the ends of the earth; his heart at his left hand; he will be medling: he enters into contention, and his mouth calleth for stroaks, <span class="hi">Job</span> V. 2. A stone is heavie, and the sand weighty, yet his wrath is heavi­er then them both. And as a whip is for the horse, a bridle for the Asse, so a rod for the fools back: yet he trusts in his own heart: that though thou shouldest bray him in a Morter among wheat with a pestle, <span class="hi">yet will not his foolishnesse depart from him: But as a dog returneth to his vo­mit, so a fool to his folly. He hath no delight in understanding; it is too high for him: though a price be put in his hand,</span> to get wisdome, yet he hath no heart; he doth despise, doth hate knowledge and reproof: yea the thought of foolishnesse is sinne. <span class="hi">He makes a mock of sinne; it is a sport to him to do mischief:</span> And therefore saith <span class="hi">Solomon, meddle not with him,</span> or his companie.

His maine businesse is a curious search after true Felicitie and real Contentation. And upon his search, and experience he doth finde and pronounce. That in order thereun­to, all things under the Sunne were but vanitie of vanities, and vexa­tion of spirit: and for such experimented by him; though the same improved by humane wisdome in him to the utmost, <span class="hi">Chap.</span> II. 3, 9. This he shews in a large maner, in sundry sorts, in many particular va­nities under the Sunne; principaly in humane wisdome and know­ledge, humane labours, industries, and endeavours; in Delights and Pleasures of all kinds; in Honours, Greatnesse, and Power; in Rich­es and Possessions; and in the utter insufficiencie that is in all these, to extract from them, or the quintessence of them, any true happi­nesse, or from any other sublunarie thing, or creature whatsoever. He seemes to speak sometimes in the person, and according to the carnal reasonings of the Atheist and Epicure, as reciting their opinions, with their arguments; yet he avers the truth of God against them; and the just and wise course, though to us secret, hid, and unsearchable, of his Providence, Administration, and government of all the events, issues, accidents, and affairs of this life, in relation both to the just, and to sinners; even in things befalling in common to both of them. He giveth sundry sound remedies to abate and heale the said Vanities. He speaks much for Wisdome, and against Folly. And prescribes many good Rules for better things, for procuring tranquillity unto the mind, and peace and comfort to the life of a man; eftsoones minding and mentioning, among other things, a chearful fruition and enjoyment of the outward Blessings and Comforts of this Life, with gladnesse, contentation, and thankfulnesse, as from the hand of God. And last­ly, in the twelfth <span class="hi">Chapter</span> he concludes, That in Old age, elegantly de­scribed by him, and at Death, It will appear, That to Fear God, and Keep his Commandments, is the whole of man, both the whole Du­tie, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e102661"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=49194&amp;page=184">[Page 309]</a></span> and Felicitie of Man; the one, and only thing wherein it consist­eth.</p><p><span class="hi">The words] Solomons</span> Ethicks,<span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">verse </span>1</span> his Sapiential Tractate of the <span class="hi">Sove­reign good;</span> <span class="milestone"><span class="milestoneunit">chapter </span>I</span> his Retractations and Penitential Sermon; his Experi­ments.</p><p><span class="hi">of the Preacher</span>] Or of a preaching soul.

Yea, God justly suffering and presenting such objects, and occasioning such things to fall out, as are not simply evil in themselves, yet through their default will prove stumbling-blocks unto them, as whereupon their own wicked hearts will still work and improve their own induration, excecation, and ir­ritation to further sinning. Thus they willingly fall further into sin­full actions. The power of doing which acts, as they are acts, are yet from God alone, in whom we live, and move, and have our being; but the obliquity, malignity, and evil of them is from the wicked Agent. And all this God doth in a way of justice: It is a just thing with God, when men wilfully winkand shut their eyes against the light; And when they harden their hearts, and stop their eares against him, his Word, and Will, and Works; It is just with him, in maner aforesaid, to let them have and enjoy what they so love and desire to have and enjoy.
