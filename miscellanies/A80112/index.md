### 1.1. Advice to a Painter, by A. M. Eſq

Spread a large Canvaſs, Painter, to contain

The great Aſſembly, and the num'rous Train,

Where all about him ſhall in Triumph ſit

Abhorring Wiſdom and deſpiſing Wit,

Hating all Juſtice and reſolv'd to Fight.

Firſt draw His Highneſs proſtrate to the South,

Adoring Rome, with this Speech in his Mouth.

Moſt Holy Father, being joyn'd in League

With Father P—s, D—y, and with Teague,

Thrown at your Sacred Feet, I humbly bow,

I and the wiſe Aſſociates of my Vow;

A Vow, nor Fire nor Sword ſhall ever end,

Till all this Nation to your Footſtool bend:

Thus arm'd with Zeal and Bleſſings from your Hands,

I'le raiſe my Papiſts, and my Iriſh Bands;

And by a Noble well-contrived Plot,

Manag'd by wiſe Fitz—and by Scot,

Prove to the World, I'le have Old England know,

That common Senſe is my Eternal Foe.

I ne'r can fight in a more glorious Cauſe,

Than to deſtroy their Liberty and Laws,

Their Houſe of Commons, and their Houſe of Lords,

Parliaments, Precedents and dull Records;

Shall theſe e'r dare to contradict my Will,

And think a Prince oth' Blood can e'r do Ill?

It is our Birth-right to have Power to kill.

Shall they e're dare to think they ſhall decide

The Way to Heaven, and who ſhall be my Guide?

Shall they pretend to ſay, That Bread is Bread,

Or there's no Purgatory for the Dead?

That Extream Unction is but common Oyl,

And not Infallibly the Roman Spoil?

I will have Villains in our Notions reſt,

And I do ſay it, therefore it's the beſt.

Next Painter draw his M—by his ſide,

Conveying his Religion and his Bride;

He who long ſince abjur'd the Royal Line,

Does now in Popery with his Maſter joyn.

[[Page 4]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=4)

Then draw the Princeſs with her golden Locks,

Haſtning to be envenom'd with the P—

And in her youthful Veins receive a Wound,

Which ſent N. H. before her, under Ground;

The Wound of which the tainted Ch—fades,

Laid up in Store for a new Set of Maids.

Poor Princeſs, born under a ſullen Star,

To find ſuch Welcome when you came ſo far!

Better ſome jealous Neighbour of your own

Had call'd you to a Sound, tho' petty Throne,

Where 'twixt a wholeſom Husband and a Page,

You might have linger'd out a lazy Age,

Than on dull Hopes of being here a Q—

E're twenty dye, and rot before fifteen.

Now Painter ſhew us in the Blackeſt Dye,

The Counſellors of all this Villany:

Cl—d, who firſt appear'd in humble guiſe,

Was always thought too Gentle, Meek and Wiſe:

But when he came to act upon the Stage,

He prov'd the mad Cethegus of our Age;

He and his D—ke had both too great a Mind,

To be by Juſtice or by Law confin'd;

Their boyling Heads can hear no other Sounds

Than Fleets and Armies, Battails, Blood and Woun'ds;

And to deſtroy our Liberty they hope,

By Iriſh Talbot, and old doting Pope.

Next Talbot muſt by his great Maſter ſtand,

Laden with Folly, Fleſh, and Ill-got Land;

He's of a ſize indeed to fill a Porch,

But ne're can make a Pillar of the Church;

His Sword is all his Argument, not his Book,

Alt ho no Scholar, he can act the Cook;

And will cut Throats again, if he be paid;

In th' Iriſh Shambles he firſt learn'd the Trade.

Then Painter ſhew thy Skill, and in fit place,

Let's ſee the Nuncio A—ll's ſweet Face.

Let the Beholders by thy Art eſpy

His Senſe and Soul, as ſquinting as his Eye.

Let B—s autumnal Face be ſeen,

Rich with the Spoils of a poor Algerine,

Who truſting in him, was by him betray'd;

And ſo ſhall we when his Advice's obey'd:

Great Heroes to get Honour by the Sword,

He got his Wealth by breaking of his Word;

And now his Daughter he hath got with Child,

And Pimps to have his Family defil'd,

[[Page 5]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=4)

Next Painter draw the Rabble of the Plot,

G—n, Fitz G—d, Loftus, Porter, Scot:

Theſe are fit Heads indeed, to turn a State,

And change the Order of a Nations Fate;

Ten thouſand ſuch as theſe ſhall ne'r controul

The ſmalleſt Atom of an Engliſh Soul.

Old England on a ſtrong Foundation ſtands,

Defying all their Heads and all their Hands,

Its ſteady Baſis never could be ſhook,

When Wiſer Men her Ruin undertook:

And can her Guardian Angels let her ſtoop

At laſt, to Madmen, Fools, and to the Pope?

No Painter, no cloſe up this Piece and See,

This crowd of Traitors hang'd in EFFIGIE.

### 1.2. Hodge, a Countryman, went up to the Piramid, His VISION.

WHen Hodge had numbred up, how many Score

The airy Piramid contain'd, he ſwore,

No mortal Wight e'r climb'd ſo high before.

To th' beſt Advantage plac'd, he Views around,

Th' Imperial Throne with lofty Turrets crown'd,

The wealthy Store-houſe of the bounteous Flood,

Whoſe paceful Tide o're-flows our Land with Good:

Confuſed Forms fleet by his wondring Eyes,

And his Soul too, ſeiz'd by Divine ſurprize.

Some God it ſeems had entred his plain Breaſt,

And with's Abode that Ruſtick Manſion bleſt.

A mighty Change he feels in ev'ry part;

Light guides his Eyes, and Wiſdom rules his Heart:

So when her pious Son, fair Venus ſhow'd

His flaming Troy, with ſlaughter'd Dardan's Strow'd,

She purg'd his Optick Films, his clouded Sight,

Then Troy's laſt Doom he read by Heaven's Light;

Such Light Divine did ſeize the dazling Eyes

Of humble Hodge.

Regions remote, Courts, Councils, Policies

The Circling Wills of Tyrants Treacheries

He views, diſcerns, deciphers, penetrates,

From Charle's Dukes, to Europe's armed States.

He ſaw the Goatiſh King in his Alcove,

With ſecret Scenes of his inceſtuous Love;

To whom he ſpoke:

[[Page 6]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=5)

Ceaſe, ceaſe, O Charles, thus to pollute our Iſle;

Return, return to thy long wiſht Exile;

There with thy Court deſile the neighb'ring States.

And by thy Crimes participate their Fates.

He ſaw the Duke in his curſt Divan ſet

To's vaſt Deſigns reaching his Pigmy-Wit,

With a choice Knot of the Ignatian Crew,

Who th' way to Murthers and to Treaſons ſhew:

Diſſenters they oppreſs with Laws ſevere

That whilſt we wound theſe innocents, we fear

Their curſed Seed we may be forc'd to ſpare.

Twice the Reform'd muſt fight a double Prize,

That Rome and France may in their Ruines riſe.

Old Bonner ſingle Hereticks did burn,

Theſe Reform'd Cities into Aſhes turn,

And ev'ry year new Fires make us mourn.

Hybernian Tories plot his cruel Reign,

And thirſt for Engliſh Martyrs Blood again.

Our Valiant Youth abroad muſt learn the Trade

Of unjuſt War, their Countrey to invade;

Others at home muſt grind us to prepare

Our Gallick Necks their Iron Yoke to wear.

Ships, once our Safety and our glorious Might,

Are doom'd with Worms and Rottenneſs to fight;

Whilſt France rides Sovereign o're the Britiſh Main,

Our Merchants robb'd, and brave Sea-men ſlain:

T' inſure his Plot, France muſt his Legions ſend,

Rome to reſtore, and to enthrone his Friend:

Thus the raſh Phaeton with Fury hurl'd,

And rapid Rage, conſumes the Britiſh World.

Blaſt him, O Heaven, in his mad Career,

And let theſe Iſles no more his Frenzy fear:

Curſt—whom all Mankind abhor;

Falſe to thy ſelf, but to thy Friend much more,

To him who did thy promis'd Pardon hope, (Coleman.

And with pretended Tranſports kiſs the Rope;

Ore-whelm'd with Grief, and gaſping out a Lie,

Deceiv'd, and unprepar'd, thou letſt him die

With equal Gratitude and Treachery.

### 1.3. BRITANNIA and RALEIGH.

By A. M.

Brit.

AH Raleigh, when thou didſt thy Breath reſign

To trembling James, would I had quitted mine.

Cubs did'ſt thou call them? Hadſt thou ſeen this Brood

Of Earls, Dukes, and Princes of the Blood;

No more of Scottiſh Race thou wouldſt complain

Theſe would be Bleſſings in this ſpurious Reign.

Awake, ariſe from thy long bleſt Repoſe;

Once more with me partake of Morlace Woes.

Ra.

What mighty Pow'r hath forc'd me from my reſt?

Oh mighty Queen, why ſo untimely dreſt?

Brit.

Favour'd by Night, conceal'd in this Diſguiſe,

Whilſt the lewd Court in drunken Slumber lies,

I ſtole away, and never will return,

Till England knows who did her City burn;

Till Cavaliers ſhall Favourites be deem'd,

And Loyal Sufferers by the Court eſteem'd,

Till Liegh and Galloway ſhall Bribes reject;

Thus Osburn's Golden Cheat I ſhall detect:

Till Atheiſt L—le ſhall leave this Land,

And Commons Votes ſhall Cut-Noſe Guards disband;

Till Kate a happy Mother ſhall become,

Till Charles loves Parliaments, and James hates Roome.

Ral.

What fatal Crimes make you for ever fly

Your once loved Court and Martyrs Progeny?

Brit.

A Colony of French poſſeſs the Court;

Pimps, Prieſts, Buffoons in the Privy Chamber ſport;

Such ſlimy Monſters ne'r approacht a Throne

Since Pharaoh's Days, nor ſo defil'd a Crown.

In ſacred Ear Tyrannick Arts they croak,

Pervert his Mind, and good Intentions choak;

Tell him of Golden Indies, Fairy Lands,

Leviathan, and abſolute Commands.

Thus Fairy-like the King they ſteal away,

And in his room a Changling Lewis lay.

How oft have I him to himſelf reſtor'd,

In's left the Scale, in's right hand plac'd the Sword?

Taught him their uſe, what dangers would enſue,

To them who ſtrive to ſeparate theſe two?

The bloody Scotiſh Chronicle read o're,

Shew'd him how many Kings in purple gore

Were hurl'd to Hell by cruel Tyrant Lore.

[[Page 8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=6)

The other day fam'd Spencer I did bring,

In lofty Notes Tudor's bleſt Race to ſing;

How Spain's proud Powers her Virgin Arms controul'd,

And Gold'n Days in peaceful Order roul'd;

How like ripe Fruit ſhe dropt from off her Throne,

Full of grey Hairs, good Deeds, and great Renown.

As the Jeſſean Hero did appeaſe

Sauls ſtormy Rage, and ſtopt his black Diſeaſe;

So the learn'd Bard, with Artful Song ſuppreſt

The ſwelling Paſſion of his canker'd Breaſt,

And in his Heart kind Influences ſhed

Of Country Lore by Truth and Juſtice bred:

Then, to perform the Cure ſo full begun,

To him I ſhew'd this glorious ſetting Sun.

How by her Peoples Looks purſu'd from far,

So mounted on a bright Celeſtial Car,

Out-ſhining Virgo, or the Julian Star.

Whilſt in Truths Mirrour this good Scene he ſpy'd,

Enter'd a Dame, bedeckt with ſpotted Pride,

Fair Flower de Luce within an Azure Field,

Her left Hand bears the Ancient Gallick Shield,

By her uſurp'd; her Right a bloody Sword,

Inſcrib'd Leviathan, our Soveraign Lord;

Her towry Front a fiery Meteor bears,

An Exhalation bred of Blood and Tears;

Around her Jove's lewd rav'nous Curs complain,

Pale Death, Luſt, Tortures, fill her pompous Train:

She from the eaſie King Truth's Mirrour took,

And on the Ground in ſpiteful Fall it broke;

Then frowning thus, with proud Diſdain ſhe broke.

Are thred-bare Virtues Ornaments for Kings?

Such poor Pedantick Toys teach Underlings.

Do Monarchs riſe by Virtue or by Sword?

Who e're grew great by keeping of his Word?

Virtue's a faint Green-Sickneſs to brave Souls,

Daſtards their Hearts, their active Heat controuls:

The Rival God, Monarchs of th' other World,

This mortal Poyſon amongſt Princes hold;

Fearing the mighty Projects of the great,

Shall drive them from their proud Coeleſtial Seat,

If not o're-aw'd: This new-found holy Cheat,

Thoſe pious Frauds too ſlight, t' inſnare the brave,

Are proper Acts of long-ear'd Rout t' inſlave.

Bribe hungry Prieſts to deifie your Might,

To teach your Will's, your only Rule to Right;

And ſound Damnation to all that dare deny't.

[[Page 9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=6) Thus
Heaven deſigns 'gainſt Heaven you ſhould turn,

And make them fear thoſe powers you once did ſcorn.

When all the Gobling Intereſt of Mankind,

By Hirelings ſold to you ſhall be reſign'd;

And by Impoſtures God and man betray'd,

The Church and State you ſafely may invade;

So boundleſs Law in its full power ſhines,

Whil'ſt your ſtarv'd power in Legal Fetters pines.

Shake off thoſe Baby Bands from your ſtrong Arms,

Henceforth be deaf to your old Witches Charms;

Taſt the delicious Sweets of Sovereign power,

'Tis Royal Game whole Kingdoms to deflower.

Three ſpotleſs Virgins to your Bed I'le bring,

A Sacrifice to you their God and King:

As theſe grow ſtale we'l harras human kind,

Rack Nature till new pleaſures you ſhall find,

Strong as your Reign, and beauteous as your Mind.

When ſhe had ſpoke, a confus'd Murmour roſe

Of French, Scotch, Iriſh, all my mortal Foes,

Some Engliſh too, O ſhame! diſguis'd I ſpy'd,

Led all by the wiſe Son-in-Law of Hyde;

With Fury drunk, like Baccanels they Roar,

Down wth that common Magna Charta Whore:

With joynt Conſent on helpleſs Me they flew,

And from my Charles to a baſe Goal me drew;

My Reverend Age expos'd to Scorn and Shame,

To Prigs, Bawds, Whores, was made the publick Game.

Frequent Addreſſes to my Charles I ſend,

And my ſad State did to his Care commend:

But his fair Soul transform'd by that French Dame,

Had loſt a ſenſe of Honour, Juſtice, Fame.

Like a tame Spinſter in's Seraigl he ſits,

Beſieg'id by Whores, Buffoons and Baſtards Chits;

Lull'd in Security, rowling in Luſt,

Reſigns his Crown to Angel Cromwel's Truſt.

Her Creature O—e, the Revenue ſteals,

Falſe F—ch, Knave Ang—ery, miſguide the Seals;

Mack-James the Iriſh Biggots does adore:

His French and Teague commands on ſea and ſhore:

The Scotch Scalado of our Court two Iſles,

Fale L—le with Adure all defiles.

Thus the States Right marr'd by this Helliſh Court,

And no one left theſe Furies to caſt out:

Ah Vindex come, and purge the poiſon'd State;

Deſcend, Deſcend, e're the Cure's deſperate.

Ral.

[[Page 10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=7)

Once more great Queen thy Darling ſtrive to ſave,

Reſcue him again from ſcandal and the Grave;

Preſent to's Thoughts his long ſcorn'd Parliament,

The Baſis of his Throne and Government:

In his deaf Ears ſound his dead Fathers Name,

Perhaps that Spell may his ill Soul reclaim;

Who knows what good Effects from thence may ſpring?

'Tis God-like Good to ſave a falling King.

Brit.

As eaſily learn'd Vertuoſo's may

With the Dogs Blood his gentle Kind Convey

Into the Wolf, and make him Guardian turn,

To the bleating Flock, by him ſo lately torn;

If this Imperial Juice once taint his Blood,

'Tis by no potent Antidote withſtood.

Tyrants, like Leprous Kings, for publick weal,

Should be immur'd, leſt the Contagion ſteal

Over the whole. Th' Elect of the Jeſſean Line,

To this firm Law their Scepter did reſign.

To the ſerene Venetian State I'le go,

From her ſage Mouth fam'd Principles to know;

With her, the prudence of the ancients read,

To teach my people in their ſteps to tread;

By their great Pattern ſuch a State I'le frame,

Shall eternize a glorious laſting Name.

Till then, my Raleigh teach our noble Youth,

To love Sobriety and holy Truth:

Watch and preſide over their tender Age,

Leſt Court Corruption ſhould their Soul engage:

Tell them how Arts and Arms in thy young Days

Employ'd our Youth, not Taverns, Stews and Plays:

Tell them the generous Scorn their riſe does ow

To Flattery, Pimping and a Gawdy Shew:

Teach them to ſcorn the Corwells, P—s, Neils,

The Clevelands, Osborns, Berties, Lau—ails,

Poppea, Tegoline and Arteria's Name,

Who yield to theſe in Lewdneſs, Luſt and Fame.

Make 'em admire the Talbots, Sidneys, Veres,

Drake, Cav'ndiſh, Blake, Men void of ſlaviſh Fears,

True Sons of Glory, Pillars of the State,

On whoſe fam'd Deeds all Tongues and Writers wait;

When with bright Ardour their bright Souls do burn,

Back to my deareſt Country I'le return.

Tarquin's juſt Judge and Caeſar's equal Peers,

With them I'le bring, to dry my Peoples Tears.

Publicola with healing Hands ſhall pour

Balm in their Wounds, and ſhall their Life reſtore:

[[Page 11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=7) Greek
Arts and Roman Arms in her conjoyn'd,

Shall England raiſe, relieve oppreſt Mankind.

As Jove's great Son th' infeſted Globe did free

From noxious Monſters, hell-bred Tyranny;

So ſhall my England in a Holy War,

In Triumph bear ſlain Tyrants from afar;

Her true Cruſado ſhall at laſt pull down

The Turkiſh Creſcent and the Perſian Sun.

Freed by my Labours, Fortunate Bleſt Iſle,

The Earth ſhall reſt, the Heaven ſhall on thee ſmile;

And this kind Secret for Reward ſhall give,

No Poyſonous Serpent on the Earth ſhall live.

### 1.4. On the Statue at Stocks-Market.

AS Citizens, that to their Conquerors yield,

Do at their own Charge their own Citadel build;

So Sir Robert advanced the King's Statue, a Token

Of a Broker defeated, and Lombard-ſtreet broken.

Some thought it a mighty and gracious Deed,

Obliging the City with a King on a Steed;

When with honour he might from his Word have gone back,

Who that waits for a Calm, is abſolv'd by a Wreck:

By all, it appears from the firſt to the laſt,

To be as Revenge and as Malice forecaſt,

Upon the Kings Birth Day to ſet up a Thing,

That ſhews him a Monkey, more like than a King.

When each one that paſſes, finds fault with the Horſe,

Yet all do aſſure that the King is much worſe:

And ſome by the Likeneſs, Sir Robert ſuſpect,

That he did for the K—his own Statue erect.

To ſee him ſo diſguis'd, the Herb-women chide,

Who upon their Panniers more decently ride:

And ſo looſe are his feet, that all men agree

Sir William Peak ſits more faſter than he:

But a Market they ſay doth fit the King well,

Who oft Parliaments buys, and Revenues doth ſell:

And others, to make the Similitude hold,

Say his Majeſty himſelf is oft bought and ſold.

Surely this Statue is more dangerous far,

Than all the Dutch Pictures that cauſed the War;

And what the Exchequer for that took on truſt,

May henceforth be confiſcated for Reaſons moſt juſt.

But Sir Robert, to take the Scandal away,

Doth the fault upon the Artificer lay;

[[Page 12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=8) And
alledges the thing is none of his own;

For he counterfeits only in Gold, not in Stone.

But Sir Knight of the Vine, how came't in your thought,

That when to the Sc—Id your Liege you had brought,

With Canvas and Deals you ere ſince do him cloud,

As if you had meant it his Coffin and Shroud?

Hath Blood him away, as his Crown he convey'd?

Or is he to Clayton's gone in Maſquerade?

Or is he in his Cabal in his—ſet?

Or have you to the Compter remov'd him for Debt?

Methinks for the Equipage of this vile Scene,

That to change him into a Jack-Pudding you mean,

Or elſe thus expoſe him to Popular Flout,

As tho' we had as good have a King of a Clout.

Or do you his Errors out of Modeſty vail

With three ſhatter'd Planks, and the Rags of a Sail,

To expoſe how his Navy was ſhatter'd and torn,

The day that he was reſtored and born?

If the Judges and Parliament do not him enrich,

They will ſcarcely afford him a Rag to his Breech.

Sir Robert affirms they do him much wrong;

'Tis the Gravers Work to reform ſo long.

But alas, he will never arrive at his end;

For 'tis ſuch a King no Chizzel can mend:

But with all his faults pray give us our King,

As ever you hope December or Spring:

For though the whole World cannot ſhew ſuch another,

We had better have him than his P—'d Brother.

### 1.5. A Young Gentleman, deſirous to be a Miniſter of State, thus pretends
to qualifie himſelf.

TO make my ſelf for this Employment fit,

I'le learn as much as I can ever get

Of the Honourable G—y of R—Wit:

In Conſtancy and ſincere Loyalty,

I'le imitate the grateful Shaftsbury;

And that we may aſſume the Churches weal,

And all Diſorder in Religion heal,

I will eſpouſe Lord H—'s Zeal:

[[Page 13]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=8) To pay
Reſpect to Sacred Revelation,

To ſcorn th' affected Wit of Prophanation,

And rout Impiety out of the Nation:

To ſuppreſs Vice and Scandal to prevent,

Buck—'s Life ſhall be my Precedent,

That living Modal of good Covernment.

To dive into the depth of Stateſmen's Craft,

To ſearch the Secrets of the ſubtleſt Heart,

And hide my own deſigns with prudent Art:

To make each Man my Property become,

To fruſtrate all the Plots of France or Rome,

None can ſo well inſtruct as my Lord Moon;

For Moral Honeſty in Deed and Word,

Lord W—r Example will afford;

That, and his Courage too, are on Record.

### 1.6. To the King.

GReat Charles, who full of Mercy, wouldſt command

In Peace and Pleaſure this, his Native Land;

At laſt take pity of this tottering Throne,

Shook by the Faults of others, not thine own.

Let not thy Life and Crown together end,

Deſtroy'd by a falſe Brother and a Friend.

Obſerve the danger that appears ſo near,

That all your Subjects do each minute fear:

One drop of Poiſon, or a Papiſt-Knife,

Ends all the Joy of England with thy Life.

Brothers, 'tis true, by Nature, ſhould be kind;

But a too zealous and ambitious Mind,

Brib'd with a Crown on Earth, and one above,

Harbours no Friendſhip, Tenderneſs, or Love:

See in all Ages what Examples are

Of Monarchs murther'd by their impatient Heir.

Hard Fate of Princes, who will ne're believe

Till the Stroke's ſtruck which they can ne're retrieve▪

[[Page 14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=9)

### 1.7. Noſtradamus's PROPHECY.

By A. M.

FOR Faults and Follies London's Doom ſhall fix,

And She muſt ſink in Flames in Sixty ſix;

Fire-Balls ſhall fly, but few ſhall ſee the Train,

As far as from White-hall to Pudding-Lane,

To burn the City, which again ſhall riſe,

Beyond all hopes, aſpiring to the Skies,

Where Vengeance dwells. But there is one thing more

(Though its Walls ſtand) ſhall bring the City lower:

When Legiſlators ſhall their Truſt betray,

Saving their own, ſhall give the reſt away;

And thoſe falſe men by th' eaſie People ſent,

Give Taxes to the King by Parliament:

When bare-fac'd Villains ſhall not bluſh to cheat,

And Chequer-Doors ſhall ſhut up Lumbard-ſtreet:

When Players come to act the part of Queens,

Within the Curtains, and behind the Scenes:

When Sodomy ſhall be prime Min'ſters Sport,

And Whoring ſhall be the leaſt Crime at Court:

When Boys ſhall take their Siſters for their Mate,

And practice Inceſts between Seven and Eight:

When no man knows in whom to put his truſt,

And e'en to rob the Chequer ſhall be juſt;

When Declarations, Lie, and every Oath

Shall be in uſe at Court but Faith and Troth;

When two good Kings ſhall be at Brentford Town,

And when in London there ſhall be not one;

When the ſeat's given to a talking Fool,

Whom wiſe men laugh at, and whom Women rule;

A Min'ſter able only in his Tongue,

To make harſh, empty ſpeeches two hours long;

When an old Scotch Covenant ſhall be

The Champion for th' Engliſh Hierarchy;

When Biſhops ſhall lay all Religion by,

And ſtrive by Law t' eſtabliſh Tyranny;

When a lean Treaſurer ſhall in one year

Make himſelf fat, his King and People bare;

When th' Engliſh Prince ſhall Engliſh men deſpiſe,

And think French only Loyal, Iriſh Wiſe;

[[Page 15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=9) When
Wooden Shoon ſhall be the Engliſh wear,

And Magna Charta ſhall no more appear;

Then th' Engliſh ſhall a greater Tyrant know

Than either Greek or Latin Story ſhow;

Their Wives to's Luſt expos'd, their Wealth to's Spoil,

VVith Groans to fill his Treaſury they toil;

But like the Bellides muſt ſigh in vain;

For that ſtill fill'd flows out as faſt again;

Then they with envious Eyes ſhall Belgium ſee,

And wiſh in vain Venetian Liberty.

The Frogs too late, grown weary of their pain,

Shall pray to Jove to take him back again.

### 1.8. Sir Edmondbury Godfrey's Ghoſt.

IT happen'd in the Twilight of the Day,

As England's Monarch in his Cloſet lay,

And Chiffinch ſtep'd to fetch the Female Prey;

The bloody ſhape of Godfrey did appear,

And in ſad Vocal ſounds theſe things declare:

"Behold, Great Sir, I from the Shades am ſent,

"To ſhew theſe Wounds that did your Fall prevent.

"My panting Ghoſt, as Envoy, comes to call,

"And warn you, leſt, like me, y' untimely fall;

"Who againſt Law your Subjects Lives purſue,

"By the ſame rate may dare to murther you.

"I, for Religion, Laws, and Liberties,

"Am mangled thus, and made a Sacrifice.

"Think what befel Great Egypt's hardned King,

"Who ſcorn'd the Profit of admoniſhing.

"Shake off your brandy ſlumbers; for my Words

"More Truth than all your cloſe Cabal affords:

"A Court you have with Luxury oregrown,

"And all the Vices ere in Nature known;

"VVhere Pimps and Panders in their Coaches ride,

"And in Lampoons and Songs your Luſt deride.

"Old Bawds and ſlighted VVhores, there tell, with ſhame,

"The dull Romance of your Laſcivious Flame.

"Players and Scaramouches are your Joy;

"Prieſts and French Apes do all your Land annoy;

"Still ſo profuſe, you are inſolvent grown,

"A Mighty Bankrupt on a Golden Throne.

[[Page 16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=10) "Your
nauſeous Palate the worſt Food doth crave;

"No wholſom Viands can an entrance have:

"Each Night you lodge in that French Syren's Arms

"She ſtrait betrays you with her wanton Charms;

"Works on your Heart, ſoftned with Love and Wine,

"And then betrays you to ſome Philiſtine.

"Imperial Luſt does o're your Scepter ſway;

"And though a Soveraign makes you to obey.

"Yet thoughts ſo ſtupid have your Soul poſſeſſ'd,

"As if inchanted by ſome Magick Prieſt.

"Next he who 'gainſt the Senate's Vote did wed,

"Took defil'd H. and Heſti to his Bed:

"Fiend in his Face, Apoſtle in his Name,

"Contriv'd to Wars to your eternal ſhame.

"He ancient Laws and Liberties defies;

"On ſtanding Guards and new raiſed Force relies:

"The Teagues he courts, and doth the French admire,

"And fain he would be mounted one ſtep higher.

"All this by you muſt needs be plainly ſeen,

"And yet he awes you with his darling Spleen.

"Th' unhappy Kingdom ſuffered much of Old,

"When Spencer and looſe Gaveſton controull'd;

"Yet they by juſt Decrees were timely ſent,

"To ſuffer a perpetual Baniſhment.

"But your bold States-men nothing can reſtrain,

"Their moſt enormous Courſes you maintain;

"Witneſs that Man, who had for divers years

"Pay'd the Cubb-Commons, Penſions and Arrears;

"Though your Exchequer was at his Command,

"Durſt not before his juſt Accuſer ſtand,

"For Crimes and Treaſons of ſo black a hue,

"None dare to prove his Advocate but you.

"Truſt not in Prelates falſe Divinity,

"Who wrong their Prince, and ſhame their Deity,

"Making their God ſo partial in their Cauſe,

"Exempting Kings alone from humane Laws.

"Theſe lying Oracles they did infuſe

"Of old, and did your Martyr'd Sire abuſe.

"Their ſtrong deluſions did him ſo inthral,

"No Cautions would anticipate his Fall.

"Repent in time, and baniſh from your ſight

"The Pimp, the Whore, Buffoon, Church-paraſite;

"Let Innocence deck your remaining days,

"That After-ages may unfold your Praiſe.

"So may Hiſtorians in new Methods write,

"And draw a Curtain 'twixt your black and white.

The Ghoſt ſpake thus, groan'd thrice, and ſaid no more:

Straight in came Chiffinch hand in hand with Whore:

The King tho' much concern'd with Joy and Fear,

Starts from the Couch and bid the Dame draw near.

### 1.9. Ʋpon the King's Voyage to Chatham, to make Bulwarks againſt the
Dutch: And the Queen's miſcarriage thereupon.

WHen James our great Monarch, ſo Wiſe and Diſcreet:

Was gone with three Barges, to face the Dutch Fleet▪

Our young Prince of Wales (by inheritance ſtout!)

Was coming to aid him and peep'd his Head out;

But ſeeing his Father without Ships or Men,

Commit the defence of us all to a Chain,

Taffee was frighted, and ſculk'd in again;

Nor thought, while the Dutch domineer'd on our Road▪

It was ſafe to come further, and venture abroad:

Not Walgrave, or th' Epiſtle of Seignieur le Duke,

Made Her Majeſty Sick, and her Royal Womb puke:

But the Dutch-men Pickeering at Dover and Harwich,

Gave the Miniſters Agues, and the Queen a Miſcarriage;

And to ſee the poor King ſtand in Ships of ſuch need,

Made the Catholicks quake, and Her Majeſty bleed;

And I wiſh the ſad Accident don't ſpoil the young Prince,

Take off all his Manhood, and make him a Wench:

But the Hero his Father no courage did lack;

Who was ſorry on ſuch a pretext to come back:

He mark'd out his ground, and mounted a Gun,

And 'tis thought without ſuch a pretence he had run;

For his Army and Navy were ſaid to increaſe,

As appears (when we have no occaſion) in Peace:

Nay, if the Dutch come, we deſpiſe 'em ſo much,

Our Navy Incognito will leave 'em i'th' Lurch,

And (to their eternal Diſgrace) we are able

To beat 'em by way of a Poſt and a Cable;

Why was this, Sir, left out of the Wiſe Declaration,

That flatter'd with Hopes of more Forces, the Nation?

'Twould have done us great good to have ſaid, you intended,

The ſtrength of the Nation the CHAIN ſhould be mended;

Though we thank you, for Paſſing ſo kindly your Word,

(Which never was broke) that you'd Rule by the Sword;

This Promiſe we know you meant to fulfill;

And therefore you have reaſon (by Gad) to tak't ill,

That the Biſhops, the Biſhops did throw out the Bill.

## 2\. Three POEMS on the Death of the late Uſurper Oliver Cromwell.

Written by Mr. John Dryden, Mr. Sprat of Oxford, and Mr. Edm. Waller.

### 2.1. Heroick Stanza's, on the late Ʋſurper Oliver Crom­well, written after
his Funeral, by Mr. Dryden.

I.

AND now 'tis time; for their officious haſt,

Who would before have born him to the Sky,

Like eager Romans e're all Rites were paſt,

Did let to ſoon the ſacred Eagle fly.

II.

Though our beſt Notes are Treaſon to his Fame,

Join'd with the loud applauſe of publick Voice;

Since Heaven, what praiſe we offer to his Name,

Hath rendred too Authentick by its choice;

III.

Though in his praiſe no Arts can liberal be,

Since they whoſe Muſes have the higheſt flown,

Add not to his Immortal Memory;

But do an act of Friendſhip to their own:

IV.

Yet 'tis our duty, and our intereſt too,

Such Monuments as we can build, to raiſe,

Leſt all the World prevent what we ſhould do,

And claim a Title in him by their Praiſe.

V.

How ſhall I then begin, or where conclude,

To draw a Fame ſo truly Circular?

For in a round, what order can be ſhew'd,

Where all the parts ſo equal perfect are?

VI.

His Grandeur he deriv'd from Heaven alone,

For he was great ere Fortune made him ſo,

And Wars like Miſts that riſe againſt the San,

Made him but greater ſeem, not greater grow.

[[Page 22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=11)

VII.

No borrow'd Bays his Temples did adorn,

But to our Crown he did freſh Jewels bring;

Nor was his Vertue poiſon'd ſoon as born,

With the too early thoughts of being King.

VIII.

Fortune (that eaſie Miſtriſs to the young,

But to her ancient Servants coy and hard)

Him, at that age, her Favourites rank'd among,

When ſhe her beſt lov'd Pompey did diſcard.

IX.

He private, mark'd the Faults of others ſway,

And ſet as Sea-marks for himſelf to ſhun;

Not like raſh Monarchs, who their youth betray,

By Acts their Age too late would wiſh undone.

X.

And yet Dominion was not his deſign,

We owe that bleſſing not to him but Heaven,

Which to fair acts unſought rewards did join,

Rewards that leſs to him, than us were given.

XI.

Our former Chief like Sticklers of the War,

Firſt ſought t'inflame the parties, then to poiſe:

The quarrel lov'd, but did the cauſe abhor,

And did not ſtrike to hurt, but make a noiſe.

XII.

War, our Conſumption, was their gainful Trade;

He inward bled, whilſt they prolong'd our pain;

He fought to end our fighting, and aſſay'd

To ſtanch the blood by breathing of the Vein.

XIII.

Swift and reſiſtleſs through the Land he paſt,

Like that bold Greek, who did the Eaſt ſubdue,

And made to Battels ſuch Heroick haſte,

As if on Wings of Victory he flew.

XIV.

He Fought ſecure of Fortune as of Fame,

Still by new Maps the Iſland might be ſhown,

Of Conqueſts which he ſtrew'd where e're he came,

Thick as the Galaxy with Stars is ſown.

XV.

His Palms, though under weights they did not ſtand,

Still thriv'd, no Winter could his Laurels fade:

Heaven in his Portraict ſhew'd a Workman's hand,

And drew it perfect, yet without a ſhade.

[[Page 20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=12)

XVI.

Peace was the prize of all his toil and care,

Which War had baniſhd, and did now reſtore:

Bolognia's Walls thus mounted in the Air,

To ſeat themſelves more ſurely than before:

XVII.

Her ſafety, reſcued Ireland, to him owes,

And treacherous Scotland to no int'reſt true,

Yet bleſs'd that Fate which did his Arms diſpoſe

Her Land to civilize, as to ſubdue.

XVIII.

Nor was he like thoſe Stars which only ſhine,

When to pale Mariners, they Storms portend;

He had his calmer influences, and his Mien

Did Love and Majeſty together blend.

XIX.

Tis true his Countenance did imprint an awe,

And naturally all Souls to his did bow,

As wands of Divination downward draw,

And point to beds where Sov'raign Gold doth grow.

XX.

When paſt all offerings to Pheretrian Jove,

He Mars depoſed, and Arms to Gowns made yield,

Succeſsful Councels did him ſoon approve,

As fit for cloſe Intrigues, as open Field.

XXI.

To ſuppliant Holland he vouchſaf'd a Peace,

Our once bold Rival in the Britiſh Main,

Now tamely glad her unjuſt claim to ceaſe,

And buy our Friendſhip with her Idol, Gain.

XXII.

Fame of the aſſerted Sea through Europe blown,

Made France and Spain ambitious of his Love;

Each knew that ſide muſt conquer he would own,

And for him fiercely, as for Empire ſtrove.

XXIII.

No ſooner was the French-man's Cauſe imbrac'd,

Than the light Monſieur, the grave Don outweigh'd;

His Fortune turn'd the Scale where it was caſt;

Though Indian Mines where in the other laid.

XXIV.

When abſent, yet we conquer'd in his Right;

For though that ſome mean Artiſt's Skill were ſhown

In mingling Colours, or in placing Light;

Yet ſtill the fair Deſignment was his own.

[[Page 21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=12)

XXV.

For from all Tempers he could Service draw;

The worth of each with its allay he knew;

And as the Confident of Nature ſaw

How ſhe Complections did divide and brew.

XXVI.

Or he their ſingle Vertues did ſurvey,

By intuition in his own large Breaſt,

Where all the rich Idea's of them lay,

That were the Rule and Meaſure to the reſt.

XXVII.

When ſuch Heroick Vertue, Heaven ſet out:

The Stars like Commons ſullenly obey;

Becauſe it drains them when it comes about;

And therefore is a Tax they ſeldom pay.

XXVIII.

From this high Spring, our Foreign Conqueſts flow,

Which yet more glorious Triumphs do portend;

Since their Commencement to his Arms they owe,

If ſprings as high as Fountains may aſcend.

XXXIX.

He made us Free-men of the Continent,

Whom Nature did like Captives treat before;

To Nobler preys the Engliſh Lion ſent,

And taught him firſt in Belgian Walks to roar.

XXX.

That old unqueſtion'd Pirate of the Land,

Proud Rome, with dread the Fate of Dunkirk heard;

And trembling wiſh'd behind more Alpes to ſtand,

Although an Alexander were her Guard.

XXXI.

By his Command, we boldly croſs'd the Line,

And bravely fought where Southern Stars ariſe,

We trac'd the far-fetch'd Gold unto the Mine,

And that which brib'd our Fathers made our Prize.

XXXII.

Such was our Prince, yet own'd a Soul above

The higheſt Acts it could produce or ſhow:

Thus poor Mechanick Arts in publick move,

Whilſt the deep Secrets beyond Practice go.

XXXIII.

Nor died he when his ebbing Fame went leſs,

But when the freſh Laurels courted him to live;

He ſeem'd but to prevent ſome new Succeſs,

As if above what Triumphs Earth can give.

[[Page 19]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=13)

XXXIV.

His la teſt Victories ſtill thickeſt came,

As near the Center, Motion doth increaſe;

Till he preſs'd down by his own weighty Name,

Did, like the Veſtal, under ſpoils deceaſe.

XXXV.

But firſt the Ocean as a Tribute ſent

That Giant Prince of all her wat'ry Herd;

And th' Iſle, when her protecting Genius went,

Upon his Obſequies loud ſighs conferr'd.

XXXVI.

No civil broils have fince his Death aroſe,

But Faction now by habit does obey;

And Wars have that reſpect for his Repoſe,

As Winds for Halcyons when they breed at Sea.

XXXVII.

His Aſhes in a peaceful Urn ſhall reſt,

His Name a great Example ſtands to ſhow,

How ſtrangely high Endeavours may be bleſt,

Where Piety, and Valour jointly go.

### 2.2. To the Reverend Dr. Wilkins, Warden of Wadham Colledge in Oxford.

SIR,

SEeing you are pleaſed to think fit that theſe Papers ſhould come into the
pub­lick, which were at firſt deſign'd to live only in a Desk, or ſome private
Friends Hands; I humbly take the boldneſs to commit them to the ſecurity,
which your Name and protection will give them, with the moſt knowing part of
the World. There are two things eſpecially, in which they ſtand in need of
your defence: One is, That they fall ſo infinitely below the full and lofty
Ge­nius of that excellent Poet, who made this way of Writing Free of our
Nation: The other, That they are ſo little proportioned and equal to the
renown of that Prince, on whom they were written. Such great Actions and
Lives, deſerv­ing rather to be the ſubjects of the nobleſt Pens and most
Divine Phanſies, than of ſuch ſmall Beginners and week Eſſayers in Poetry as
my ſelf. Againſt theſe dangerous prejudices, there remains no other ſhield,
than the Univerſal Eſteem and Authority, which your Judgment and Approbation
carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir, is not only on the account
of the Relation you had to this great Perſon, nor of the general favour which
all arts receive from you; but more particularly by reaſon of that Obligation
and Zeal, with which I am bound to dedicate my ſelf to your ſervice: For
having been a long [[Page
18]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=13) time the Object
of your Care and Indulgence towards the advantage of my Stu­dies and Fortune,
having been moulded (as it were) by your own Hands, and formed under your
Government; not to intitle you to any thing which my mean­neſs produces, would
not only be Injuſtice, but Sacriledge: So that if there be any thing here
tolerably ſaid, which deſerves Pardon, it is yours Sir, as well as he, who is

Your moſt Devoted and Obliged Servant.

### 2.3. To the happy memory of the late Uſurper Oliver Cromwel. By Mr. Sprat
of Oxon. Pindarick Odes.

I.

'TIS true, great Name, thou art ſecure

From the forgetfulneſs and rage

Of Death, or Envy, or devouring Age;

Thou canſt the Force and Teeth of Time endure:

Thy Fame like Men, the elder it doth grow,

Will of its ſelf turn whiter too,

Without what needleſs art can do;

Will live beyond thy breath, beyond thy Hearſe,

Though it were never heard or ſung in Verſe.

Without our help, thy Memory is ſafe;

They only want an Epitaph,

That does remain alone

Alive in an Inſcription,

Remembred only on the Braſs, or Marble ſtone.

'Tis all in vain what we can do:

All our Roſes and Perfumes

Will but officious folly ſhew,

And pious Nothings, to ſuch mighty Tombs.

All our Incenſe, Gums, and Balm,

Are but unneceſſary duties here:

The Poets may their Spices ſpare,

Their coſtly numbers and their tuneful feet:

That need not be imbalm'd, which of it ſelf is ſweet.

II.

We know to praiſe thee is a dangerous proof

Of our Obedience and our Love:

For when the Sun and Fire meet,

Th' one's extinguiſh'd quite;

And yet the other never is more bright:

So they that write of thee, and join

Their feeble names with Thine,

Their weaker ſparks with thy illuſtrious light,

[[Page 24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=14) Will
loſe themſelves in that ambitious thought;

And yet no Fame to thee from thence he brought.

We know, bleſs'd Spirit, thy mighty name

Wants no addition of anothers beam;

It's for our pens too high, and full of Theme:

The Muſes are made great by thee, not thou by them.

Thy Fame's Eternal Lamp will live,

And in thy Sacred Urn ſurvive,

Without the food of Oil, which we can give.

'Tis true; but yet our duty calls our Songs,

Duty Commands our Tongues.

Though thou want not our praiſes, we

Are not excus'd for what we owe to thee;

For ſo Men from Religion are not freed.

But from the Altars clouds muſt riſe,

Though Heaven it ſelf doth nothing need,

And though the Gods don't want an earthly Sacrifice

III.

Great Life of wonders, whoſe each year

Full of new Miracles did appear!

Whoſe every Month might be

Alone a Chronicle, or a Hiſtory!

Others great Actions are

But thinly ſcatter'd here and there;

At beſt, but all one ſingle Star;

But thine the Milky-way,

All one continued light of undiſtinguiſh'd day;

They throng'd ſo cloſe, that nought elſe could be ſeen,

Scarce any common Sky did come between:

What ſhall I ſay or where begin?

Thou may'ſt in double ſhapes be ſhown,

Or in thy Arms, or in thy Gown;

Like Jove ſometimes with Warlike Thunder, and

Sometimes with peaceful Scepter in his Hand,

Or in the Field, or on the Throne.

In what thy Head, or what thy Arm hath done,

All that thou didſt was ſo refin'd,

So full of ſubſtance, and ſo ſtrongly join'd,

So pure, ſo weighty Gold,

That the leaſt Grain of it

If fully ſpread and beat,

Would many Leaves and mighty Volumes hold▪

IV.

Before thy Name was publiſh'd, and whilſt yet

Thou only to thy ſelf wer't great,

[[Page 28]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=14) Whilſt
yet thy happy bud

Was not quite ſeen, or underſtood,

It then ſure ſigns of future greatneſs ſhew'd:

Then thy Domeſtick worth

Did tell the World what it would be,

When it ſhould fit occaſion ſee,

When a full Spring ſhould call it forth:

As Bodies, in the dark and night,

Have the ſame Colours, the ſame red and white,

As in the open Day and Light,

The Sun doth only ſhow

That they are bright, not make them ſo:

So whilſt but private Walls did know

What we to ſuch a mighty Mind ſhould owe,

Then the ſame Vertues did appear,

Though in a leſs and more contracted Sphere,

As full, though not as large as ſince they were:

And like great Rivers, Fountains, though

At firſt ſo deep thou didſt not go;

Though then thine was not ſo inlarg'd a Flood;

Yet when 'twas little, 'twas as clear as good.

V.

'Tis true thou waſt not born unto a Crown,

Thy Scepter's not thy Father's, but thy own:

Thy purple was not made at once in haſte,

And after many other Colours paſt,

It took the deepeſt Princely Dye at laſt.

Thou didſt begin with leſſer Cares,

And private thoughts took up thy private Years:

Thoſe Hands, which were ordain'd by Fates,

To change the World, and alter States,

Practis'd at firſt that vaſt Deſign

On meaner things with equal Mind.

That Soul, which ſhould ſo many Scepters ſway,

To whom ſo many Kingdoms ſhould obey:

Learned firſt to rule in a Domeſtick way:

So Government it ſelf, began

From Family, and ſingle Man,

Was by the ſmall Relations, firſt,

Of Husband, and of Father Nurs'd,

And from thoſe leſs beginnings paſt,

To ſpread it ſelf o'er all the World at laſt.

VI.

But when thy Country, (then almoſt enthrall'd)

Thy Vertue, and thy Courage call'd;

[[Page 26]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=15) When
England did thy Arms intreat,

And 't had been Sin in thee not to be Great:

When every Stream, and every Flood,

Was a true Vein of Earth, and run with Blood;

When unus'd Arms, and unknown War

Fill'd every Place, and ever Ear;

When the great Storms, and diſmal Night

Did all the Land affright;

'Twas time for thee, to bring forth all our Light.

Thou left'ſt thy more delightful Peace,

Thy private Life, and better eaſe;

Then down thy Steel and Armour took,

Wiſhing that it ſtill hung upon the Hook.

When Death had got a large Commiſſion out,

Throwing her Arrows, and her Stings about;

Then thou (as once the healing Serpent roſe)

Waſt lifted up, not for thy ſelf, but us.

VII.

Thy Country wounded was, and ſick before

Thy Wars and Arms did her reſtore:

Thou knew'ſt where the Diſeaſe did lie,

And like the Cure of Sympathy,

Thy ſtrong, and certain Remedy,

Unto the Weapon didſt apply;

Thou didſt not draw the Sword, and ſo

Away the Scabbard throw;

As if thy Country ſhou'd

Be the Inheritance of Mars and Blood;

But that when the great work was ſpun,

War in it ſelf ſhould be undone;

That Peace might Land again upon the ſhore,

Richer and better than before:

The Husbandmen no Steel ſhould know,

None but the uſeful Iron of the Plow;

That Bays might creep on every Spear:

And though our Sky was overſpread

With a deſtructive red;

'Twas but till thou our Sun didſt in full Light appear.

VIII.

When Ajax died, the Purple Blood

That from his gaping Wound had flow'd,

Turn'd into Letters, every Leaf

Had on it wrote his Epitaph:

So from that Crimſon Flood

Which thou, by fate of times, wert led

Unwillingly to ſhed,

Letters, and Learning roſe, and were renewed:

[[Page 27]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=15) Thou
fought'ſt not out of Envy, Hope, or Hate,

But to refine the Church and State,

And like the Romans, what e'er thou

In the Field of Mars didſt mow,

Was, that a holy Iſland thence might grow.

Thy Wars, as Rivers raiſed by a Shower,

With welcome Clouds do pour:

Though they at firſt may ſeem,

To carry all away with an inraged Stream;

Yet did not happen that they might deſtroy,

Or the better parts annoy:

But all the Filth and Mud to ſcour,

And leave behind anothr ſlime,

To give a Birth to a more happy Power.

IX.

In Fields unconquer'd, and ſo well

Thou did'ſt in Battels and in Arms excel,

That ſteely Arms themſelves, might be

Worn out in War as ſoon as thee.

Succeſs, ſo cloſe upon thy Troops did wait,

As if thou firſt had'ſt conquer'd Fate;

As if uncertain Victory

Had been firſt overcome by thee;

As if her Wings were clipp'd, and could not flee,

Whilſt thou did'ſt only ſerve,

Before thou had'ſt what firſt thou did'ſt deſerve.

Others by thee did great things do,

Triumph'd'ſt thy ſelf, and made'ſt them triumph too;

Though they above thee did appear,

As yet in a more large, and higher Sphere:

Thou, the great Sun gav'ſt Light to every Star.

Thy ſelf an Army wert alone,

And mighty Troops contain'dſt in one:

Thy only Sword did guard the Land,

Like that which flaming in the Angel's Hand,

From Men God's Garden did defend:

But yet thy Sword did more than his,

Not only guarded, but did make this Land a Paradiee.

X.

Thou fought'ſt not to be high or great,

Not for a Scepter, or a Crown,

Or Ermyn, People, or the Throne:

But as the Veſtal Heat▪

Thy Fire was kindled from above alone;

[[Page 29]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=16) Religion
putting on thy Shield,

Brought thee victorious to the Field.

Thy Arms like thoſe, which ancient Heroes wore,

Were given by the God thou did'ſt adore;

And all the Words thy Armies had,

Were on an heavenly Anvil made;

Not Int'reſt, or any weak deſire

Of Rule, or Empire did thy mind inſpire;

Thy Valour like the holy Fire,

Which did before the Perſian Armies go,

Liv'd in the Camp, and yet was ſacred too:

Thy mighty Sword anticipates,

What was reſerv'd for Heaven and thoſe bleſs'd Seats,

And makes the Church Triumphant here below.

XI.

Though Fortune did hang on thy Sword,

And did obey thy mighty Word;

Though Fortune for thy ſide and thee,

Forgot her lov'd Unconſtancy;

Amidſt thy Arms and Trophies thou

Wert valiant and gentle too,

Wounded'ſt thy ſelf, when thou did'ſt kill thy Foe;

Like Steel, when it much Work has paſt,

That which was rough does ſhine at laſt:

Thy Arms by being oftner us'd did ſmoother grow;

Nor did thy Battels make the proud or high;

Thy Conqueſt rais'd the State, not thee:

Thou overcam'ſt thy ſelf in every Victory:

As when the Sun, in a directer Line,

Upon a poliſh'd golden Shield doth ſhine,

The Shield reflects unto the Sun again his Light:

So when the Heavens ſmil'd on thee in Fight,

When thy propitious God had lent

Succeſs, and Victory to thy Tent,

To Heav'n again the Victory was ſent.

XII.

England till thou did'ſt come,

Confin'd her Valour home;

Then our own Rocks did ſtand

Bounds to our Fame as well as Land,

And were to us as well,

As to our Enemies unpaſſable.

We were aſham'd at what we read,

And bluſh'd at what our Fathers did,

Becauſe we came ſo far behind the Dead▪

[[Page 32]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=16) The
Britiſh Lion hung his main, and droop'd,

To Slavery and Burthen ſtoop'd,

With a degenarate Sleep and Fear

Lay in his Den, and languiſh'd there;

At whoſe leaſt Voice before,

A trembling eccho ran through every Shore,

And ſhook the World at every roar;

Thou his ſubdued Courage didſt reſtore,

Sharpen his Claws, and in his Eyes

Mad'ſt the ſame dreadful Lightning riſe;

Mad'ſt him again affright the Neighbouring Floods,

His mighty Thunder ſound through all the Woods▪

Thou haſt our Military Fame redeem'd,

Which was loſt, or clouded ſeem'd:

Nay more, Heaven did by thee beſtow

On us, at once an Iron Age, and happy too.

XIII.

Till thou command'ſt, that Azure Chains of Waves,

Which Nature round about us ſent,

Made us to every Pirate Slaves,

Was rather Burthen than an Ornament;

Thoſe Fields of Sea, that waſh'd our Shores,

Were plow'd, and reap'd by other Hands than ours.

To us, the liquid Maſs,

Which doth about us run,

As it is to the Sun,

Only a Bed to ſleep on was:

And not, as now a powerful Throne,

To ſhake and ſway the World thereon.

Our Princes in their Hand a Globe did ſhew,

But not a perfect one,

Compos'd of Earth, and Water too.

But thy Commands the Floods obey'd,

Thou all the Wilderneſs of VVater ſway'd;

Thou did'ſt but only wed the Sea,

Not make her equal, but a Slave to thee.

Neptune himſelf did bear thy Yoke,

Stoop'd, and trembled at thy ſtroke:

He that ruled all the Main,

Acknowledg'd thee his Soveraign.

And now the Conquer'd Sea, doth pay

More Tribute to thy Thames, than that unto the Sea.

XIV.

Till now our Valour did our ſelves more hurt;

Our VVounds to other Nations were a ſport;

And as the Earth, our Land produc'd

[[Page 30]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=17) Iron and
Steel, which ſhould to tear our ſelves be us'd.

Our ſtrength within it ſelf did break,

Like thundring Canons crack,

And kill'd thoſe that were near,

While the Enemies ſecur'd and untouch'd were.

But now our Trumpets thou haſt made to ſound,

Againſt our Enemies Walls in Foreign Ground;

And yet no eccho back to us returning found.

England is now the happy peaceful Iſle,

And all the World the while,

Is exerciſing Arms and Wars,

With Foreign, or inteſtine Jars.

The Torch extinguiſh'd here, we lend to others Oil,

We give to all, yet know our ſelves no Fear;

We reach the Flame of Ruine, and of Death,

Where e're we pleaſe, our Swords to unſheath,

Whilſt we in calm, and temporate Regions breath;

Like to the Sun, whoſe heat is hurl'd

Through every Corner of the World;

Whoſe Flame through all the Air doth go;

And yet the Sun himſelf, the while no Fire doth know.

XV.

Beſides the Glories of thy Peace,

Are not in Number, nor in value leſs.

Thy Hand did cure, and cloſe the Stars

Of our bloody Civil Wars;

Not only lanc'd; but heal'd the Wound,

Made us again as healthy, and as ſound,

When now the Ship was well nigh loſt,

After the Storm upon the Coaſt,

By its Mariners indanger'd moſt;

When they their Ropes and helms had left,

When the Planks aſunder cleft,

And Flouds came roaring in with mighty ſound;

Thou a ſafe Land, and harbour for us found,

And ſaved'ſt thoſe that would themſelves have drown'd:

A Work which none but Heaven and thee could do,

Thou made'ſt us happy▪ whe'r we would or no:

Thy Judgment, Mercy, Temperance ſo great,

As if thoſe Vettues only in thy Mind had ſeat:

Thy Piety not only in the Field, but Peace,

When Heaven ſeemed to be wanted leaſt:

Thy Temples not like Janus open were,

Open in time of War,

When thou hadſt greater cauſe of fear

[[Page 31]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=17) Religion
and the awe of Heaven poſſeſt

All places and all times alike thy breaſt.

XVI:

Nor didſt thou only for thy age provide,

But for the years to come beſide;

Our after-times, and late Poſterity,

Shall pay unto thy Fame as much as we;

They too are made by thee:

When Fate did call thee to a higher Throne,

And when thy Mortal Work was done,

When Heaven did ſay it, and thou muſt be gone,

Thou him to bear thy burthen choſe,

Who might (if any could) make us forget thy loſs:

Nor hadſt thou him deſign'd,

Had he not been

Not only to thy Blood, but Vertue kin;

Not only Heir unto thy Throne, but Mind,

'Tis he ſhall perfect all thy Cures,

And with as fine a thread weave out thy loom:

So one did bring the choſen People from

Their Slavery and Fears,

Led them through their pathleſs road,

Guided himſelf by God.

He brought them to the Borders; but a ſecond Hand

Did ſettle, and ſecure them in the promiſed Land.

### 2.4. Ʋpon the late Storm, and Death of the late Ʋſurper Oliver Cromwel
enſuing the ſame, By Mr. Waller.

WE muſt reſign; Heav'n his great Soul does claim,

In Storms as loud, as his Immortal Fame;

His dying Groans, his laſt breath ſhakes our Iſle,

And trees uncut fall for his Funeral Pile.

About his Palace their broad roots are toſt

Into the Air: So Romulus was loſt.

New Rome in ſuch a Tempeſt miſt their King,

And from obeying-fell to Worſhipping.

On Oeta's top thus Hercules lay dead,

With ruin'd Oaks and Pines about him ſpread;

The Poplar too, whoſe bough he wont to wear

On his Victorious head, lay proſtrate there:

Thoſe his laſt Fury from the Mountain rent;

Our dying Hero, from the Continent,

[[Page 33]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=172211&page=18) Raviſh'd
whole Towns, and Forts from Spaniards reft,

As his laſt Legacy to Britain left;

The Ocean which ſo long our hopes confin'd,

Could give no limits to his vaſter mind;

Our bounds enlargement, was his lateſt toil,

Nor hath he left us Priſoners to our Iſle:

Under the Tropick is our Language ſpoke,

And part of Flanders hath receiv'd our Yoke.

From Civil broils, he did us diſingage,

Found Nobler Objects for our Martial rage;

And with wiſe Conduct to his Country ſhow'd,

Their ancient way of Conquering abroad:

Ungrateful then, if we no tears allow

To him, that gave us Peace and Empire too;

Princes that fear'd him, griev'd, concern'd to ſee

No pitch of Glory from the Grave is free;

Nature her ſelf, took notice of his Death,

And ſighing ſwell'd the Sea with ſuch a breath,

That to remoteſt ſhores her Billows rowl'd,

Th' approaching Fate of her great Ruler told.

FINIS.
