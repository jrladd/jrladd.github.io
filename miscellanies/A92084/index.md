## 1\. THE RUMP DOCK'T

TIll it be underſtood

What is under Monck's Hood,

The City dare not ſhew his horns:

Till ten daies be out,

The Speaker's ſick of the Gout,

And the Rump doth ſit upon thorns.

If Monck be turn'd Scot

The Rump goes to pot,

And the Good Old Cauſe will miſcarry;

Like coals out of embers,

Revive the Old Members:

Off goes the Rump, like Dick and Harry.

Then In come the Lords,

Who drew Parlament ſwords,

With Robes lined through with Ermin;

But Peers without Kings

Are very uſeleſs things,

And their Lordſhips counted but Vermin

Now Morley and Fagg

May be put in a bagg,

And that doughty man Sir Arthur;

In deſpair for his Foil,

With Alderman Hoyle,

Will become a Knight of the Garter.

That Knave in Grain

Sir Harry Vane

His caſe then moſt mens is ſadder;

There is little hope

He can ſcape the rope,

For the Rump turn'd him o're the Ladder.

That pretious Saint Scott

Shall not be forgot,

According to his own deſires;

Inſtead of Neck-verſe

Shall have it writ on his Horſe,

Here hangs one of the Kings Triers.

Thoſe nine ſons of Mars

That whipt the Rumps Arſe,

I mean the Commanders War-lick;

If the Rump ſmell ſtrong

With hanging too long,

Shall ſerve to ſtuff it with Garlick.

That parcel of man

In length but a ſpan,

Whoſe wife's Eggs alwaies are addle;

Muſt quit the Life-guard,

As he did when skar'd

By Lambert out of the ſaddle.

Lambert now may turn Floriſt,

Being come off the pooreſt

That ever did man of the Sword:

The Rump let a fart

Which took away his heart,

And made him a Squire of a Lord.

His Cheſhire glory

Is a pitiful ſtory,

There the Saints triumpht without battle;

But now Monck and his Friers

Have driven him into the Briers,

As he did Booth and his Cattle.

For the reſt of the Rump,

Together in a lump,

'Tis too late to cry▪ Peccavi:

Yee have ſinn'd all or moſt

Againſt the Holy Ghoſt,

And therefore the Divel muſt have ye.

But now valiant City,

Whether muſt thy Ditty

Be ſung in Verie, ot in Proſe;

For till the Rump [...]unk

For fear of Monck,

Thy Militia durſt not ſhew Its Noſe.

Baſe Cowards and Knaves,

That firſt made us ſlaves,

Very Raſcals from the beginning;

Onely unto Moncks Sword

The Nation muſt afford

The honour of bringing the King in.
