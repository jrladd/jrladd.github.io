But alas brother, the world is now grown to such a passe, that men will not believe any thing to be true, unlesse it be done upon their own persons, or in their own houses. Therefore for your further satisfaction, I have sent you my only daugh­ter, with two letters, that you may with a lamenting heart behold her sorrow: there may you see the body of her, whom the villains abused: there may you see in what manner her hair was torn from her head, because she would not yeeld to their lust: there may you discern how her hair was cut off, be­cause she sought to resist their tyrannicall cruelty: there may you also perceive, how her tongue was cut out of her mouth, because she would not blas­pheme against her Maker. This woful spectacle have I sent unto you, that when you have seen her perple­xity that she is in, you may bewaile her calamities: <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e224"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65114&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> and these Letters haue I sent by her, because her tongue is cut out, that she cannot expresse her mind.

When the Master and his men perceived themselvs in such a grievous streight, they kept fast the fore doors, and fled out at the backe door, and some over the draw-bridg, together with the Mistris and her Children, and the Maid-servants all in generall, hoping thereby to save their lives. But see how they ran out of one danger into another, the men because they were constrained to help the wo­men kind, cast away all their armes, that the enemy might not overtake them in running, and so for suc­cour they ran into a wood to hide themselves from their following foes, and having gathered together a deale of Ferne, they made them lodging under the trees: in which miserable night the Mistris was de­livered of a man-child in that desert place. But here comes the griefe of all, it chanced so that in the dead time of the night, a Wolfe that had bin chased the day before, comming neere unto the place where these distressed people lay, and having scented them came to them, and ceised upon one of the maids, and bit her by the arm, and by the left breast, before shee could make any means to shift for her self.</p><p>At last, crying out for help, one of the men which had a sword, drew it to save the maids life, The subtle wolf, finding himself like to be over-matcht, ran straightways to asleep hill, and sat thereon, and ther­withall <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e343"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65114&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> made such a howling noise, that hee called such a number of wolves together, that all the power they had was not able to resist them, some that had swo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ds fought for themselves, and some that could climbe got upon trees, the rest were torn in pieces by the ravening wolvs, to the number of 14. amongst the rest, the tender mother and her new-born infant served to suffice the hungry maws of the devouring monstrous wolves.
