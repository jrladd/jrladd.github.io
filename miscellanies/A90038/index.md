## 1\. A NEW-YEARS-GIFT FOR THE RUMP.

YOu may have heard of the Politique Snout,

Or a tale of a Tub, with the bottom out,

But ſcarce of a Parliament in a ſhitten clout.

Which no body can deny.

'Twas Atkins firſt ſerv'd this Rump in with Muſtard,

The Sawce was a compound of Courage, and Cuſtard;

Sr. Vane bleſs'd the Creature: Nollſnufled, and Bluster'd.

Which no body can deny.

The Right was as then, in Old Olivers Noſe,

But when the Devil, of that did diſpoſe,

It Deſcended from thence, to the Rump, in the Cloze.

Which no body can deny.

Nor is it likely there to ſtay long,

The Retentive faculties being gone,

The Juggle is ſtale, and Money there's none.

Which no body can deny.

The Secluded Members made a Trial

To Enter, but them the Rump did defy all,

By the Ordinance of Self-denial.

Which no body can deny.

Our Politique Doctors do us Teach,

That a Bloud-ſucking Red-coat's as good as a Leech,

To Relieve the Head, if appli'd to the Breech.

Which no body can deny.

But never was ſuch a worm as Vane;

When the State ſcour'd laſt, it voided him then,

Yet now he's crept into the Rump again.

VVhich no body can deny.

Ludlow's Fart, was a Phrophetique Trump:

(There never was any thing ſo Jump)

'Twas the very Type, of a vote of this Rump.

VVhich no body can deny.

They ſay 'tis good Luck, when a Body riſes

With the Rump upward; but he that adviſes

to Live in that Poſture, is none of the wiſeſt.

Which no body can deny.

The Reaſon is worſe, though the Rime be Untoward,

When things proceed with the wrong end Forward,

But they ſay their's ſad news to the Rump, from the Nor'ward.

VVhich no body can deny.

'Tis a wonderfull thing the ſtrength of that Part,

At a Blaſt, it will take you a Team from a Cart;

And Blow a mans Head away with a Fart.

VVhich no body can deny.

When our Brains are Sunck below the Middle,

And our Conſcience ſteer'd by the hey down-Diddle,

Then things will go round without a Fiddle.

Which no body can deny.

You may Order the City with a Hand-Granado,

Or the General with a Bastonado,

But no way for a Rump like a Carbonado.

Which no body can deny.

To make us as famous in Council, as Wars,

Here's Lenthal, a Speaker for mine —

And Fleetwood is a man of Mars.

Which no body can deny.

'Tis pitty that Nedham's Fall'n into Diſgrace,

For he Orders a Bumme with a marvellous Grace,

And ought to attend the Rump by his Place.

Which no body can deny.

Yet this in ſpight of all Diſaſters,

Although he hath Broken the Heads of his Masters,

'Tis ſtill his Profeſsion, to give 'em all Plaſters.

VVhich no body can deny.

Let em cry down the Pope, till their Throats are ſore,

Their deſign was to bring him in at the Back-door:

For the Rump ha's a mind to the ſcarlet whore.

VVhich no body can deny.

And this is a Truth at all hands confeſt,

However unskilfull in any of the reſt,

The Rump ſpeaks the Language of the Beaſt.

Which no body can deny.

They talk that Lambert is like to be try'd

For Treaſon, and Buggerie beſide,

Becauſe that he did the Rump beſtride.

VVhich no body can deny.

The Rump's an old ſtorie, if well underſtood

'Tis a thing dreſs'd up in a Parliaments Hood,

And like't, but the Tayl ſtands where the Heads ſhould.

Which no body can deny.

'Twould make a man ſcratch, where it does not itch,

To ſee forty Fools Heads in one Politique Breech,

And That,—Hugging the Nation as the Devil did the witch.

VVhich no body can deny.

From rotten Members preſerve our VVives:

From the mercie of a Rump, our Eſtates and our Lives:

For they must needs go, whom the Devil Drives.

VVhich no bodie can deny.

FINIS.
