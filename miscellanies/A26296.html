That the Exploits of Captain <span class="hi">Sharp,</span> and others in the South Sea, in ser­vice of the Emperour of <span class="hi">Darien,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e286"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> being the first that came to my Hands, at the time the late History of Buc­canieres was published; and I find­ing it to be a plain Journal, not unpleasant, and much of the same kind, writ by a Seaman, though not learned and accurate in his stile; yet one that certainly was very skilful and industrious in the Art of Sailing, who seems to have given a true and just Relation of what befel them in that Expedition: most of which I have heard confirmed by others, who were actually present in all those Adven­tures: For that reason I thought it might not be unacceptable to the world. To which I have only this to add, That this Emperor of <span class="hi">Darien</span> had been formerly surprized by the <span class="hi">Spaniards,</span> and by them carried to <span class="hi">Panama,</span> where he learnt indiffe­rently the <span class="hi">Spanish</span> Language, and was called by them <span class="hi">Sennordon An­dreas:</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e314"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> But he, after his escape, for their kind treatment of him, has never ceased making War upon them, always falling on whereever he sees any good opportunity; and when like to be overpowered, he retreats amongst his Hills, Woods, and Rivers, with which last his Countrey is very well stored, and so baffles the industrious revenge of his Enemies. The exact limits of that which is properly called the Province or District of <span class="hi">Darien</span> (which our Author has omitted to give us) are thus described.</p><p>It is bounded on the South by the Kingdom of <span class="hi">New Granada;</span> by the Gulf of <span class="hi">Uraba</span> or <span class="hi">Darien</span> on the East; by the South Sea on the West; and on the North by the Province of <span class="hi">Panama;</span> to which Government this is now annexed, I mean, so much as the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> have of it. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e338"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> It took its name from the River so called, running into the South Sea, and has a small Town, though once a great City, called <span class="hi">Santa Maria del Da­rien,</span> but more commonly, <span class="hi">Santa Maria</span> only, and sometimes <span class="hi">la An­tigua,</span> signifying the Ancient Ci­ty.</p><p>The next thing which is a short Account of <span class="hi">Van Horns</span> taking <span class="hi">la Vera Cruz,</span> being more Modern, and of the same nature, I added; to­gether with the destroying the <span class="hi">French</span> Pyrates by Captain <span class="hi">Carlisle,</span> that it may be seen what care is taken to suppress such as molest so considerable a support of our Nation, as is our Trade and Commerce with Foreign Countries; of which that with <span class="hi">Spain</span> is not the least: for by it more of our Manufactures are taken off, than by any other whatsoever. Besides <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e375"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> this of Captain <span class="hi">Carlisle</span>'s, if I had the leasure, I could have given an account of several others, both Men of War, and Merchant-Ships, fit­ted and manned out as such, by the Goverours of <span class="hi">Jamaica, Barbados,</span> and the <span class="hi">Leeward Islands,</span> on pur­pose for scouring the Seas of the Buccanieres or Pyrates, who being a mixture of divers Nations, but the greatest part of them <span class="hi">French</span> and <span class="hi">Dutch,</span> make Prize of all they meet.</p><p>The third Relation is of Sir <span class="hi">Hen­ry Morgan,</span> which according to me­thod ought to have been placed first, but I had no intentions of printing that, till I had read over and considered the said History of Buccanieres, and then thought my self obliged no lon­ger to conceal such an Authentick ac­count of that Expedition: To which <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e410"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> I have adjoyned the President of <span class="hi">Panama</span>'s Letter, which was inter­cepted, going for <span class="hi">Spain,</span> and con­firms (if need were) the Credit of the precedent Relation.</p><p>As to the last Paper, in which is mentioned the settling the Peace in those parts, with a Description of the City of <span class="hi">Carthagena;</span> since it related somewhat to the foregoing Pieces, I thought it not improper, with it to conclude these Miscella­nies.</p><p>But I confess, I had yet another design in printing that one Expediti­on of Sir <span class="hi">Henry Morgan,</span> which was, That I might in some measure rescue the Honour of that incom­parable Souldier and Seaman, from the Hands of such as would load him with the blackest infamy. I could not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e439"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> therefore forbear making some few re­flections on the aforementioned Hi­story of Buccanieres, but more especially that part which concerns Sir <span class="hi">Henry Morgan</span> and the <span class="hi">Eng­lish.</span> For it is against them, the Authors Malice seems most to be aim­ed, endeavouring on all occasions to represent them the most Lewd, Perfi­dious, and Barbarous People in the World.</p><p>And whereas the Translator, who, I confess, seems to have performed his part well enough, in having ren­dered it from the <span class="hi">Spanish</span> Trans­lation, does in his Encomiums of the Author, comparing him to the ad­mirable Historian <span class="hi">Comines,</span> very much extoll his Candour, and fide­lity, in recording the Actions and Valour of the <span class="hi">English;</span> then at large he commends his Stile and Me­thod; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e480"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> and highly applauds the Truth and Sincerity of his Histo­ry.</p><p>I will not trouble my self to shew the inequality of the Parallel, with the incomparable <span class="hi">Comines:</span> And as for his faithful recording their Actions, and Valour, I must al­low him to have writ some of their heroick Exploits well enough, which of themselves were so Eminent, that had he gone about to have les­sened, it would have taken away all credit from his History: But he has most maliciously stigmatized them all the while, as valiant Thieves and Murderers. So that there is no Man that reads them, who does not conceive a horrour a­gainst the barbarous Actors of those Cruelties.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e498"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> Neither will I find fault with the Authors Stile, and Method; But it is chiefly the boasted Truth and sin­cerity of the History which I am most concerned to expose, being therein able to detect innumerable Falsities; and for Vouchers of what I affirm, can produce a whole Cloud of Wit­nesses; many of which Romances are so palpable, that the Author could not possibly write them by mistake, but has inserted them on purpose, certainly as embellishments to set off his Story.</p><p>To begin then with Sir <span class="hi">Henry Mor­gan</span>'s Parentage; He makes him the Son of a Yeoman, and that be sold himself for <span class="hi">Barbados;</span> when it is sufficiently known he was de­scended of an honourable Family in <span class="hi">Monmouthshire,</span> and went at first <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e519"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> out of <span class="hi">England,</span> with the Army commanded by General <span class="hi">Venables</span> for <span class="hi">Hispaniola</span> and <span class="hi">Jamaica.</span></p><p>Then his cruel usage of the <span class="hi">Spani­ards</span> at <span class="hi">Puerto Velo, Maracàibo, Gibraltàr</span> and <span class="hi">Panamà,</span> Murdering many in cold blood; Racking and torturing some to confess where their Treasure lay, till they dyed; Star­ving others in Prison; Ravishing Women, and the like barbarities; which this <span class="hi">Dutch Comines</span> affirms he saw him not only suffer his Men daily to commit, but acted himself as their example. All those Cru­elties, contrary to the nature and temper of an <span class="hi">Englishman,</span> I have heard absolutely contradicted by per­sons of infallible credit; and any may be convinced of the fouluess of the Scandal thrown on this Excellent Man, who are but acquainted with <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e560"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> such as then lived in <span class="hi">Jamaica,</span> ma­ny of whom are now living in <span class="hi">Lon­don.</span> Nay the <span class="hi">English</span> Merchants of <span class="hi">Cadiz,</span> who resided ther<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> at the time these <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> of <span class="hi">Panama</span> returned from the <span class="hi">Indies,</span> affirm, that those very persons confessed, Sir <span class="hi">Hen­ry Morgan</span> was so far from doing any such base Actions, That they highly applauded his Generosity, and the Care he took, That none of those severe things should be practised by his Men, as are usual by a Con­querour, when he has his Enemies at his mercy, after an obstinate resi­stance. This makes me think that our <span class="hi">Dutch</span> Author, having the Idea of the Business of <span class="hi">Amboina</span> in his Head, has endeavoured to copy out that, and lay it on the <span class="hi">Eng­lish,</span> to render them as infamous to Posterity, for these supposed villa­nies in the <span class="hi">West-Indies,</span> as some of his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e619"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> Countreymen have by their real ones in the <span class="hi">East.</span></p><p>I am also assured by good Au­thority, That the Tale of Sir <span class="hi">Hen­ry Morgan</span> his ill usage of the <span class="hi">Spanish</span> Lady at <span class="hi">Panama,</span> is al­together a Romance; for so careful was he, that as soon as he had ta­ken the Town, and quenched the fire, he caused most of the Women of the City to be brought to one place, where he set a strict guard over them, to prevent the Souldiers, or any others abusing them, and gave out his Or­ders, prohibiting all men the offering them the least violence or injury, on pain of a severe punishment. And under what loose government soe­ver his men are represented to have lived; I affirm, That few Generals have kept their Armies with a more strict Discipline, than he. Nor can I think <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e648"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> it possible for him to have done all those great Actions with Men of so base and dissolute tempers, as our <span class="hi">Dutch</span> Hi­storian paints them to be: But, <span class="hi">Pien­sa el Ladron, quetodos son de su Condicion.</span></p><p>And for confirmation of what I have now asserted; At his return from <span class="hi">Pa­nama,</span> when he brought the Priso­ners to <span class="hi">la Cruz,</span> in his way to <span class="hi">Chagre</span> Castle, to induce them to pay their Ransomes; the Women, espe­cially such as seemed to be of any qua­lity, and could ride, were set on Horses, Mules, or Asses, and had Men appoin­ted to attend them with all respect. And our <span class="hi">Dutch Mandevil</span> says that such as were not able to redeem themselves, were transported; which is of equal cre­dit with the rest of his villanous Tales. For I am assured that no one person, Man, Woman or Child (the Slaves <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e688"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> only excepted) were so much as ever carried a shipboard, but were acquit­ted and set at liberty, when he embar­ked.</p><p>Moreover this Celebrated Buccanier Historian, relating these Acts of Ho­stility done in the <span class="hi">Indies</span> against the <span class="hi">Spaniards,</span> insinuates all along, That these were all Robberies and savage Butcheries, committed by Sir <span class="hi">Henry Morgan</span> and the rest of his Crew, who were a parcel of Thieves, Mur­therers and Pyrates; Men who did all this for the sake of Plunder, Blood-shed, and Rapine, without any other colour or pretext whatsoever; filling the World with horrour and amazement at the reading his terrible Stories: So that out of Malice, or at best, Igno­rance, he omits to tell us, That though we had not formally a War proclaimed against the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> there in the <span class="hi">In­dies,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e721"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> yet would not they listen to any proposals of Peace with us, beyond the Tropick, till about the year 1670. that it had been concluded in Ma­drid by Sir <span class="hi">William Godolphin</span> his Majesties Ambassador there, and the Articles sent over from hence by Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Linch</span> to <span class="hi">Jamaica;</span> before which time, there daily happened great Acts of Hostility and Depredations on either side, done as well by the <span class="hi">Spa­niards</span> against us, as by the <span class="hi">English</span> against them; and <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o doubt but Revenge spurred on many that had been sufferers, to the committing some severe things, and to heightening the Rage on both sides. For the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> all this while were <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ot idle, they took our Merchants ships; Plundred and spoiled our Plantations, particularly at <span class="hi">Jamaica;</span> Used our Men with all the severity and rigour, that an enemy could do, throwing them over board, exposing them in Boats, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e758"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> and on Rafts, without Provision, to the mercy of the Sea; Turning them on uninhabited Islands; Leaving them on Countreys to be destroyed by the <span class="hi">Indi­ans,</span> keeping and starving them in Dungeo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s, and making slaves of them. All which severities might well incense such as out-lived these miseries, if they ever escaped, to put in practice all manner of Revenge.</p><p>Now if I have rightly stated this point, then neither Sir <span class="hi">Henry Mor­gan,</span> nor any that fought under him, can be said to be Pyrates or Buccanieres; <span class="hi">I</span> mean, if he acted by Commission from Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Muddiford,</span> or any Governour of <span class="hi">Jamaica</span> before him; as, if I mistake not, I have heard he really did; which if true, though done without the Kings allowance or knowledge, I presume it justifies him, though not the Governour; So that any <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e785"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> Fleet, might in time of War as well be called Pyrates; and an Historian de­scribing the miseries attending a War between two Princes, might term the men slain in Battle, to be murdered; and the Calamities befalling a Town taken by storm, to be cruelties exer­cised by Thieves and Robbers, for the sake of Plunder, and satiating their thirst after Blood.</p><p>I would not have any judge me so vain, to think my self able to vin­dicate these men from every ill Acti­on, and imagine I could make them pass for Saints: But I still affirm, that those dismal Stories of Murdering in cold Blood, Torturing, Ravishing, Starving, and other such Barbarities, are foisted in by the Author, to lard his History with delightful variety, and to fix an odium on the English Nation in general, that they may be <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e798"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> hated by others. And I further say, That perchance never Man behaved himself with more true valour and re­solution of mind to accomplish what he had undertaken, shewed more prudent and soldierly Conduct, nor took more care for preventing all ir­regularities amongst his Men, by his own example, than the renowned Sir <span class="hi">Henry Morgan,</span> who has been thus scandalously affronted by these Sourrilous Pens: For I cannot call otherwise either the <span class="hi">Dutch</span> Author, or <span class="hi">Spanish</span> and <span class="hi">English</span> Transla­tors. Since there is no doubt but that if he had been the Pyrate, and ill Man, he is by them painted out to be; he would have been punished as such a one, instead of being ho­noured with a Knighthood, as he was at his coming home to <span class="hi">Eng­land:</span> and since that made Deputy<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Governour of <span class="hi">Jamaica,</span> under the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e834"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> Right Honourable the Earl of <span class="hi">Car­lisle,</span> and Lieutenant-General of the said Island.</p><p>There is one absurd story more, amongst many others, which I had like to have passed over without re­mark; that is, His firing the Ci­ty of <span class="hi">Panama</span> just at his entring in to it, as this <span class="hi">French-Hollander</span> affirms; which if he did, it was but ill Policy, to burn the Town he came so far to plunder, 'ere he was well got within it. But this is own­ed by the President, in his Letter, to have been done by the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> themselves, on purpose to disappoint the <span class="hi">English</span> of their Booty. By this ridiculous falsity, may the Credit of the rest of that History be conje­ctured.</p><p>Many errours could I point out in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e866"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> that which is his <span class="hi">Natural History of the</span> Indies; as for instance, his Story of seeing the Caymanes or Co­codrills suffer their young ones to play and run into their Bellies; for which Fancy he must have been, I suppose, obliged to <span class="hi">Pliny</span> or <span class="hi">Aelian;</span> for I dare say, no Man that has lived in the <span class="hi">Indies</span> will vouch for him. But these being besides my business, I pass by: and have only this more to say, That I forbear to print any more, at present, than that one Expedition of Sir <span class="hi">Henry Morgan,</span> thinking that sufficient to convince the Falsities of that scandalous History of Buccanieres.</p><p>What acts of Hostility have been committed since the Peace made in the year 1670. betwixt the <span class="hi">Spa­niards,</span> and the Privatiers of seve­ral Nations; have been many and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e895"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> considerable, amongst which we have had no small loss fallen on our Merchant men, trading there in the <span class="hi">West-in­dies,</span> causing a great obstruction to our Trade.

These Inhabi­tants are very handsome people though Tawny, but clean limbed and well fea­tured, and are very obliging and affable, as those of our Men who afterwards marcht back again, over Land, experienced.</p><p><span class="hi">8.

About four in the afternoon we arrived at the ap­pointed place, but not finding our fel­low Souldiers there, who embarked the day before us, as we expected, it crea­ted in us a jealousie that the Indians had thus divided us, the better to execute some treachery, by the assistance of the Spaniard, the Emperor perceiving by our Caballing and Whispering among our selves, that we had some cause of dissatisfaction, Commanded a Canoe to row up another arm of the River in search of our Men, and meeting two Canoes with some of them, they re­turned with all expedition to us, and in­formed us of their safety, and that they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1205"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=17">[Page 8]</a></span> had been honourably treated by the In­dians, and would be with us the next morning; so here we staid for them this night.</p><p><span class="hi">13.

This Fort of <span class="hi">Santa Maria</span> was kept by the Spaniards for the conveniency of gathering Dust-Gold, which the River affords plenty of, and the poor Natives are the Drudges to gather it for them. We designed to make no further pro­gress, being told there was a sufficient quantity of Gold-dust at this place to enrich us all, but the wary Spaniards had carried it away two days before, as thinking a conveyance of their own con­triving safer than ours, though not so well guarded as it would have been by us.</p><p><span class="hi">17.

At this place it flows near two fathom perpendicular. The River is else very showly and full of Banks, which are dry at low Water. A­bout twelve in the night we came to a Watering place, where we got drink, the River being Salt, here we staid till morn­ing filling Water, it being very dark, and the mouth of the River wide, one branch of it coming from the Golden Mines; but having no Chymist to re­fine the Ore, we thought it best to go look for it where it was to be had with the King of <span class="hi">Spains</span> Arms on it, for we like other Children loved Pictures strangely.</p><p><span class="hi">18.

It being a certain truth that those who are born to be hang'd shall never be drown'd, it proving so with us, one of our Com­pany being hang'd at <span class="hi">Iamaica</span> on <span class="hi">Port Royal;</span> And we were very near it here in <span class="hi">London;</span> After this having a violent storm of rain we were forced on shoar upon a long sandy bank, where we built a House and were content to Lodg in it this night.</p><p><span class="hi">20.

Towards noon it be­gan to blow hard, yet nothing is diffi­cult to a willing mind, so we proceed­ed; About two in the after noon we put ashoar at an Isle to look some Water to drink, and finding some in the stinking holes of the Rocks we drank it as hearti­ly as Canary. This Island is high, round, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1317"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=19">[Page 12]</a></span> and Rocky, and here is plenty of Sea-Fowl; we staid not long here, but about four of the Clock we came to <span class="hi">Planting Isle,</span> where finding a Bark, and we stand­ing in need of Shipping, put some of our Men on board here; At this place we took Quarters for this night; There was on board the Bark 130.

Having no Provisions, and perceiving we should be continually Skirmishing, we went on shoar at this Island, and lay there that night</p><p><span class="hi">22.

Men in her, whom we had sent to look some Water for us, where they could find it, early in the morn­ing; And soon after we met with three Armadillo Barks with 280 Men on board them, which engaged our Fleet of Ca­noes, having in all scarce above 200 found Men in them. These three Barks were fitted out of <span class="hi">Panama,</span> who by this had notice from <span class="hi">Santa Maria</span> of our approach, on purpose to cut us off, thus unprovided of Shipping, or convenience of defence, being in Canoes that carried some six, some eight and ten, to fifteen Men, which leaning on one side might overset the biggest; however nothing daunted at the disadvantage of Fight, we made a resolution rather than drown in the Sea, or beg Quarter of the Spaniard, whom we used to Conquer, to run the ex­treamest hazard of Fire and Sword, and after a sharp Contest, still birding with our Fusees as many as durst peep over Deck, we boarded one of them, and car­ried her; so with her we took the second; and the third had certainly run the same <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1366"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=20">[Page 14]</a></span> fate, had not she scoured away in time, (though to speak without diminution of the Commanders courage) he staid as long as he could, and we plyed him very warmly, so that though we know not certainly how many Men they lost on board, yet are confident but few found Men returned to their City.</p><p>In this engagement we had eleven Men Killed right out, and thirty four more Wounded dangerously.</p><p>These Vessels being purposely fitted out for this design, afforded but small conveniency for our Wounded Men; so we went in chase of a larger Ship which we soon after took, put our Wounded Men on board her, and lay before the City of <span class="hi">Panama,</span> as well to refresh our tired Men, as to show them, they were not like to be rid of us so.</p><p><span class="hi">25.

The Canoes wherein were thirty five Men out-rowed the Boat, and Landed before day, and just upon day light they dis­cerned the Patroule, which is kept on <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2699"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=33">[Page 40]</a></span> the Bay; and at this time did consist of about 150 Horse, who deriving Cou­rage from their advantage in numbers, hemmed us in a ring, not doubting but to have an easie conquest over so few Men, and rid boldly up to us; our Com­mander considering we were but thirty five, ordered that but six Men should Fire at once on the Enemy, to keep the longer from a close Fight; being provided of no other Arms then a Fuzee and a Pistol, as also knowing our Party would in a little time come up to our res­cue, but whether they did or no, this was our resolution, to turn our backs on the water-side and every Man maintain his ground, or fall upon the spot he stood on. By this time they were come pretty near, and I believe scarce a shot flew in vain, and so quick, having Cartridges alway fitted for our small Arms, that scarce two Vollies were fired before those that had discharged were ready loaded for them a­gain, that he was happiest amongst them that got furthest behind; thus we bat­tered them severely, which they, after they had made a stand to carry off their dead, not liking, retreated in disorder, do­ing no other damage then the Wounding <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2714"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=33">[Page 41]</a></span> one Man. We followed the chase, though but leisurely, that our Men who had been set on shoar by the Boat, might come up with us, which in a little time they did, following us, by the track of our Feet and tops of the Cartridges, coming with full speed to our Assistance if there had been occasion; Then we followed the Enemy as close as we could, think­ing they had retreated into the Town, but they decoyed us (to give the peo­ple time to secure their Valuable Com­modities) a contrary way, and led us a­mongst Ditches and watry Swamps; yet at last we got to the Town, and in a short time made our selves Masters of it, with little or no loss on our side. Here we staid four days to refresh our selves, finding plenty of Hogs, Fowls, Mutton, and Sallads, with very good Wine, which is made here, also great store of Wheat, Barly, and all <span class="hi">European</span> Grain, and many large Orchards as they have in <span class="hi">Kent,</span> of Apples, Pears, Cher­ries, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> Likewise delicate Gardens of Apricocks, Peaches, Strawberries, Goose­berries, and other Fruit.</p><p>The Town of <span class="hi">Coquimbo,</span> Scituate upon a Hill, is three quarters of a mile square, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2743"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=34">[Page 42]</a></span> and has nine good Churches in it;<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note15">An.

The chief Manu­facture of the place is Copper, which they have in abundance.</p><p>Here is also Gold-dust, which washes out of a great River that runs into the Sea, at the foot of the Hill whereon the Town stands, the latitude of the place is 29 deg. 50 min. South.</p><p>The second day that we were in the Town, there came six Gentlemen to us, with a Flag of Truce, desiring that we would send their Governour some Wine, for he had none in the Fields where he lay, which we did, together with some Fowls. And this Compliment; That if either Himself or his Lady wanted any thing that they had left behind them, Gold, Silver, and Jewels excepted, they might with freedom command it. Af­ter this, finding we were such so­ciable Enemies, and so good Natured Victors, he Invited our Captain to drink a glass of Wine with him at the top of a Hill just by the Town side, and de­sired our Captain to come without Arms, and but with one Man, and he would do the same, which our Commander <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2760"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=34">[Page 43]</a></span> consented to, and met the Governour with two Bottles of VVine,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note16">An.

Our Comman­der agreeing with the Governour, who was unwilling the Town should be de­molished, to Ransom it for 95000 pieces of <span class="hi">Eight,</span> which he promised to send us the next day.</p><p>So having drank their VVine, they parted; we receiving the Captain into the Town with a Volly of small Arms.</p><p>The next day our fancies being filled with the expectation of so much money, we were at a pitch of mirth higher then ordinary, when we received a Letter from on board our Ship, intimating that there was an Indian with a couple of Seal Skins blown like Bladers, of which he made a float, and in the dead of the night came under the Stern of our Ship, with a Ball of Pitch, Sulphur, Oakum, and such combustible matter, and stuck it between the Rudd<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>r and Stern-port, and set it on fire with a Brimstone match, after this he left his new Fashioned Boat and swome on shoar. This fire made such a stench that almost choaked the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2783"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=35">[Page 44]</a></span> Men in the Ship, who else, it is possi­ble, had not awaked, for had they kept a good look out, the Indian could not have effected so great a part of his de­sign, some leaped into their Canoes and others searched within board, and at last found the fire before it had taken hold of the Ship. This piece of Trea­chery made us despair of our money; However it wrought this effect upon us, that ever after, we kept so strict a watch, that we had prevented any such other mischiefs, had they attempted the like against us. And truly as our cir­cumstances were, it was a deliverance, no Serious Man will be ever unmindful to give God Thanks for. For at that time, had our Ship been burnt, not one man of us had escaped, the Spaniards being not easily reconciled to us, for those ill Offices we had done them since our visits there on the South Sea Coasts, and some of us also not unknown to them in the North Seas; That they would have hanged the rest if they had been Saints.</p><p>The Spaniards perceiving their pro­ject had not operated to burn our Ship, they Early in the morning tur­ned <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2800"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=35">[Page 45]</a></span> all the water sluices into the Town, which in an hours time, made the streets almost Ankle deep in water, which before was dry dust. This they did, either to drive us out of the Town, or to have water at hand to quench it, in case we set it on fire, which (resolving to keep our word with the Enemy) we did, firing it in se­veral Places at once, and Packing up our Luggage, after we had staid till the greatest part of it was in Flames, we marched out of it down to the water side; But the Governour had drawn all his men from the tops of the Hills, down into the Vally, by the water side into the way that we should pass; So we detached out a small party for a forlorn, supposing we must have fought our way through; But as soon as we began to pink some of their Jackets for them with our Fu­zees, they got out of our reach, and went to their ruin'd Town leaving us to go peaceably on Board our Ship. When we came on Board, we sent a shoar a great number of our Prisoners, and amongst the rest <span class="hi">Don Thomas d'Al­gondony,</span> Captain <span class="hi">Peralta,</span> Captain <span class="hi">Don Iuan,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2818"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=36">[Page 46]</a></span> and many others, some of them being Merchants, which we had taken and kept on board, to learn them to eat <span class="hi">Montego</span> and <span class="hi">Do<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eboys.</span> Yet had they no reason to complain of their entertainment amongst us, they being very civilly treated with the best our Ship could afford, which if they do not justly acknowledge, let them have a care we call them not to an account for their ingratitude, when they least think of it.</p><p>7. <span class="hi">Tuesd.</span> This day we weighed from <span class="hi">Coguimbo,</span> wind at South.</p><p>8. <span class="hi">Wedn.</span> Little wind at South, we stood to the Westward, and made three Islands that Lye North West, a little distance from the <span class="hi">Harbour</span> of <span class="hi">Coquimbo.</span></p><p>9. <span class="hi">Thursd.</span> At 12 a Clock the Souther­most Isle bore West 12 leag. distance.</p><p>10. <span class="hi">Frid.</span> Very little wind at South we have run 2 leag.

Mean while the Enemy being drawn up in an ad­vantagious place, still kept their sta­tion, nor would at all move, though often provoked by us, fearing to lose the security of their Ground. Which our Admiral perceiving, pre­sently gave order, That our Officers should wheel our Body to the left, and endeavour to gain a Hill which was hard by, and which if once gain­ed, we should then force the Enemy to engage, to their great disadvan­tage; because he could not be able to bring out of his great Body, any more Men to fight at a time, than we should out of our small; and that we should likewise have the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8763"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=82">[Page 138]</a></span> advantage, both of the Wind and Sun.</p><p>Our Officers streight put this com­mand in execution, and in a small time we gained the Hill, together with a little dry Passage, of con­venience for us. So the Enemy was constrained to fight us upon their hasty march, not having room enough to wheel their whole Body, by reason of a great Bogg, which was just at their Rear, and before which they had purposely drawn up, to en­trap us: But we having thus Chan­ged our Ground, that proved in the upshot to be of prejudice to them­selves.</p><p>We being thus advanced, <span class="hi">Don Francisco de Haro,</span> who commanded their Cavalry, with his Horse gave the first Charge to our Vanguard, which he did very furiously, coming up­on the full speed; and we having no Pikes among us, our Admiral gave order, That we should double our Ranks to the Right, and close the Files to the Right and Left inward, to the close Order: But their fiery Com­mander <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8786"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=82">[Page 139]</a></span> could not stop his career till he dropt, losing his life in the Front­Rank of our Vanguard.</p><p>Upon this their Horse wheeled off to the Right, and their Foot ad­vanced to try their Fortunes, but they proved as unsuccessful as their fel­lows; for we being ready, with our main Body to receive them, with our first Volley gave them such a warm welcome, and pursued our work in hand, with that vigour and briskness, that our friends the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> thought it safest to retreat, and by and by were so closely ply­ed by our Left Wing also, who at first could not come to engage, (because of their hindrance by the Hills) which our Enemies not able to en­dure, mended, though unwilling­ly, their pace, and at last all in ge­neral betook themselves to plain run­ning.</p><p>Just before which, they practi­sed such a stratagem, as hath sel­dom been heard. For while the Foot had engaged us in the Front and the Flanks, they had contrived to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8816"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=83">[Page 140]</a></span> force in, two great Droves of Oxen, of above a thousand in each, into the Right and Left Angles of our Rear, with intention to break and disorder us: Which design might probably have taken effect, had not our prudent Admiral, with great presence of mind, spoiled their pro­ject, giving order to a small Party to fire at the Drivers, and not at the Cattle, which put the rest into so great a fear, that the Oxen were soon forced back with <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>afe. So that this stratagem being thus defeated, they were in so great consternation, that happy was he that could get first into the City: There they had two hundred fresh men, and two Forts; in the one were fix Brass Guns mounted, and in the other eight. They had all their Streets barricadoed, and in many of them had also planted great Guns; the number of which amounted in all to thirty two Brass Guns: But instead of fighting after all this pre­paration, the President caused the City to be fired, and his chiefest <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8827"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=83">[Page 141]</a></span> Fort to be blown up, which was done with such hast, that he blew up forty of his Souldiers in it. We followed them into the Town, where in the <span class="hi">Placa Mayor,</span> or chief Mar­ket place, they made a short re­sistence, fring some of their great Guns at us, with which they killed us four Men, and wounded five.</p><p>At three a Clock in the After­noon, we had quiet possession of the City, although in Flames, with no more loss on our side in this days work, than five Men killed, and ten wounded; but of the Enemy about four hundred. And now were we forced to put all Hands to work for the quenching the Fire of our Ene­mies Houses, which they themselves had kindled to disappoint us of the Plunder; but all our labour was in vain, for by twelve a clock at Night, all the whole City was burnt, ex­cept a part of the Suburbs, which with our great industry, we made a shift to save, being two Churches, and about three hundred Houses.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8846"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=84">[Page 142]</a></span> Thus was that ancient and famous City of <span class="hi">Panama</span> consumed and laid in Ashes; being the greatest Mart for Silver and Gold in the whole World: for it receives all the Goods and Mer­chandise coming from <span class="hi">Old Spain,</span> in the Kings great Fleet, which is first landed at <span class="hi">Puerto Belo</span> and <span class="hi">Venta Cruz,</span> and thence brought on Mules, and by other land-Carriage, hither; and likewise delivers to the Gallions of the Flota or Plate Fleet, all the Silver and Gold which comes from the Mines of <span class="hi">Potozi,</span> and all <span class="hi">Peru.</span></p><p>Here at this City we stayed eight and twenty days, making continual incursions upon the Enemy by Land, for twenty Leagues round about, with­out having so much as one Gun shot at us in anger, although we took in this time near three thousand Priso­ners of all sorts: And kept Barks like­wise cruising in the South Sea, and fetching off Prisoner from <span class="hi">Toboga</span> and other Islands near that Coast, to which the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> had fled with their Families.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8886"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=84">[Page 143]</a></span> <span class="hi">February</span> the fourteenth,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note44">1670.

And from that place I ordered another Party with two o­ther Guns, of the Men which came from the River, being above three hundred, to advance towards the Enemy, which neither did any good.</p><p>This Body of Men which I had thus brought with me, was compounded of two sorts, Valiant Military Men, and faint hearted Cowards, many of them ha­ving all their Estates, or pay due to them, left in the Castle of <span class="hi">Chagre,</span> and <span class="hi">Puerto Velo,</span> and a great part of my Men were <span class="hi">Negroes, Nulattos</span> and <span class="hi">Indians,</span> to the number of about twelve hundred, be­sides two hundred <span class="hi">Negroes</span> more belong­ing to the <span class="hi">Astiento.</span> Our Fire Arms were <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9303"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=89">[Page 153]</a></span> few and bad, in comparison of those the Enemy brought: For ours were Carbins, Harquebusles and Fowling pieces, but few Muskets for they had likewise been left in <span class="hi">Puerto Velo</span> and <span class="hi">Chagre.</span></p><p>Now having formed the Army, into two double Squadrons, and the Caval­ry which were two hundred, mounted on the same tired Horses which had brought them thither, and with two great Herds of Oxen and Bulls, drove thither by fifty Cow-keepers on purpose to disorder the Enemy. The Army all appeared brisk and courageous, desire­ing nothing more than to engage; nor wanted there any thing of <span class="hi">Regalo</span> to infuse Spirit into them. So that it seemed to me, by what I saw, and what they told me, that they would be able to charge the Enemy like Lightning.</p><p>On <span class="hi">Wednesday</span> morning, the Enemy appeared, seeming to direct their march towards our Rear in three Squadrons, wherein they had two thousand three hundred Men, as I understood for certain afterwards, but by and by they taking a compass, advanced to the Front of our <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9326"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=90">[Page 154]</a></span> Army. I had put for Leader of our left Wing <span class="hi">Dom Alonso Alcaudete,</span> and for Leader of the right Wing the Governour of <span class="hi">Be­ragues, Don Iuan Portando Bargueno,</span> and in the centre the Serjeant Major; To these I gave strict Command that none should move without my order, and that com­ing within shot, the three first Ranks should Fire on their Knees, and after this charge, they should give place to the Rear to come up and Fire, and that although they should chance to see any fall Dead, or Wounded, they should not quit their stations, but to the last ex­tremity observe these their Orders.</p><p>I was at this time in the right Wing of the Vanguard, watching the Enemies motion, which was hasty, by the Foot of a Hill, in a narrow place, about three Musket shot from the left Wing of our Army. When on a sudden I heard a loud clamour, crying out, <span class="hi">Fall on, fall on; For they Fly. At which Don Alonso de Alcaudete,</span> was not able to keep them in their Ranks nor stop them from run­ning away, though he cut them with his Sword, but they all fell into disorder; And I well knowing the Fatality of this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9348"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=90">[Page 145]</a></span> gave command that they should drive in the Herds of Cattle, and charge with the Horse, So putting my self in the Head of the Squadron of the right Wing, saying, <span class="hi">come along Boys, there is no other remedy now, but to Conquer, or Die;</span> Follow me. I went directly to the Enemy, and hardly did our Men se<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> some fall Dead, and others Wounded, but they turned their backs, and fled; leaving me there with only one <span class="hi">Negro,</span> and one Servant that followed me. Yet I went forward to comply with my word to the Virgin, which was to Die in her Defence, receiving a shot in a staff which I carried in my Hand up­right close to my cheek. At which mo­ment came up to me a Priest of the great Church, called <span class="hi">Iuan de Dios</span> (who was wont to say Mass in my House) beseeching me to retire and save my self whom I twice sharply reprehended. But the third time, he persisting, telling me that it was meer desperation to Die on that manner, and not like a Christian. With that I retired, it being a miracle of the Virgin to bring me off safe from amidst so many thousand Bullets.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9370"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=91">[Page 156]</a></span> After this I endeavoured with all my industry to perswade the Souldiers to turn and face our Enemies, but it was impossible; so that nothing hindering them, they entred the City, to which the Slaves and Owners of the Houses had put Fire, and being all of Boards and Timber, 'twas most of it quickly burnt, except the <span class="hi">Audiencia,</span> the Gover­nours House, the Convent of the <span class="hi">Mer­cedes, San Ioseph,</span> the Suburbs of <span class="hi">Ma­lambo,</span> and <span class="hi">Pierde Vidas,</span> at which they say, the Enemy fretted very much for being disappointed of their Plunder.

Though in the main, they seemed suspicious, as doubting whether or no we intended to keep it strictly; And to strengthen it, soon af­ter Dinner, there came an Express to the Governour, from the wind-ward, giving him an account, that there were two Privateers come to an <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, near <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> de Canu,</span> which is about five leagues <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9873"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=97">[Page 168]</a></span> from the City. At which they seemed infinitely dissatisfied, and confidently affirmed they must needs be <span class="hi">English,</span> and told us with all that there was but small likelihood the Peace should be long continued, when our Privateers came before the Town, whilst we were there treating with them, and owning the Peace. To appease which, the Colo­nel, assured them, Sir <span class="hi">Thoms Linch</span> had called in all the Commissions, and that he was confident we had not on Privateer abroad. So that if there were any such Vessells out, they were <span class="hi">French</span> of <span class="hi">Tor­tuga;</span> But for their better satisfaction, if the Governour desire it, he would send one of the Frigats to see what they were. Which offer he gladly accepted. And that he might see we intended no­thing more than the Preservation of the Peace, the Colonel sent Captain <span class="hi">Wil­gresse</span> to Sea, who returned again in twenty four hours, having been beyond the place, where they were reported to have been, but saw none, at which they were again satisfied.</p><p>The remainder of the time we staid here, which was whilst the Governours <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9902"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=97">[Page 169]</a></span> Papers were dispatching, we spent in view­ing the Town, and treating several Gen­tlemen of theirs a board, who were cu­rious to see the Frigats and their strength.</p><p>The City of <span class="hi">Carthagena</span> lies on a Bay by the Sea side, built on a Sand, but to Landward it is very boggy. It is in length about three quarters of a mile, and not full half a mile in bredath. `Tis walled all round with a thick stone wall of about four and twenty foot high, with Bastions built with Orillons, in some parts, in others they are plain: But has neither Graffs nor Ramparts. The Guns which are in number one hundred twenty six, are most Brass and Copper, and lie upon the Parapets, and looking over the tops of the walls, with­out either Battlements, or common Base­kets, to blind them. In the wall are three Gates; one to the South called <span class="hi">San Domingo;</span> one to the North East, called <span class="hi">Santa Catalina,</span> and one to the East, which goes to the Harbour, and into the Country. This City neverthe­less is not strong, for there is neither Castle, nor any considerable place of strength in it; and moreover to the North <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9928"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=98">[Page 170]</a></span> North West, which is the Bay, those winds have made in the wall three great Breaches, which may be entred with ease. The People likewise are not many be­sides Church Men, and for the most part are <span class="hi">Creolians</span> who are half <span class="hi">Spaniard</span> and half <span class="hi">Indian;</span> There are also many <span class="hi">Molatto's</span> and <span class="hi">Negroes</span> amongst them. Their Souldiers are Armed (for Fire Arms) only with match Locks, in the use of which they are likewise very un­expert.</p><p>The City in general is well built with Stone, and covered with Tile; the streets are narrow, and the Houses for the most part contiguous, and most of them four or five stories high, with Balconies of Wood and great Wooden Lattices as they have in <span class="hi">Spain.</span> Here are many Beauti­ful Churches, and other Publick Stru­ctures. One of their greatest wants is fresh water, having none but what falls from the Clouds, for the reception whereof, they have large Cisterns in most Houses and likewise under the Bastions in the walls, where they keep and husband it till God send a fresh sup­ply. The Town appears very Beauti­ful <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9964"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60800&amp;page=98">[Page 171]</a></span> at a distance, for there are many Cocao Nut Trees which resemble Palms, grow­ing promiscuously in several parts there­of, and overtopping the Houses; which is a delightful Ornament to it.</p><p>On the East side of it, about a mile distant, upon an Eminence stands a Castle called <span class="hi">Santa Madalena,</span> provided with many Guns of Brass, Copper and Iron, which they look upon, as of great strength, and able to do much in their defence, and for preservation of their City.</p><p>Whilst we staid here some of our Company were desirous to treat with one <span class="hi">Herman</span> an Eminent Factor here for the <span class="hi">Grillo's Genoese</span> Merchants in <span class="hi">Spain,</span> in hopes to have sold him some <span class="hi">Negroes</span> from <span class="hi">Iamaca,</span> but he was so ill beloved by the People, and they were so suspici­ous of us, left we should sell the <span class="hi">Negroes</span> which waited on us, that we could not have any discourse with him.</p><p>On <span class="hi">Friday</span> the twenty eighth.
