## 1\. Have among you good Women  
OR,

A High-way diſcourſe betweene old William Starket,

And Robin Hobs, going to Maydſtone market:

Good Women before hand let me you adviſe,

To keepe your owne counſell, and ſo be held wiſe.

If any one take in ill part what's here ſaid,

Sheel ſhew by her kicking that ſhee's a gauld jade.

To the tune of, O ſuch a Rogue.

GOd morrow old father Starket,

whither goe you with ſuch ſpéed,

Ime going to Maidſtone Market,

to buy ſuch things as I need:

I care not if I goe a long with you,

if you goe no faſter then I,

I am very glad that I ſpide you,

for I loue good company.

What thinke you of Alce that ſels butter,

her neighbors head clothes ſhe off pluckt,

And ſhe ſcolded from dinner to ſupper,

oh ſuch a ſcold would be cuckt.

There's many ſuch birds in our towne,

whoſe fury no reaſon can ſwage,

Ide giue very gladly a crowne,

to heare them all ſing in a Cage:

Poore men in ſubiection are held,

ſo are modeſt women likewiſe,

Vnleſſe their owne minde be fulfil'd,

they'll be ready to ſcratch out ones eies.

What thinke you of Ione the Spinner,

her husbands pocket ſhe pickt,

And ſhe grudges her ſeruants their dinner

oh ſuch a Queane would be kickt.

Nay kicking's too good for her,

her husband of her ſtands in awe,

Out of doores he dares not ſtirre,

for feare that he féele club law:

If he to the Ale-houſe ſteale,

ſhée'll goe as faſt or faſter,

And there ſhe will ring him a peale,

that is worſe then Lord or Maſter:

What thinke you of Ruth the Seamſtris,

her tongue can no way be reclam'd,

She rules o're poor Tom like an Empreſſe,

oh ſuch a proud wench would be tam'd.

Tis pitty that men are ſuch fooles,

to make themſelues ſlaues to their wiues,

For ſtill where the foot the head rules,

'tis wonder if any thing thriues:

That man that will be his wifes drudge,

of ſuch a conceat I am,

That if I might be his Iudge,

he ſhould eat none o'th roaſted Ram:

What thinke you of Ione that cries pins,

come eight rowes a penny cries ſhée,

She has broken her husbands ſhins,

and ſweares ſhée'll be drunke before hée.

Why, wherefore all this doth he ſuffer,

why if he ſhould giue her a check,

She tels her friends how he doth cuff her,

and threatens to break her neck:

So he for feare ſhée'll cry out,

dares neither to ſtrike nor chide her,

For ſhée'll giue the word all about,

that his Queans wil not let him abide her:

What thinke you of drunken Sue,

for drinke ſhe will ſell all her ſmocks,

I'th ſtréetes ſhe will raile and ſpew,

'tis fit ſhe were tam'd in the ſtocks.

### 1.1. The ſecond part,

To the ſame tune.

_[figure]_

_[figure]_

NAy ſometimes beſides her own getting,

ſhée'll pawne his ſhirt and his bréeches,

Which all ſhall be ſpent at a ſitting,

and thus ſhe increaſeth his riches:

What thinks her poore husband of that,

why, if he doe her reprehend,

His face She will ſcratch like a Cat,

and ſweares what ſhe gets ſhe will ſpend:

What thinke you of Peg the Pie-woman,

her Noſe hath béen cut and ſlaſht,

Shée's turnd now a dayes very common,

oh ſuch a Queane would be laſht.

Laſt Saturday noone at dinner,

ſome ſpoke about her I ſuppoſe,

How ſhe was found nought with a Ioyner,

whoſe wife came and cut her Noſe:

Indéed no body can blame her,

ſhe has giuen her a mark to be knowne,

And if all that will not ſhame her,

the Hangman has markt her for his own:

What thinke you of ſnuffelling Kate,

by her many women haue ſmarted,

She ſels Maidenheads at a rate,

oh ſuch a old Trot would be carted.

Such cunning old ſluts as ſhe,

indéed are the ruine of many,

Such faſt holding Lime-twigs they be,

that if they get hold of any,

There's no ſpéech at all of diſmiſſing,

whiles money their turne can ſerue,

Thus whiles he his Minion is kiſſing,

his poore wife and children may ſtarue:

What thinke you of Madge that cries wheat,

ſhe makes her poor husband ſhed teares,

She vſeth to cozen and cheat,

but the Pillory gapes for her eares.

I heard lately how ſhe did deale,

with a Butcher a notable blade,

Whom ſhe guld of a quarter of Veale,

and thus ſhe ſet vp her trade:

Since that ſhe hath done many a ſleight,

as bad or rather worſe,

If you in her company light,

I wiſh you take héed of you purſe:

What thinke you of quarrelling Nan,

that will to no goodneſſe be turn'd,

She threatens to kill her good man,

oh ſuch a Queane would be burn'd.

I me ſorry to heare that newes,

when man and wife are at ſtrife:

Alas neighbour, how can you chuſe,

when a man goe in danger on's life.

Loe thus we haue talkt away time,

and nowe perforce muſt we part,

The Market is now in the prune,

then farewell with all my heart:

Commend me to Doll at the Crowne,

that meſſage muſt not be miſt,

Shée's the kindeſt Hoſtis in the towne,

oh ſuch a Laſſe would be kiſt.

But ſtay neighbour, harke you one word,

which I had forgotten before,

What heare you of little Kate Bird,

ſome ſay ſhe is turnd arrant whore:

Indéed neighbour I thought no leſſe,

ſince that with her I was acquainted,

A man can no otherwiſe gueſſe,

her face is moſt baſely painted:

She ledges with mouldy fact Nell,

and I doubt they will neuer be parted,

'Till the one get the laſh in Bridewell,

and the other from Newgate be carted.

M. P.

FINIS.
