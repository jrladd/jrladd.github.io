And in euerie true prayer, conuerſion or repentance vnto God is made or increaſeth. The fourth conſideration is of the promiſe<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note87">Promiſe to him that prai­eth.</span> of grace, and confidence of the Mediator, that wee may come vnto God according to the ſaying, <span class="hi">Epheſ. 3. 12. By him we dare boldly come by faith in him.</span> Needefull it is then that we firſt by faith receiue forgiuenes of ſins, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4629"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18503&amp;page=36">[Page 64]</a></span> or reconciliation, and beleeue that praier pleaſeth God, and is not fruſtrate. Furthermore alſo other promiſes touching other benefits and the mitigation of calamities, muſt be looked vppon, as is here ſaide, <span class="hi">Call vpon me in the day of tribulation, and I will deliuer thee.</span> The fift conſideration of faith, here we muſt knowe, that faith<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note88">Asking in faith: Beleeuing God.</span> which craueth forgiueneſſe, reconciliation, life euerlaſting, and gouernment of the ſoule, ought in forme to craue theſe ſelfe ſame benefites, and looke for them without conditi­on; becauſe God wil haue theſe to be craued for by name; and not to haue theſe gifts, is, to remaine an enemie of God, and to reproach God, or to iniure him according to the ſaying, <span class="hi">He that beleeueth not in the Sonne, the wrath of God remaineth vpon him.</span> Againe, he repro­ueth God of lying. But faith which craueth corporall good things, as <span class="hi">Dauid</span> crauing of God, that he might be brought againe into his kingdome, required it with a con­dition; <span class="hi">if it pleaſed God:</span> becauſe both things muſt be knowen of vs, that we muſt aſke theſe benefites, and yet, that the church muſt be ſubiect vnto the croſſe, and oweth obedience vnto God, according to the ſaying <span class="hi">1. Pet. 5. 6. Humble your ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God:</span> and yet the prayer is not fruſtrated: for either the puniſh­ment is taken quite away, or elſe mitigated. Finally, needefull it is, that we moſt firmely keepe this rule: yea euen when we haue loſt our corporall benefits, and when we muſt aſſuredly forgo the life of the body, yet muſt we needes retaine the promiſe of grace and life euerlaſting, like as <span class="hi">Iob</span> ſaith <span class="hi">cap. 13. 15. Yea thoug he ſhal kil me, yet will I truſt in him, and he ſhall be my Sauiour.</span> The fixt conſideration of things to be craued, is, as ſaint <span class="hi">Iohn</span> ſaith in his firſt epiſtle <span class="hi">ch. 5. 14, 15.

He doth not then giue ſucceſſe by and by, and by ſuch maner of meanes, as mans reaſon conceiueth: like as <span class="hi">Ioſeph, Ionas,</span> and very many others in all ages were deliuered, far otherwiſe than they themſelues could deuiſe.
