Where hee met with fifteen Forreſters all on a row,

With the general for to bine,

There was be ware of fiftéen Forreſters

And a drinking Bear, Ale and Wine,

Hey down, derry derry down,

What news, what news, ſaid bold Robin Hood;

What news fain wouldeſt thou know?

Our King hath provided a ſhooting match,

And I'm ready with my Bow,

Hey down derry derry down.

We hold it in ſcorn then ſaid the Forreſters,

Should bear a Bow before our King,

That's not able to draw one ſtring,

Hey, down, derry derry down,

And Ile cauſe a Hart to dye,

Thou hit'ſt not the marke a hundred rod

Nor cauſeſt a Hart to dye

And a broad arrow he let flye,

He hit the mark a hundred rod

And he cauſed a Hart to dy

Some ſaid he brake ribs one or two,

And ſome ſaid hee brake thrée,

The arrow within the Hart would not'abide,

But it glanced in two or three,

Hey down, derry derry down,

_[figure]_

THe Hart did skip, and the Hart did leap,

derry derry down,

And the Hart lay on the ground

The wager is mine ſaid bold Robin Hood,

If'twere for a thouſand pound,

Hey down, derry derry down.

The wager's none of thine then ſaid the For­reſters

Although thou beeſt in haſte,

Take up thy Bow and get thee hence

Leſt wee thy ſides do baſ [...]e,

Hey down, derry derry down,

And his broad arrows all amain,

And Robin Hood he laught and begun to ſmile

As hee went over the Plain,

Hey down, derry derry down.

Then Robin Hood hee bent his noble Bow

derry derry down,

And his broad arrows he let flye,

Till fourteen of theſe fifteen forreſters

Vpon the ground did lye

Hey down, derry derry down.

He that did this quarrel firſt begin,

derry derry down,

Went tripping over the Plain;

But Robin Hood he bent his noble Bow,

And hee  [...]etcht him back again,

Hey down derry, &c.

You ſaid I was no Archer ſaid Robin Hood,

derry derry down,

But ſay ſo now again,

With that he ſent another arrow

That ſplit his head in twain,

Hey down, derry, &c.

You have found mee an Archer ſaith Robin Hood

derry derry down,

Which will make your Wives for to wring

And wiſh that you had never ſpoke the word,

That I could not draw [...]ne ſtring,

Hey down, derry, &c.

The people that lived in fair Nottingham,

Came runing out amain

Suppoſing to have taken bold Robin Hood,

With the Forreſters that were  [...]lain,

Hey down, derry, &c.

Some loſt Legs, and ſome loſt Arms

And ſome did loſe their blood,

But Robin Hood hee took up his noble Bow

And is gone to the merry gréen Wood

hey down derry, &c.

They carryed theſe Forreſters into fair Not­tingham

derry derry down,

As many there did know

They dig'd them graves in their Church-yard

And they buried them all a row,

hey down, derry derry down.
