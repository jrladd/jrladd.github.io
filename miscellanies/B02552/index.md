WHere's my Shepherd (my love) hey-ho,

On yonder Mountain amidſt the Snow;

I dearly love him I vow, and now,

will follow, and merrily to him go:

My young Shepherd has Beauty and Charms

And I long to find him in my arms,

I long for Night, to Embrace him a Bed,

And I long to give him my Maiden-head.

Soft and ſweet are the joys of Love,

Which every Virgin does long to prove,

I will not tarry, but Marry,

and every Rival will ſoon remove:

Bonny Suſan does muſe on all night,

Vpon all our joys and ſweet delight,

She dreams of Kiſſes, Embraces, and charms,

And ſhe ſtarts, and thinks my love in her arms

Sweetly looks the fair Bride in Bed,

With thouſand Cupids all round her head,

She ſoftly ſighs, and wiſhes, and Kiſſes,

as ſoon as the Curtains are cloſely ſpread:

Every Bridegroom does then what he pleaſe,

And the lovely Brides their flames appeaſe,

I need not name what young Lovers do do,

For 'tis known to every one, I and to you.

Mark how kindly ſhe looks next day,

More lively, lovely, more brisk and gay,

'Twould make maids long to be cooing & wooing

to ſee how theſe wantons do ſport & play:

Some new charm in his looks ſhe eſpies,

And then he looks Babies in her eyes;

Then while her fondling new pleaſures does ſeek

She kindly kiſſes and claps his cheek.

Vain it is to be nice and coy,

And let old Time all our youth deſtroy,

I like not Whining and pining,

for that which one eaſily mightly enjoy;

There are bonny, brisk lovers in ſtore,

And then what can Maidens wiſh for more,

What need has Suſan to ſigh and look pale,

When ſhe might o're Thomas his heart prevail.

Have not Women ſoft charms and Arts,

By Nature given to conquer hearts,

Which never does fail, but prevail,

as often as ever they ſhoot their Darts;

No brisk youth can withſtand a Maids charms

But does ſtrangely ſoften in her Arms,

The Rougheſt Hero in all the bright field,

To a brighter Beauty will bow and yield,

Now young buxom fair Maids come here,

And learn this Leſſon (to Love give ear)

The little Boy is ſo pritty and witty,

and pleaſant and ſoft, that you need not fear:

Roger he ſhall have Ciſley and Nan,

And young Kate ſhall kiſs my Ladies Man,

Doll ſhall have William, & Iohn ſhall have Ione,

And thus neither Sex shall lye alone,

FINIS.
