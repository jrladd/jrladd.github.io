I am, I confeſs, no great reader, of late, of new Books, having tried formerly, that to find in them the leaſt Jewel it muſt be ſifted out of a great deal of Rubbiſh, and the worſt is, that their Authors take up Errors upon truſt one from another, which the better they adorn with new dreſſes, the greater injury they do to man­kind. To make up ſuch Volumes out of Collecti­ons, as Bees gather Hony from this and that Flower, is rather laborious Induſtry than fine Wit; But to ſpin out of one's own Bowels, not Cobwebs as Spiders do, but rich Tiſſues of Gold and Silver, ex­preſſes a great Fancy well improved, with much thinking.

As there is variety of Sciences, ſo there are ſeveral ſorts of Capacities to acquire them, ſome proving excellent in one kind, ſome in another; but to be capable of all, as well Philoſophy as Playes, and Poems as Orations, be­longs only to a very few, whoſe Statues ſhould be erected in all the eminent Places in the World, for their Glory, and our Admiration.

But yet, had I nothing elſe to ſay in excuſe of my no ear­lier return to the laſt Noble effects of your Graces goodneſs, it were ſufficient; That my ſence of that mighty Honour was too big for my Pen; and when I began to ſpeak my reſentments of it, I found my ſelf as unable to expreſs them, as to deſerve their oc­caſion. Bet yet, Madam, this is not all the reaſon, for I was from home when your Grace's Preſent came, and have been ſo almoſt ever ſince; other­wiſe I had not added to my want of merit on other accounts, that alſo of appearing inſenſible, and de­fective in endeavours of acknowledgment; I muſt ſay endeavours, for my Gratitude can riſe no higher. Since my receipt of your Grace's ingenious Works, I have, as my occaſions would permit, caſt my Eyes again into them, and I am ſorry they cannot dwell there, where I find ſo pleaſing, and ſo in­ſtructive an entertainment. And though I muſt crave your Pardon for diſſenting from your Grace's Opinion in ſome things, I admire the quickneſs, and vigor of your Conceptions, in all: In which your Grace hath this peculiar among Authors that they are, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, your own, your Grace being indebted to nothing for them, but your own happy Wit, and Genius; a thing ſo uncommon even among the moſt celebrated Writers of our Sex, that it ought to be acknowledged with wonder in yours. And really, Madam, your Grace hath ſet <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5032"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=51">[Page 99]</a></span> us a patern, that we ought to admire, but cannot imitate. And whereas you are pleaſed ſometimes to mention your being no Scholar, as an excuſe of de­fects, your modeſty ſuppoſeth; By that acknow­ledgment you ſhew our imperfections that pretend we are ſo, rather than diſcover any of your own.</p><p>As for the laſt Trifle I was bold to preſent to your Graces Eye, it is much indebted to the ob­liging reception you were pleaſed to afford it; and there is nothing that ſets ſuch a luſtre on your Graces great Wit, and Intellectual Perfections, as that ſweet candor of your Spirit that renders you ſo acceſſible, even to your meaneſt admirers. Where­as your Grace is pleaſed to object againſt ſome part of the deſign of my Diſcourſe, that it ſets the per­fection of the ſenſe higher than that of Ratiocination; I humbly deſire that your Grace would conſider, that there are two ſorts of Reaſoning, <span class="hi">viz.</span> Thoſe that the Mind advanceth from its own imbred <span class="hi">Idaea</span>'s and native Store, ſuch are all Metaphyſical Contemplations. And thoſe natural reſearches which are raiſed from experiment, and the objects of ſenſe. The former are indeed moſt perfect when they are moſt abſtracted from the groſneſs of things ſenſible, but the others are then moſt compleat when they are moſt accomodated to them; and when they are not, they are Aery, and Phantaſtick. Now what I have ſaid about thoſe matters is to tie down the mind in Phyſical things, to conſider Nature as it is, to lay a Foundation in ſenſible collections, and from thence to proceed to general Propoſitions, and Diſcourſes. So that my aim is, that we may ariſe according to the order of nature by degrees from the exerciſe of our Senſes, to that of our Reaſons; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5053"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=52">[Page 100]</a></span> which indeed is moſt noble and moſt perfect when it concludes aright, but not ſo when 'tis miſtaken: And that it may ſo conclude and arrive to that per­fection, it muſt begin in ſenſe: And the more ex­periments our reaſons have to work on, by ſo much they are the more likely to be certain in their con­cluſions, and conſequently more perfect in their actings.

For, while Men are Men, there will be different Intereſts, and conſequently different Opinions: nor is the multitude of Follow­ers a certain ſign of the Soundneſs, but of the Gain­fulneſs of any Doctrine. If, therefore, the World, which is obſtinate (you know) and governed by pre­judice, will not be induced to eſteem, what you think uſeful; the blame lyes not at your Door, and you ought to conſolate your ſelf with this reflexion; that you have ſufficiently teſtified your good inten­tions, and done more than your Duty, in publiſhing your Conceptions. Beſides, the <span class="hi">Virtuoſi</span> of our <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> Univerſities have, of late years, proclamed open War againſt the tyranny of Dogmatizing in any Art or Science: and as for thoſe of the <span class="hi">Roman Religion;</span> there is, I fear me, but little hope, of ma­king them your Proſelites. Becauſe thoſe canting Polititians, called <span class="hi">School-men,</span> having made a new and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5642"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=58">[Page 113]</a></span> party-colour'd Veſt for the Church, of a kind of Drugget, conſiſting of the Thrums of <span class="hi">Peripatetic</span> Philoſophy, cunningly interwoven among the Gol­den threads of the Chriſtian Faith; and prevailed, upon Princes to make it Piacular for any Scholar to appear with his Judgement clad in any other Livery: it is not very unlikely, the Profeſſors there will ſoon be brought to offend their Superiors, by laying aſide the defence of <span class="hi">Ariſtotle</span>'s Maxims, to aſſume the Patronage of New. So that in my ſilly conceipt, as the Cabbage is obſerved to ſtarve the Vine, if ſet too near: ſo the Philoſophy of <span class="hi">Thomas Aquinas</span> and others of the ſame myſtical Tribe, will hinder the growth of yours, in the ſame Ground.</p><p>For your <span class="hi">MORAL</span> Philoſophy (for ſo I take liberty to call your occaſional Reflections upon the Actions, Manners, and Fortunes of Men) Your Grace has not, indeed tied up your Pen to the la­borious rules of Method, or the formality of a new Syſteme in <span class="hi">Ethics:</span> but (what is as well) you have opportunely, and under various heads, diſperſed many uſeful remarks, concerning Prudence, as well Civil, as Domeſtic, in moſt of your Writings. And this, it may be preſumed, you were pleaſed to do, not for want of Skill to reduce your rules of life into the order of dependence and connexion; but with de­ſign, to ſhew your plenty, and ſurprize your Readers with good counſel even where they leaſt expect it. You choſe rather to regale us with delicate Fictions, under the veil whereof wholeſom inſtructions are neatly contrived, than to embaraſs and tire us with the obſervation ofa long train of Precepts, which are never ſo effectual, as when naturally flowing from agreeable Inſtances and Examples: Your very in­terludes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5671"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=59">[Page 114]</a></span> contain adviſo's, and your digreſſions are ſeaſonably inſtructive: like wiſe Husbandmen, you plant Fruit-Trees in your Hedge-rows, and ſet Straw­berries and Rasberries among your Roſes and Lil­lies. This, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> is a piece of no ſmall art, though not obvious to common Eyes: and if any diſlike the courſe you have taken in thus ſcattering and diſguiſing your <span class="hi">Morals;</span> I would have him asked this Queſtion, Whether or no it be folly for a man to refuſe to gather Oranges and Citrons, only be­cauſe the trees that offer them, are not ranged in the Order of <span class="hi">Cyrus</span>'s <span class="hi">Quincunx?</span> or whether a Noſegay be leſs fragrant, becauſe pluck'd from Flowers grow­ing diſperſedly? To all who have read your <span class="hi">Comi­cal Tales,</span> with the ſame purity of Mind, with which you wrote them, and are withal qualified to ſearch into the Mythology of all your imaginary <span class="hi">Dialogues:</span> to all ſuch, I ſay, it is evident, that you have drawn the Images of all the <span class="hi">Virtues,</span> on one hand, and their oppoſite <span class="hi">Vices,</span> on the other, ſo much to the life; that men, beholding them, muſt be, by grateful violence, compelled to love the Pulchritude of thoſe, and abhor the deformity of theſe. Now, this, <span class="hi">Ma­dam,</span> you could not have done had you not firſt had the <span class="hi">Idea</span>'s of all Virtues within your ſelf: it being abſolutely neceſſary for a Painter, firſt to conceive the form or ſimilitude of the thing he intends to re­preſent, in his own Imagination; and then to make the reſemblance according to that form. So that in ſtrictneſs of truth, thoſe Pictures we call <span class="hi">Originals,</span> are but Copies, yea Copies of Copies: as being firſt drawn from the life in the Phantaſy, and after pourtrai'd upon Tables. Beſides this, your Grace is further happy, in that the <span class="hi">Morals</span> of your <span class="hi">Pen</span> are <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5729"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=59">[Page 115]</a></span> clearly exemplified in thoſe of your <span class="hi">Life;</span> in which I have never heard any thing blamed, any thing di­ſputed, unleſs whether it hath been more <span class="hi">Innocent,</span> or more <span class="hi">Obliging.</span> In fine, the Documents of both your <span class="hi">Pen</span> and <span class="hi">Life</span> ſeem to be ſo good, that who­ever is able to moderate his Paſſions, and regulate his Actions by them, needs not to ſeek further af­ter <span class="hi">Happineſs:</span> nor need I fear to pronounce him ar­rived at ſuch perfection, that it will not be eaſy for him to be brought to do ill, either out of <span class="hi">Weakneſs,</span> or out of <span class="hi">Deſign.</span></p><p>For your <span class="hi">POETRY;</span> therein your Grace hath more than a ſingle advantage above others.</p><p><span class="hi">First,</span> Your Vein appears equally facile, equally free, and copious upon all occaſions, in all ſorts of arguments. The Buskin and the Sock are equally fit for your Muſes Legs. Your Phanſy is too ge­nerous to be reſtrained: Your Invention too nimble to be fettered. Hence it is, that you do not always confine your Senſe to Verſe; nor your Verſes to Rhythme; nor your Rhythme to the quantity and ſounds of Sillables. Your Deſcriptions, Expreſſions, Similies, Allegories, Metaphors, Epithets, Num­bers, all flow in upon you of their own accord, and in full Tides: and Verſes ſtand ready minted in the Treaſury of your Brain, as Tears in ſome Womens Eyes, waiting to be called forth. So that in you is verified the Doctrine of <span class="hi">Plato,</span> in his <span class="hi">Dialogue</span> in­titled <span class="hi">Io;</span> that <span class="hi">Poeſy</span> is not a faculty proceeding from judgement, or acquired by labour and induſtry; but a certain divine Fury, or <span class="hi">Enthuſiaſm,</span> which ſcorning the controle of Reaſon, tranſports the Spirit in Rap­tures, as <span class="hi">Jove</span>'s Eagle did <span class="hi">Ganymed,</span> or as Witches are ſaid to be wafted above the Clouds on the wings <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5807"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=60">[Page 116]</a></span> of their Familiars. Which is, perhaps, the ground of that old ſaying, <span class="hi">nemo fit Poeta,</span> no Poet is made, but born ſo: as the rage and liberty of a Poetic Ge­nius gave occaſion to paint <span class="hi">Pegaſus</span> with Wings, in a flying poſture, and without a Bridle.</p><p><span class="hi">Secondly,</span> In your whole <span class="hi">Oglio</span> of Poems, I find nothing which is not intirely <span class="hi">Your own.</span> Like good Houſewifes in the Countrey, you, make a Feaſt wholly of your own proviſions: yea, even the Dreſſing, Sawces, and Garniture of the Diſhes are <span class="hi">Your own.</span> And were <span class="hi">Perilius Fauſtinus</span> revived (he, who out of envy to the Glory of <span class="hi">Virgil,</span> made and publiſhed a large Catalogue of his Thefts from <span class="hi">Homer</span> and <span class="hi">Heſiod)</span> he could hardly diſcover ſo much as a ſingle Verſe borrowed, by you, from any Poet, antient or modern. So circumſpect you are to avoid being thought a Plagiary, that you walk not in beaten Paths, but decline even the rules and methods of your Predeceſſors, and ſcorn Imitation, as a kind of Theft. A commendation, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> due to very few, perhaps to none beſides your ſelf. As your Grace, therefore, owes all your Poeſy to the inſpi­ration of your own happy Genius alone; ſo we owe all the Pleaſure we are ſenſible of in reading your Poems, to you alone. I may have many rivals in theſe my thankful acknowledgements, you can have no Competitor in the Glory of their occaſi­ons.</p><p>This double Felicity is augmented by the acceſſion of two others, no leſs worthy admiration. <span class="hi">One</span> is, that as you have made your ſelf an <span class="hi">Original,</span> ſo are you likewiſe ſecure from being <span class="hi">Copied.</span> You have indeed, given the world an illuſtrious Example; but you have given what it cannot take, the Example <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5862"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=60">[Page 117]</a></span> being of that height, that it is hardly attainable. You provoke our Emulation, and at the ſame time caſt us into deſpair. Your Poetical Fancies rather brave, than inſtruct our capacities: and by ſetting before our Eyes things inimitable, you vex our ambition, and oblige us to an unprofitable trouble.</p><p><span class="hi">Another</span> is, that you exceed all of your delicate Sex, not only in this age, but in all ages paſt. It would puzle the beſt Hiſtorian to find your Parallel among the moſt famous Women: and in the Mo­numents of the <span class="hi">Roman</span> greatneſs, even while that Glorious Nation held the Empire as well of Virtue and Wit, as that of the World, I cannot meet with an <span class="hi">Heroine,</span> to whom I dare to compare you. There are, I confeſs, who tell us of a Noble <span class="hi">Roman</span> Lady, one <span class="hi">Sulpitia,</span> who compoſed a Hiſtory of <span class="hi">Domiti­an</span>'s times, in Hexametre Verſes, and wrote many Elegant Poems beſides; and who hath been highly celebrated by <span class="hi">Martial, Tibullus, Sidonius Apollinaris,</span> and of late by <span class="hi">Scaliger</span> alſo, as an eminent Pattern both of a Chaſt and Immaculate Life, and of a neat Poetical Wit: and once I had ſome thoughts of drawing a Parallel betwixt that Lady and your Grace. But, upon a ſecond examination of the par­ticular Remarks, wherein I had fanſied the reſem­blance chiefly to conſiſt; and a more ſerious review of the Story of her Life, and the remains of her Pen, (extant among the <span class="hi">Fragments</span> of <span class="hi">Latine Po­ets,</span> and uſually annexed to <span class="hi">Petronius Arbiter)</span> I perceived, I could not proceed in that reſolution, without diſadvantage on your part, by a conference ſo unequal; and thereupon reſumed my former co­gitation, that your Grace's Statue ought to be placed <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5913"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=61">[Page 118]</a></span> alone, and at the upper end, in the <span class="hi">Gallery of Heroic Women,</span> and upon a Pedeſtal more advanced than the reſt. We read not that Nature hath been ſo Prodi­gal of her choiceſt Largeſſes, as to produce two <span class="hi">Cice­ro</span>'s, or two <span class="hi">Virgil</span>'s, or two <span class="hi">Ben Johnſon</span>'s: why, then, ſhould we ſeek after your Equal? It was their glory to be ſingle: and it muſt be yours, to have no Peer, for ought we know, you are the <span class="hi">Firſt</span> great Lady, that ever Wrote ſo much and ſo much of your own: and, for ought we can divine, you will alſo be the <span class="hi">Laſt.</span></p><p>Theſe, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> are a few of thoſe ſwarms of thoughts that crowded into my unquiet Head, when I propoſed to my ſelf to expreſs ſome part at leaſt of the great Honour and Reverence I owe your Grace. If I have ſo far obeyed the impulſe of my Gratitude and Devotion, as to put them into Words, and offer them to your knowledge; it was not, I aſ­ſure you, out of a vain conceipt, that they were anſwerable either to your vaſt Merits, or to my Obli­gations; but meerly upon Confidence, you would deſcend to exerciſe your Goodneſs and Candor, in receiving them as a ſimple recognition of both. And if I have ſuppreſſed the reſt; it was out of good Manners, and a due fear of farther offending your Patience. I am not ignorant, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> that our Prayers to God, and our Addreſſes to Princes ought to be ſhort.

As for your Inquiry about the Plaſtick Faculties; I Anſwer, that they are thoſe, whereby the Body is formed at firſt, and by which the Alimental Juices, are after, through the whole courſe of Life, orderly diſtribu­ted for the purpoſes of growth and nutrition: But whether, as your <span class="hi">Grace</span> inquires, they are Faculties inherent, in the Soul, or are only Mechanical Mo­tions <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6197"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=64">[Page 124]</a></span> of the Body I cannot determine certainly. But I rather incline to the <span class="hi">Platoniſts,</span> who will have the Soul to be the Bodies Maker, and they affirm (as is ordinary; though with ſome diverſity in the Names and Preſentation) That there are three ſorts of Faculties, which they Phancy as Analogous parts, or Regions in the Soul, <span class="hi">(Viz.)</span> The <span class="hi">Mind,</span> ſo they call the higheſt Faculties of abſtract Reaſon, and Underſtanding, which is the <span class="hi">Firſt.</span> The <span class="hi">Second</span> they call the <span class="hi">Soul, (Viz.)</span> as it is united to the Body, and exerciſeth the operation of Senſe. The <span class="hi">Third,</span> is the Image of the <span class="hi">Soul,</span> which is thoſe Fa­culties, that are called Plaſtical, that move and turn the Body, but are devoid of Underſtanding, or Senſe; Now how the <span class="hi">Soul,</span> which is Immaterial, can manage and order Corporeal Motions is a dif­ficulty of which Philoſophy as yet hath given no account, as I have particularly taken notice, and proved in my <span class="hi">Sceptis Scientifica,</span> but yet the thing ought not therefore to be denied, becauſe the man­ner of the moſt obvious ſenſible things is to us un­known; And by this we can only prove, that we have yet no certain Theory of Nature: And, in good earneſt, Madam, all that we can hope for, as yet, is but the Hiſtory of things as they are, but to ſay how they are, to raiſe general <span class="hi">Axioms,</span> and to make <span class="hi">Hypotheſes,</span> muſt, I think, be the happy priviledge of ſucceeding Ages; when they ſhall have gained a larger account of the <span class="hi">Phoenomena,</span> which yet are too ſcant and defective to raiſe Theories upon: ſo that to be ingenious and confeſs freely, we have yet no ſuch thing as Natural Philoſophy; Natural Hiſtory is all we can pretend to; and that too, as yet, is but in its Rudiments, the advance of it your <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6249"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=64">[Page 125]</a></span> <span class="hi">Grace</span> knows is the deſign and buiſineſs of the <span class="hi">Royal Society;</span> from whom we may reaſonably at laſt expect better grounds for general Doctrines, than any the World yet hath been acquainted with; but this, Ma­dam, is an excurſion. I therefore return to your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Letter, which inquires ſome things, about my No­tion of the <span class="hi">Souls</span> Original: As to this I would not be underſtood to affirm peremptorily a thing, which the greateſt part of Men, neither have, nor can re­ceive, only I conſider it as an <span class="hi">Hypotheſis,</span> that may be taken up to ſatisfy thoſe minds that are much troubled at the ſeeming inequalities of Providence; and whether true, or falſe, this I will take the bold­neſs to be confident in, That the Doctrine of the <span class="hi">Souls Praeexiſtence,</span> doth beſt ſuit with the appearan­ces of the World. And beſt Anſwers for the Di­vine Juſtice and Goodneſs, in all the affairs of Pro­vidence; In this Madam, I am a little <span class="hi">Dogmatical,</span> and this ſtep further, I think I may take, without im­modeſty; That the Doctrine hath ſo much to ſay for it ſelf, from Reaſon, and the higheſt Antiquity, as to render it fit to be conſidered, and indeed, ſince the two other wayes, are confeſſedly deſperate, me­thinks there ſhould be no harm in examining this; which is all I pretend to. But particularly to your <span class="hi">Grace</span>'s <span class="hi">Quaery,</span> Whether were <span class="hi">Souls</span> Created or Un­created?

That Mankind was ſo firſt, and fell by a voluntary Tranſgreſſion, is the com­mon Doctrine; and how we may ſuppoſe it was par­ticularly in the way of <span class="hi">Praeexiſtence,</span> your <span class="hi">Grace</span> will <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6324"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=65">[Page 126]</a></span> ſee eaſily, when I ſhall have procured that Book of mine, I have mentioned, and promiſed your <span class="hi">Grace,</span> but cannot yet light on. The other part alſo of your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Diviſion: <span class="hi">Viz.</span> That if thoſe <span class="hi">Souls</span> were Eternal, they are Gods; is I humbly conceive a miſtake likewiſe, ſince though the World, had been Created from Eternity (which even the Schools confeſs poſſible) it had nevertheleſs been a Creature, by reaſon of its dependence upon another, for its being, and to have been produced, and yet from Eternity, is no abſurdity, our Faith affirms it, in the Eternal Generation of the Son, and Proceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt, and to take an inſtance with which we may make more bold: If the Sun had been from Eternity no doubt it would have ſhone E­ternally, and yet it's Beams had been effects and de­pendent; And whereas your <span class="hi">Grace</span> ſaith again, That what is Immaterial is a God: I muſt here alſo take the boldneſs, to enter my Diſſent to your Propo­ſition; Indeed Mr. <span class="hi">Hobbs</span> denys all Immateriality to Created Beings, but I think upon grounds preca­rious and unſafe, That our <span class="hi">Souls</span> are Immaterial in their Natures, hath been ſufficiently proved by ſome late Philoſophers; particularly by the moſt learned Dr. <span class="hi">H.

But if ever any thing happen within the reach of my indeavours, by which I may ſerve or gratify your Grace, I ſhall then give evidence of the great reſentment I have of this condeſcention, and the Veneration which is due to a Perſon of ſo obliging and ſo unuſual a Virtue. Your Grace, I know, is Nobly inquiſitive, and hath a rich ſtock of generous Apprehenſions; and Perſons of this Character uſe to be pleaſed in the peruſal of the va­riety of others Conceptions; And on this account I preſume, that thoſe notions I ſometimes entertain my ſelf with, may not be unacceptable, being not alto­gether of the road and common track. And if your Grace pleaſe to permit, and pardon my Importuni­ties, I ſhall take occaſion to give you my ſenſe of ſome things that are not of the meaneſt concern­ments. For the preſent I am obliged to anſwer the particulars of your Grace's Letter, in which your Grace hath very much obliged me by thoſe argu­ments you are pleaſed to excuſe; and to them I make this humble return.</p><p>1. That whereas your Grace calls the Induce­ments to the belief of Witches, <span class="hi">probable Arguments,</span> I am apt, with ſubmiſſion, to think ſome of them to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6893"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=71">[Page 138]</a></span> be as great demonſtrations as matter of Fact can bear; being no leſs than the evidence of the Senſes, and Oaths of ſober Atteſtors, and the critical inquiries of Sagacious, and ſuſpitious Perſons; which Circum­ſtances of Evidence, your grace knows, ſome of thoſe Relations have to prove them. And there is a particular Story which is ſufficiently famous, and of part of which I my ſelf was a Witneſs, which I think is not ſubject to juſt Exception. 'Tis that of the Drum in the Houſe of Mr. <span class="hi">Mompeſſon</span> of <span class="hi">Tedworth</span> in <span class="hi">Wiltſhire.</span> Of this, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> I ſhall take an occaſion to give your Grace a particular ac­count, if you have not yet been acquainted with the circumſtances of that unuſual diſturbance. But to confine my ſelf now to your Grace's conſiderations on the ſubject; The ſecond thing I obſerve, is,</p><p>The intimation of an Argument againſt the Ex­iſtence of Witches, becauſe <span class="hi">they are not mentioned by Chriſt, and his Apostles,</span> concerning which I humbly deſire your Grace to conſider.</p><p>1. That Negative Arguments from Scripture uſe not often to be of any great ſignification or validity. Our Saviour ſpake as he had occaſion, and the thou­ſandth part of what he ſaid, or what he did, is not recorded, as one Evangeliſt intimates. He ſaid no­thing of thoſe large unknown Tracts of <span class="hi">America,</span> gives no intimations of the Exiſtence of that nume­rous People, much leſs any inſtructions about their Converſion. He gives no particular account of the affairs and ſtate of the other World, but only that general one, of the happineſs of ſome, and the mi­ſery of others. He makes no diſcovery of the <span class="hi">Mag­nalia</span> of Art, or Nature, no not of thoſe whereby the propagation of the Goſpel might have been <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6938"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=71">[Page 139]</a></span> much advanced; <span class="hi">viz.</span> The Myſtery of <span class="hi">Printing,</span> and the <span class="hi">Magnet.</span> And yet no one uſeth his Si­lence in theſe Inſtances as an Argument againſt the being of things, which are the evident Objects of Senſe. I confeſs the omiſſion of ſome of theſe particulars is pretty ſtrange and unaccountable, and an argument of our Ignorance of the Reaſons and Menages of Providence, but I ſuppoſe of nothing elſe; or if it were, I crave leave to add,</p><p>2. That the Goſpel is not without intimations of Sorcery, and contracts with evil Spirits. The ma­licious <span class="hi">Jews</span> ſaid our Saviour did his Miracles by their aſſiſtance, <span class="hi">He caſts out Devils by</span> Beelzebub. And he denys not the ſuppoſition or poſſibility of the thing in general, but clears himſelf by an appeal to the Actions of their own Children, whom they would not ſo ſeverely criminate. And beſides this,</p><p>3. The Apoſtles had intimations plain enough of the being of Sorcery and Witchcraft, as ſeems to me evident from <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 3. 1. <span class="hi">Gal.</span> 5. 20. <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 9. 21. <span class="hi">Rev.</span> 21. 8. <span class="hi">Rev,</span> 22. 15.</p><p>'Tis very true as your Grace ſuggeſts, that Su­perſtition and Ignorance of Cauſes make Men many times to impute the Effects of Art, and Nature, to Witchcraft and Diabolick Contract. And the Com­mon People think God, or the Devil to be in every thing extraordinary. But yet, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> your Grace may pleaſe to conſider, That there are things done by mean and deſpicable perſons, tranſcending all the Arts of the moſt knowing and improv'd <span class="hi">Virtuoſi,</span> and above all the Eſſays of known and ordinary Nature. So that we either muſt ſuppoſe that a ſottiſh ſilly old Woman hath more knowledge of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6990"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=72">[Page 140]</a></span> the intrigues of Art, and Nature, than the moſt ex­erciſed Artiſts, and Philoſophers, or confeſs that thoſe ſtrange things they performe, are done by con­foederacy with evil Spirits, who, no doubt, act thoſe things by the ways and applications of Nature, though ſuch as are to us unknown. This, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> is, I conceive, as much as is neceſſary to be ſaid to the Argumentative part of your Graces excellent Letter.</p><p>As for the following Periods, I am moſtly of the ſame Opinion with your Grace, in the way that I underſtand them. Nature is in a continual motion (for there is no ſuch thing as Reſt in the World) and perhaps that is not purely Mechanical, but may, in great part (at leaſt as to the beginnings and directi­ons of it) be aſcribed to the Soul of the World, which poſſibly is the great <span class="hi">Archeus</span> that formes Plants, Animals, and other more curious <span class="hi">Phoenomena.</span> And there is no doubt but (as your Grace ſuggeſts) that much wickedneſs is cauſed by the meer impulſe of Lower Nature; and I believe ſeveral Men are determined to Actions of Vice by the odneſs of their particular make and contexture. But whereas your Grace ſaith that nothing but God himſelf can be perfect, I cannot ſo well underſtand that. <span class="hi">Abſolutely ſo, and in all kinds,</span> 'tis true, I grant it, but your Grace doth not ſeem to intend the propoſition in that ſenſe. And to be Perfect in a lower kind is but to have all the parts and faculties that are re­quiſite to ſuch a being, in that order, diſpoſition, and all other circumſtances which are ſuitable to its <span class="hi">Idea,</span> and proper for its reſpective ends. And in this ſenſe I think all things are perfect in their firſt con­ſtitution; according to what your Grace ſaith af­terwards, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7023"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=72">[Page 141]</a></span> That [God cannot create any Imper­fection, being abſolute Perfection himſelf] which appoſitely fits mine, but I can not ſee how it ſo well conſiſts with your Graces former aſſertion, except it be intended to infer, <span class="hi">That God made nothing;</span> a Propoſition which methinks your Grace ſhould not own; but ſome things that follow ſeem to look that way, when you are pleaſed to ſay [Neither can I conceive how God could actually make or act any thing, either in a Mechanical manner, or a Free, being not locally moving] To which I humbly ſay that if your Grace doubts the poſſibility of the Cre­ation out of nothing, I think I can ſpeak ſome things as a Philoſopher, that may render it rea­ſonable. Nor is actual motion in the Deity neceſ­ſary to his actions, ſince he is Immenſe and needs not local motion to render him preſent by his Eſſence, or his Virtue, to any place of the great Univerſe, being Eternally there by the Infinity of his being, and his Power. And whereas your Grace is plea­ſed to ſay, that God is no Mechanick, I conſent that He is not ſo properly, in that he needs not material Inſtruments to act by. But yet he hath made all things by a kind of Geometry; in Number, Weight, and Meaſure, ſaith the <span class="hi">Holy Oracle.</span> And there is a ſort of Mathematicks in all the Works of Na­ture.</p><p>Thus, <span class="hi">Madam,</span> I have made bold with your <span class="hi">Graces</span> Patience, in confidence of your Candor, and your goodneſs, which I implore, for the Pardon of this Voluminous Trouble.

So that by reading of your <span class="hi">Philoſophy,</span> I have acqui­red thus much of advantage; that where I cannot Satisfy, I ſhall be ſure to Delight: which is ſome­what more than I dare promiſe from any other Diſcourſes of the ſame Title; in ſo much as they generally leave the Mind in a kind of Anxiety and Regret, when ever they fail to afford it Satisfaction. And, certainly, if it be (as ſome hold) reaſonable to allow, that the Fictions of Poets, and Roman­ciſts do uſually take as ſtrong hold of mens Minds, and Charm their Affections as powerfully, as the moſt Authentique Narrations of Hiſtorians; though the Reader well underſtands the Paſſages related by theſe, to be certain Truths, and the adventures de­ſcribed by Thoſe, to be meerly Imaginary; and this, becauſe Delight is equal on both ſides: if this, I ſay, be juſtifiable, that man can run but little hazard of his Judgement, who ſhall affirm, that your Suppo­ſition of Fayeries in the Brain, and of our Thoughts being their Conſults and Suggeſtions; and your opini­on that the Fayeries digging for Stones in the Quar­ries of the Teeth, to repair their decay'd Tenements in the Head, is the Cauſe of the Tooth-ach; are as worthy the hearing, as the moſt ſolid demonſtrative Theory of any Philoſopher whatever; inſomuch as theſe may yield both as high and laſting a Delight as that. I ſay Delight as High and Laſting; for, to ſpeak my Thoughts clearly, the Pleaſure that ariſeth from the comprehenſion of the moſt perfect and la­borious Demonſtration in <span class="hi">Geometry,</span> I never could find, either in height or duration, much to exceed that, which I have ſometime been affected withall, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7191"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=108911&amp;page=74">[Page 145]</a></span> at the recital of a Facetious Poetical Extravagancy, of which I had not afore heard. Nor do I believe, that the Raptures, and Exultations of <span class="hi">Don Quixot</span> were much inferior to that famous one of <span class="hi">Archimed,</span> which tranſported him out of himſelf, as well as out of the Bath, into a loud Exclamation, <span class="hi">I have found it, I have found it.</span> And the Reaſon of this Equa­lity may be well enough thought, to conſiſt chiefly in the unſatisfiedneſs of our Nature, which always hurrying our Minds on to Novelties, cauſeth us to put an equally cheap rate upon all things we think already in the poſſeſſion of our Underſtanding; and to value acqueſt of a freſh, though perhaps uſeleſs, and abſurd Opinion, above the calm fruition of an­tient and irregular Maxims. But, this <span class="hi">(Madam)</span> being a Paradox, ought to have more room, than can be ſpred in a Letter, whoſe deſign'd Argu­ment is Thankfulneſs: and beſides, ſhould I adven­ture further, to avouch it, the ſame could not but much redound to my diſadvantage; inſomuch as it might render me ſuſpected for ſomething of a Scho­lar, and conſequently incapable of the Honour and Pleaſure of ſometimes attending you, and hearing your more than ingenious Diſcourſes.

But I fear me, while I inſiſt thus particularly upon the Reaſon alleadged by theſe men, in defence of their Diffidence, I may fall into the ſame danger, for the avoidance of which, I even now left my Paradox deſtitute of Aſſertion: and therefore I lay by that ſubject, and take up another more opportune and conſiderable, as to the diſcharge of my Duty, and confeſſing how many wayes you have obliged me.</p><p>I acknowledge, therefore, in the laſt place; that my <span class="hi">Affections</span> muſt own you for their Benefactreſs.

When a Young, Noble, Beautiful, Witty, and Sprightly Lady, one on whom all the Pleaſures of the World ſeem to be Enamoured, and in throngs offer them­ſelves to be accepted and commanded by her; when ſuch an one, I ſay is heard to Preach up <span class="hi">Temperance, Abstinence, Modeſty, Chaſtity, Solitude,</span> and the ſuppreſſion of all irregular ſenſual Appetites.
