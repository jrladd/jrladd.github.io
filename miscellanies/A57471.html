or when Time first began to have a Being; for before the World was Created there was du­ration, or <span class="hi">Stabilis Aeternitas</span> [as the Schoolmen express it] but Time being an equal mensuration of Motion, it and Motion began together.</p><p>From this grand <span class="hi">Thesis</span> we may con­clude, First against <span class="hi">Aristotle,</span> who endea­vour'd by many Arguments to prove that the World, as it now stands in Matter and Form, was Eternal; which Hypothesis advanceth the World into an equality with God; makes it its own efficient Cause, Uncreated and Independent.</p><p>In the Second place this <span class="hi">Mosaick The­sis</span> concludes against <span class="hi">Plato</span> and his Fol­lowers; who, tho' he did positively as­sert, that God made the World; yet he did conceive that the Matter on which it did consist was Eternal and Pre-ex­istent: By which Hypothesis he con­cludes God to be an impotent cause, not able to create the World without Matter and Stuff to work upon.</p><p>These mistaken Principles in Philoso­sophy were occasion'd from the Ob­servation of the regular course of Na­ture; not considering that there might <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2479"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=25">[Page 3]</a></span> be other causes which might produce effects in an other way than cou'd ever come within the compass of their nar­row observation; for how Spiritual Causes produce their effects, its impos­sible for us whilst we continu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> in this dark state of Matter; wherein we have but a very short and narrow prospect to understand.</p><p>In the Third place it concludes a­gainst <span class="tcpmilestone">3</span> <span class="hi">Democritus</span> and his Followers, who did not only conceit that Matter was Eternal and Pre-existent; but that the World had no efficient cause, but what was from Chance, or the casual motion of Matter; which consisting of infinite numbers of Atoms or little Corpuscles of different Figures, Natures and Qua­lities, which rainged about in a vast and infinite space; until at the last by Divisions, Separations and Mixtures occasioned by their contrary and mixt Qualities, and the innate Power of Sympathy and Antipathy, they at last setled into the Form and Figure of this World, which it can no more alter or vary from, than the active Fire be taught to change its Nature, and descend and Gravation to ascend and fly up­ward.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2505"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=26">[Page 4]</a></span>No doubt but this Hypothesis wa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> grounded upon an experimental Obser­vation of the several Kinds of Matter of different Natures, which being mixt together in a Glass, or any transparent Vessel, will separate and divide them­selves <span class="hi">proprio m<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tu</span>;

and how far God Almighty might make u<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e of th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>se towards the forming the mater­rial part of this World.</p><p>We may hence farther conclude, that <span class="tcpmilestone">4</span> although neither the World as it stands, nor the Matter on which it consists did pre-exis<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>;

but did always display its self in a vigorous activity.</p><p>Besides the natural tendency of In­finite Power, is Action; of Infinite Wis­dom is Counsel; of Infinite Goodness is Beneficence: We cannot therefore but conclude from these Natural Arguments, that God would from all Eternity fol­low the inclinations of his own Divine Perfections.</p><p>From this grand <span class="hi">Thesis</span> we may yet <span class="tcpmilestone">5</span> futher conclude, that this Universal Fa­brick of the World was not created at one stroke, by an imperious <span class="hi">F<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>at</span>; for tho this might have been consistent with Infinite Power; yet it would not have been agreeable with Infinite Wisdom, which consists in Deliberation, Counsel and Contrivance.</p><p><span class="hi">Moses</span> therefore tells us that God first created the Heavens, and then the Earth: Like as some mighty Monarch designing to build a spacious and most glorious Palace, first forms the Model of it in his mind; and having prepar'd his Materials, sets on work his Under-agents, who first of all lay the Founda­tions, and compleat his own Royal Apartments, then the Apartments of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2605"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=27">[Page 6]</a></span> his chief Ministers of State, after that Chambers for his Domesticks, and last of all Lodgings for his out Servants; and the Work being finish'd, accord­ing to the Model which he gave his Architects to work by, he gives it his Approbation. In like manner, the Great and Almighty Monarch of the Universe may be supposed, first to have laid the Foundations of those Super-Coelestial Regions of unaccessable Light, the Royal Chambers of his own most Glorious Presence; where he sits in great Majesty attended with an innumerable retinue of the most Noble Angels his Courtiers: After these he creates the highest of the Coelestial Spheres, in which he placed Thousands of Royal Mansions, where the Arch-Angels and Brighter Cherubins, the chief Ministers of State in that Coelestial Kingdom keep their residence: And these are the Morning Stars which <span class="hi">Iob</span> tells us [by way of <span class="hi">Synecdoche</span>] that met together, and the Sons of God that did shout for joy. After these God created the inner or lower Spheres, in which he placed innumerable numbers of bright, lucid and Aetherial Globes; wherein the inferior Angels and Do­mestick <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2620"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=27">[Page 7]</a></span> Officers do inhabit, and these the Scripture stiles <span class="hi">Ministring Spirits.</span></p><p>And these differ in Office, Power and Light, as they are placed in Spheres nearer, or at a distance from the Re­gions of Light: For as one Star differ­eth from another Star in Glory, Light, Purity and Magnitude; So do their Heavenly Inhabitants: And so shall it be in the Resurrection from the Dead; for as Men improve here in Vertue, Goodness and the Divine Life and Light, so shall they be placed nearer, or at a distance from God, the Foun­tain of Life and Light.</p><p>After the finishing of these Inner Courts of this Royal Palace, last of all God created this Material Globe or Outer Court; and made it the Center of the Universe: And it's built of the Rubbidge, Dross and Sediment of the whole Creation, and inhabited with the meanest of Creatures, and lowest degree of Life and Perfection, which may most properly be called God's out Servants; over which he has pla­ced Man Deputy Lord Governour.</p><p>This Material Globe, tho it appears in its own dimensions to be o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> great Magnitude to us (who bear not so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2643"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=28">[Page 8]</a></span> much proportion to it, as a Mole-hill does to the greatest Mountain) yet being compared to the whole Universe [if the computation of the best Philoso­phers be true] it will scarce bear pro­portion to the Ninety six thousand part of it.</p><p>It cannot therefore be imagined that the Wise Creator [who never made a­ny thing in vain, but to the best end<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> and wisest Purposes<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>] should be so fond of a piece of dull stupid Matter, as to create all those innumerable numbers of Bright, Lucid, Aetherial Globe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> (the least of which exceeding this Mole-hill in Magnitude by several Diameters) for no other end or purpose than di­stinguishing of Days, Months, Seasons and Years; and for casting a dark glimmering light to us poor Mortals.</p><p>As God Almighty finished any part of the Creation, he gave it a motion, and this motion it performs naturally and insensibly, without labour or difficulty; as our Blood circulates through our Veins and our Vital Spirits glide in the Nerves through the whole Body.</p><p>The Almighty having now finished the Creation which made up but one Royal Palace, containing in it innu­merable <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2673"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=28">[Page 9]</a></span> Mansions, fit for the Subjects of so great a Monarch to live in: He sits at the Helm of this Floating Uni­verse, and Steers all its motion<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> with a steddy and unerring hand.</p><p>And it can be no more labour to God to govern and actuate this World; who as an Universal Soul is diffu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>'d in it, and is vitally present in every part of it, than for a Man's rational Soul by Will and Cogitation, to move a Finger or a Toe, or any other part of his Bo­dy; tho at the greatest distance from its Seat.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.2"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2690"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=29">[Page 10]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.2. </span><span class="head">CHAP.

But in my Opi­nion, the World [according to the Old Proverb] was more affraid than hurt by them.</p><p>For that Comets are Fiery Mete­ors, and have such dreadful Effects following their Appearance, is a Mi­stake in Meteorology so palpable, that it needs no Confutation:</p><p>That which we call a Comet, being no more than a Star of a Fiery and Lu­minous Body, in Conjunction with an other Star of an Opake and Waterish Substance, or a Vast Coelestial Cloud, which by receiving into its Body the Bright Rays of the Luminous Star, be­comes Translucent, and appears to us in the Form and Figure of a Luminous <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9726"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=123">[Page 193]</a></span> or Fiery Globe; and by emitting Beams or Streams of Light, it appears to be a Fiery and Burning Meteor, which by the Meteorologists is call'd a Comet.</p><p>If this Conjunction and Interposition be Centrical, it sends forth its Beams of Light on every Side; and this we call a Bearded Comet.</p><p>If the Interposition be not Centrical▪ but the Luminous Star be higher or lower, or on one side, it sends forth a Beam or Stream of Light upward or downward, or to one side; and this Beam or Stream of Light, is call'd the Tail of the Comet.</p><p>The Appearance of this Comet con­tinues until their different Motions have separated them.</p><p>A demonstration of this you may have several Evenings, when a black waterish Cloud interposeth between us and the Body of the Sun; if the Inter­position be Centrical, the Sun's Beams stream out every way; if the Sun be higher, it sends forth its Beams of Light downward; if lower, upward, or to one side, according to the Interposition of the Cloud.</p><p>Against this Hypothesis, it may be Objected, that there is no such thing in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9745"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=124">[Page 194]</a></span> Nature as an Opake Waterish Coelesti­al Body.</p><p>To which I answer, That th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Moon is an Opake Globe of a Waterish Sub­stance; and if its Natural Course and Motion was not within the compass of the Suns Atmosphere, it would be to us invisible: So there may be [for a­ny thing that we know] Thousands of Opake Globes, within the Vast Expan­sion of the Coelestial Spheres, which are never visible to us, but when they fall into Conjunction, or Oppositon, with a Luminous Star: And when these Opake Globes are of a Round and Waterish Substance, they appear to us in the Form of Comets.</p><p>Again, it is most probable that all these New Stars, which have appear'd for some time, and then disappear'd, [which Astronomers have given such Remarkable Accounts of,] are only O­pake Globes, made visible for sometime, by their being in Conjunction or Oppo­sition to a Luminous Star, and when their different Motions have separated them the Opake Star hath disappear'd.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.4_div.2_div.7"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9769"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=60989&amp;page=124">[Page 195]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">4.2.7. </span><span class="head">CHAP.
