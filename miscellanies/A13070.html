But whereas in hiſtories wee muſt not onelie looke for the euentes, but much more the cauſes of the euents muſt bee ſought for this meditation comprehendeth alſo a con­ſideration of the cauſes, for which the Meſsias was made a ſacri­fice and Redeemer. For it is needefull that the cauſes of ſo great a matter bee neither ſlender nor fained, but great and weightie cauſes, which we ſhall thorowly beholde when God ſhall be all in all. Now let vs diligently learne the elements which are de­liuered in the worde, and let vs craue of God that hee would go­uerne with his holy ſpirit, our purpoſe vndertaken touching the greateſt matters.</p><p>And although ſome vnlearned perſons fondly diſpute, y<sup>t</sup> God ſeeing he is omnipotent, could reſtore mankinde into his ancient liberty and dignity by other maner of means: yet let vs ſo hold it determined y<sup>t</sup> god doth not any way decline frō his righteouſnes which thing ſith ſo it is, God muſt not only haue his place of mercy, but alſo of righteouſnes attributed vnto him, touching his ſe­cret prouidence in the redeeming of mankind. As therefore the immenſe mercy of God would not beholde the vniuerſall death and deſtruction of our nature, according to that ſaying of <span class="hi">Iere­my, Lament. 3. cap. 22. It is the mercy of the Lorde that we are not conſumed:</span> So the eternall and vnchangeable righteouſneſſe of God required a ſatisfaction for the offence and for the puniſh­ment. For the Law of God which is a rule of iuſtice in God, diſ­cerneth good and euill, and bindeth the reaſonable creature to become conformable to that rule, and denounceth horrible deſtruction vnto all thinges which are contrary to that rule. Wherefore ſeeing the ranſome pacifieng the wrath of God, and ſatisfieng the righteouſneſſe of God, could neither bee paide by Angels nor by any other creature, becauſe the malice of ſinne is infinit, and no creature is able to endure the wrath of God, it is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1820"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=13845&amp;page=16">[Page 26]</a></span> by Gods wonderfull wiſedome decreed; that the ſecond perſon of the Godhead which is called <span class="hi">the word</span> ſhould take vpon him the nature of man, and ſhould ſatisfie the lawe of God for the fault and puniſhment in mankind: That is, that he, which knew no ſinne, ſhould take vpon him to redeeme vs from ſinne, that by him we might bee made the righteouſneſſe of God. In this decree, with admiration whereof the very Angels ſtand amazed at, do ſhine the righteouſneſſe and mercie of God: alſo the vn­ſpeakeble humility and loue of God towardes vs. For there is no remiſsion of ſinnes graunted, without recompence and ſatis­faction made. For, thinke, I pray you, howe great the force of Gods wrath is againſt ſinne, when he could not be pacified with any other ſacrifice, but by the paſsion and death of the immacu­late Lambe: And we indeed by the greatneſſe of this remedie may eſteeme the greatneſſe of our ſickneſſe and ſore.

Againe alſo it affirmeth manifeſtlie, that this Sauiour muſt alwayes bee called vpon, yea, when he is not ſeene with our eyes. He ſpeaketh not here then of the geſtures of the bodies, which with reuerence is vſed towards them, but by them towardes Chriſt; and hee ſpea­keth generallie of all good mindes, which do craue of the ſame our Sauiour Chriſt, that he would haue mercie vpon vs, and bee our Mediator vnto his father, that he would forgiue vs our ſinnes, giue vs his holie ſpirit and life euerlaſting, and bee our defender and helper in the daungers of this life againſt the furies of the Diuels, and the wicked ones in this worlde. Such a kind of pray­er yeeldeth rightlie omnipotencie vnto the Sauiour, and wit­neſſeth that he is God. But y<sup>•</sup> indeed his kingdom is not a world­lie policie, but ſpirituall and eternall. Theſe Arguments do con­firme the ſame. The benefite of the Sauiour pertaineth vnto the vniuerſall Church, from the beginning of the world vnto the end of the ſame. Now if the kingdome of Chriſt had bin politike, it ſhould not haue brought anie profit or vtilitie vnto the Fathers and Prophets which haue departed out of this life, before the cō ­ming of the Sauiour. Therefore nothing ſhoulde their prayers and hope differ in this caſe from the dreame of the golden fiſh, wherof the fiſher reioyced, as <span class="hi">Theocritus</span> reporteth, Adde here­vnto a moſt ample promiſe of the calling of the Gentiles, which ſhould be vaine and ridiculous, if the Iewes onely ſhould carrie all the ſtately port and beare rule, and the Gentiles bee brought into bondage as their ſlaues. But of all others chieflie the ſayings of the Prophets confirme this opinion which wee would attaine vnto,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note102">The predicti­ons of the pro­phets touching Chriſts ſuffe­ring for mans ſaluation.</span> becauſe they preach of the death and reſurrection of the Sauiour. <span class="hi">D<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>niel</span> ſayeth plainlie, cap. 9. verſ. 26. <span class="hi">Chriſt ſhall bee ſlaine.</span> And <span class="hi">Iſayas</span> ſayeth, cap. 35. 10. <span class="hi">He ſhall lay downe his ſ<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ule for ſinne.

Theſe and manie other ſuch like when we read, may we doubt any thing, but that the Iewes and others (drea­ming of the kingdome of Chriſt to be politicall) are wrapped in the greateſt error, and blinded in the ignoraunce of the greateſt matters? Alſo manie were woont to aske of vs what were the be­nefites of Chriſts kingdom: Touching this queſtion the Pſalme maketh anſwere: That the Sauiour of the worlde ſhall not giue riches and Countries, but Righteouſneſſe and Peace. But Righ­teouſneſſe ſignifieth in this place Forgiuenes of ſinnes, and re­conciliation with God, or imputation vnto righteouſnes, or ac­ceptation vnto life euerlaſting: wherewith after our reſurrection ſhall be ioyned full and perfect newneſſe inflamed with ſpiritu­all motions, ſuch as the lawe of God requireth.

Although the Father neuer depar­teth from the ſonns, yet is it not ſaide that hee ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, but the ſonne ſhall iudge them, becauſe there neither the deitie of the Father, nor of the ſonne ſhall be ſéene, but that forme or likenes of the ſonne which he hath vnited vnto him by the myſterie of his incarnation. The ſame forme or likenes in him then ſhall be Iudge, which ſtood before the Iudge; the ſame ſhall iudge which hath bin iudged, that the wicked ones may beholde his glorie, againſt whoſe clemencie they haue grudged. Such a Iudge therefore ſhall he appeare, as he may bee ſeene both of them whom hee ſhall crowne, and of them whom he ſhall condemne. But the Fa­ther ſhall not then appeare, becauſe he tooke not vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruant, but vnto his <span class="hi">Sonne</span> who was alſo made <span class="hi">Man,</span> hath be giuen all power of iudgement. Thirdly, this firſt verſe confirmeth the Reader to acknowledge Chriſt, not one­lie to be the ſon of <span class="hi">Dauid</span> after the fleſh, but alſo the verie ſon of God.

But peraduenture ſome man would ask what maner of kingdom, the kingdom of Chriſt is? There is nothing that we may so eaſily expresse. The kingdome of the Chriſt in this life; is to kéepe and reſtore the miniſterie of the Gospell: alſo to gather and reuiue the Church with his worde and holie ſpirit giuen, and to protect her wonderfullie againſt the diuels and tyrants, &amp; after this life to raiſe her members vp from death to life, and bring them to his eternall Father. Out of this de­scription maie be taken the difference of Chriſtes kingdome and a politike kingdome. Alſo they differ in obiects, in bene­fites, in forme of gouernment, glorie, defences, and stabilitie: for, firſt the politike power gouerneth the part which is moue­able, and brideleth the externall members, that they may re­maine within their duties: but the kingdome of Christ not onelie gouerneth externall manners, but reprehendeth and healeth the hearts, as in <span class="hi">Iſay, 61. ver. 1. To binde vp the bro­ken hearted.</span> Secondlie, the chiefe benefits of politike power are discipline and peace of bodies: but the ſpirituall and eter­nall benefits of this kingdome, are righteouſneſſe and peace of conſcience before God. Thirdlie, they differ in forme go­uernment: for other kings and princes chuſe fit miniſters to beare authoritie in the Common-wealth, endued with wiſe­dome and eloquence: but Chriſt chooſeth the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſedome of the wiſe: or as the 8, <span class="hi">Pſalme, ver.</span> 2. ſaieth. <span class="hi">Out of the mouth of verie babes and ſuck­lings, he hath made perfect his kingdome.</span> Moreouer they differ in forme of execution, as in defence, and punishments: for the politike power defendeth his ſubiects with weapons, and puniſheth diſobedient persons with corporall force, or with the ſworde: but Chriſt by the preaching of the Goſpell giueth euerlaſting benefits, remiſſion of ſinnes, the holie Ghoſt, and life euerlaſting, and puniſheth diſobedient persons, not with <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4319"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=13845&amp;page=38">[Page 71]</a></span> corporall force, but with his worde, namelie lawfull excom­munication. Fourthlie, they differ in glorie: for the glorie of gouernments is in the excellencie of counſell in ciuill or peaceable gouernment, and in valiancie and good successe in warre: but the proper glorie of the Church in this life is, true knowledge of God, prayer, profeſſion of the true doctrine, and perpetuall preſeruation of the Church, although ſhee bee perſecuted in ſome members. The greatnes of minds in o­uercomming or vanquiſhing all inticements and terrifying torments of the wicked, the ornament of manie vertues wherein the preſence of God is perceiued and ſeene. Fiftlie, the defences of a politike kingdome are hoaſts of men, and ri­ches neceſſarie in charges of domeſticall affaires &amp; to main­taine warres abroad: but the Church is not defended with viſible helpes, but is gouerned by the ſonne of God, and hath the Angels her ſuper intendents or watchmen. Laſtlie, they differ in ſtabilitie: for all politike gouernements haue their end and limit of time: but of this kingdome there shall bee none end, becauſe the king in eternall, and he giueth vnto his people eternall life, which is here begun, and shall be accom­plished after the reſurrection. These things muſt bee often re­cited touching the difference betweene Chriſts kingdome, and politike kingdomes: not onelie to refuſe the Iewes, but e­uen to inſtruct vs alſo, leaſt the conſolation &amp; inuocation vp­on the Sonne of God, and our exerciſes of faith be obſcured or darkened with politike imaginations. For the eyes being bent vpon politike benefits (when they are once gon) do think that the church is but a caſtaway from god.
