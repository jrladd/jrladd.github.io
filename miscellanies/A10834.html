And, if any others any where, surely I, and they with me, have need to get this divine comfort deeplie printed in our hearts; whose profession giues oc­casion to many, as doth our condition liberty unto all, to spare no severitie of censure upon us.</p><p>Four sorts of heavie freinds we have found, and felt in sorrow­full experience wheresoever we have become.

And as the Apostles in their dayes were everie where most vexed with the hatred of the unbeleeving Iewes, their own coun­trymen; so are we by the like of ours like mynded. Of whom whilst the most do want their countrie for causes so unlike unto <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e232"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=3">[Page 4]</a></span> ours, no marvayl though there be no better concurrance of eyther affection, or action between us.</p><p>The second is of them, who are enamoured on that Romish Hierarchie, as on a stately, and potent Ladie. Against which, and for the holy presbyteriall government, as Christs institution by his Apostles, whilst we doe in word and deed, give a free, &amp; full testi­monie; alasse, with how many, and how great waves of affliction are we overwhelmed by their <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>atred, and power? Dem<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>trius of Ephesus, with his Silver-smiths, was of all other men, to the Apo­stle Paul (opposing himself to the Majestie of Diana, and the<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> pro­fit withall) the most infestuous.

These men whilst they are over good, and easie towards the evill, and injurious, unto whom they give credence; become injurious themselus to the good, and in­nocent: though in truth it be hard to say, unto which of three they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e285"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=3">[Page 5]</a></span> doe the greatest wrong▪ whether to their brethren, of whom they causelesly conceaue amisse, whilst either they greedily devour, or easily receave such false reports, &amp; vituperies, as venemous tongues spit out against them: or to their own souls, which they thereby make accessorie to others mallice: or to the calumniators them­selus, whom they put in heart to go bouldly on in reproaching the innocent, whilst they know, where to finde receavers for their slaunders, as do theeues for their stoln goods.</p><p>Now, alasse, what sufficient bulwark of defence haue we (poore people) to oppose unto the violence of so many, and mightie ad­versaries? First, and most (as a brazen wall) <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> cons<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ence be­fore God, and men (so farre as humain frailtie will permit) pure, and unsteyned.

The former, by some of those, who in our owne countrie, are reputed the cheif Masters and Patrons both of Religion &amp; truth: by whom there hath been, not a flying bruit spread amongst the multitude; but a solemn accusation to them in speciall authoritie, framed a­gainst us: First, that we (lewd Brownists) do refuse, and reject one of the Sacraments: secondly, that we haue amongst us no ecclesi­asticall <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e372"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=4">[Page 6]</a></span> ministrie, but doe giue libertie to everie mechanicall person to preach publiquely in the church. Thirdly, that we are in errour about the verie Trinitie. Fourthly, and lastly, that being become so odious to the magistrates here, as that we are by violence to be driven the countrie, we are now constreyned to seek some other, and farr parte of the world to settle in.</p><p>The other contumelie is in a Duch Rhime without name, fra­med it may be, (and as commonly it comes to passe) between the cup and the wall, as sayth the proverb. This balad-maker compa­ring the receaved religion in the Dutch churches to a tree: the Sec­taries in the countrie (of which he nameth not a few) to certayn beasts endeavouring this trees ruine, and overthrow, likens the Brownists to a litle worme, gnawing at the root thereof; and not having lesse will, but lesse power to hurte, then the residue. Wee are indeed <span class="hi">wormes and not men,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note11">Psal. 22, 9.</span> <span class="hi">the reproach of men, and despised of the people,</span> whom high and low, and all that will, may without daun­ger, tread, and trample under foot.</p><p>But to giue thee satisfaction (Christian and indifferent Reader) whosoever thou art, that chusest rather to take knowledg of mens innocencie, then to condemn the same unknown; and that it may appear unto thee, how alike unhonest our adversaries are in their accusations, though of unlike condition in themselus, We do pro­fesse before God and men, that such is our accord in the case of re­ligion, with the Duch reformed churches, as that we are ready to subscribe to all, and everie article of faith in the same church, as they are layd down in the <span class="hi">Harmonie of Confessions of fayth,</span> published in their name: one onely particle (and the same not of the greatest weight) in the sixth Article, <span class="hi">touching the Scriptures,</span> being conveni­ently interpreted, and conformably to it self, &amp; the generall judg­ment of the learned amongst them.</p><p>The scope of the Article is, (as appears in the margent) to di­stinguish between <span class="hi">the books Canonicall, and Apocriphall, as they are called.</span> Touching which Apocryphall notwithstanding it is judg­ed, and affirmed, that <span class="hi">they may be read in the Church.</span> Which if it be meant of their private reading by the members of the church, we willingly assent: if of publique, pastorall, and ecclesiasticall read­ing, we are indeed otherwise mynded: neither admit we any other <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e427"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=4">[Page 7]</a></span> books to that dignitie in the church, then such as were penned by the <span class="hi">Holy men of God, moved by the Holy Ghost.</span> 2 Pet. 1, 21. And as the Apostle Iames testified of the Iewes,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note12">Act. 15. 21.</span> that <span class="hi">they had Moses read in the Synagogue everie Sabbath day:</span> so we think it sufficient for the Christian assemblyes, that with Moses Christ, that is, the books of the new testament be joyned with the old, and they alone be read.</p><p>Neither need we seek further, or for other Arguments to con­firme our opinion, then the Article it self affoardeth us. The words thereof are these:</p><p>Moreover, we put a difference between the Holy writings,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note13">Harmonie of Confess. Of the script. Art. 6, Conf. Belg.</span> and those which they call Apocryphal, to wit, so as the Apocryphall may indeed <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> read in the church, &amp; that it may be lawfull to take instructions from <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>hem, so far sorth, as they agree with the canonicall books: but such <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> hand is their authoritie, or firmnes, that upon their testimonie any doctrine of faith, and Christian Religion may be founded, much lesse that they haue force to infringe, or weaken the others authoritie.</p><p>And first, if the Apocriphall books be publiquely read in the Church, as well as the Canonicall, the difference which in word is professed, seems indeed by this so reading them, to be taken away: since the selfe same religious act (viz. publique reading) is perfor­med about the one and other, although not altogether to the same end. And if publique reading of the Canonicall Scriptures be commanded of God in his worship, either the reading of these Apocripha books is a parte of Gods worship also, (which the Bel­gick Churches do not beleiv) or els they must be unlawfull to be read publiquely in the Church, especially comming together for that onely end of worshipping God. Publiquely, I say; for the pri­vate reading of them, as of other books, comes not under the re­spect of worship properly, but of an act, and exercise <span class="hi">preparati<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span></span> unto worship, as both Law<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ers, and Divines speak.</p><p>Secondly, in this verie Article, the Canonicall bookes, as op­posed to the Apocriphall, are called <span class="hi">holy writeings.</span> The Apocri­phall then are not holy, as not being hallowed to this end, that is not commaunded of God in the holy writeings of the Prophets, and Apostles. Now what haue the holy assemblies to do, especial­ly convening, and meeting together for the solemn worship of God, and exercising themselus in the same, with books not holy, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e492"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=5">[Page 8]</a></span> that is, not hallowed, or injoyned of God, for his most holy ser­vice<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></p><p>Thirdly, seeing these books are <span class="hi">Apocriphall,</span> that is, hidden, and concealed, their verie name may put them in minde of their duetie in concealing themselvs within the vaile of privacie. And surely no small immodestie it is in them, which ought to conteyn themselus in private use, and interteynment, thus bouldly to presse into pub­lique assemblie. They must therefore change either their names, or their manners; as women by their sex, so they by their name, well expressing their nature, are inhibited all libertie of speaking in the church.</p><p>I<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d, and conclude out of our countrie-man M. Broughton, that those Apocriphall books are so stuffed with trifles, fables, lyes and superstitions of all sorts; that the midle place between the ould and new Testament, as ill becomes them, as it would do a Turkish slaue, and leaper, between two the noblest Princes of all Europe.</p><p>But to return whence I dig<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>essed.

And with what con­science of a Christian, or rather licentiousnes of a Rhymer, could that adversarie traduce us to the world, as endeavoring the ruine of the reformed churches?</p><p>But perhaps, that which may be, is suspected to be by some, (which also the false accuser doth insinuate in his libell against us) and that, what in word we professe, we denye in deed; and what we would seem to build with our tongues, we do, as it were, with our hands pull down. If so it be, and that in deed we be found <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e556"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=5">[Page 9]</a></span> to be such, I doe freely confesse, that no censure upon us can be too severe, no hatred more greivous then we do deserv.</p><p>Now the guilt of this evill must cleav unto our fingers, if at all, one of these two wa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es, either in regard of our selvs, or of the re­formed Churches. For our selvs, and our course of life, (for ne­cessitie compelleth, as it were foolishly to bable out that, wherein modestie perswadeth silence) and how we converse with God, and men, whether publiquely in the Church, or privately in the fami­ly, we refuse not, by the grace of God bestowed upon frayl crea­tures, labouring of the same humain infirmities with other men, the search and censure of our most bitter adversaries, if not desti­tute of all, both honestie, and wisdom.</p><p>Touching the reformed Churches, what more shall I say? We account them the true Churches of Iesus Christ, and both professe, &amp; practise communion with them in the holy things of God, what in us lyeth; their sermons such of ours frequent, as understand the Dutch tongue; the sacraments we do administer unto their known members, if by occasion any of them be present with us; their di­stractions, and other evils we do seriously bewayl, and do desire from the Lord their holy, and firm peace.</p><p>But happily, it wil be objected, that we are not like-mynded with them in all things, nor do approve of sundry practises in use a­mongst them, if not by publique institution (which it seems they want) yet by almost universall consent, and uniform custome. I graunt it; neither doubt I, but that there are many godly, and pru­dent men in the same churches, who also dislike in effect the things which we doe: and amongst other things, this mal<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>part, and un­bridled bouldnes of unskilfull men, who make it a very May-game to passe most rash censure upon the fayth, and so by consequence, upon the eternall salvation of their brethren, and to impeach their credit, whom they neither do, nor perhaps willingly would know: lest that which they lust to condemn unknown, they should be constreyned to allow, if they once knew it: and withall to disallow that, into which they themselvs haue been led formerly by common errour of the times. Which maladie is also so frequent, and ordi­narie, as that it may truely be said of many, that they then think themselus most acceptable unto God, when they can make their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e595"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=6">[Page 10]</a></span> brethren (differing from them in some smaller matters) most odi­ous unto men.

Ad hereunto, that in these huge and vast flocks, the governers cannot take knowledg of the manners of the people private, or publick; no nor so much, as of their presence at, or ab­sence from the church assemblies: whereby what domage cometh unto true pietie, any man may easily conjecture, and miserable ex­perience makes too too manifest in the reformed Churches.

The Catholick church, with due reverence unto learned ned men be it spoken, is verie unskilfully said to be one, as the sea is one. For, first, it is expressedly said Gen. 1, 9, 10. that <span class="hi">the wa­ters which were under the heauens, were gathered into one place,</span> or con­ceptacle, which God called Sea, or <span class="hi">seas.</span> But the Catholick church, which is said to comprehend al particular congregations in her bo­som, is not gathered together into one place, nor ever shall be, be­fore the glorious coming of Christ. 2. The Ocean is a body so continued, as that all, and everie part thereof is continually fluent, so as the self same waters, which in their flux do make one sea, do in their reflux by contrarie windes, make another, and so contrarie­wise. But thus to affirm of particular churches, and their materiall constitutive cause, were most absurd. 3. If some one particular sea were drawn drie, or should fail his course, a disturbance of all the rest would necessarily follow; But and if the sea should in di­vers <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e843"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=7">[Page 13]</a></span> places at once happen to be exhausted, or drawn drie, there would then be a fayling of the Ocean: neither were the waters now gathered into one place, neither made they one sea, and bo­dy of water, either continued, or conjoyned. But now, on the other side, upon the defection, or dissipation of this or that parti­cular church, no such impediment should come in the way, but that the rest might hould their full course, as before. Yea, I adde moreover, if all, and everie particular assembly in the world should languish, and fall away, (one onely excepted) that (onely) one did still remain the true, &amp; entire Church of Christ, without any either subordination, or coordination, or dependencie spirituall, save un­to Christ alone. The reason is plain, because this singular, and sole assembly may under Christ the head, use, and enjoy everie one of his institutions: the communion of Saints combyned together in solemn, and sacred covenant, the word of God, Sacraments, Censures, and ministrations whatsoever by Christ appointed, and therewith the same Christs most gratious presence.</p><p>And upon this ground it is, that the Apostle Paul doth intitle the particular congregation, which was at Corinth, and which pro­perly, and immediately he did instruct, and admonish,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note24">1 Cor. 12, 27. 2 Cor. 6, 10<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> &amp; 11, 2.</span> to <span class="hi">the body of Christ, the temple of God,</span> and <span class="hi">one virgin espoused to one housband Christ.</span> We may <span class="hi">not</span> therefore under pretence of antiquitie, unitie, humain prudence, or any colour whatsoever, <span class="hi">remove the auncient bounds</span> of the visible and ministeriall church, which our right <span class="hi">fa­thers,</span> to wit, the Apostles, have set, <span class="hi">in compar<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>son of whom, the most ancient of those,</span> which are so called, are but infants,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note25"><span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n Prov.</span> and <span class="hi">beardlesse,</span> as one truely, and wittily sayth.</p><p>There is indeed <span class="hi">one church,</span> and as the Apostle speaketh, <span class="hi">one bodie, as one spirit, one hope of our calling, one sayth, one baptism;</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note26">Eph. 4, 4, 5.</span> that is, of one kinde, and nature; not one in number, as one Ocean.

It is not lawfull for thee (reverend brother) to do the work of a Pastour where thou art no Pastour, lest thou arrogate to thy self that ho­nour, which apperteyns not unto thee.

If any shall answer, that this gratious promise of God is not to be restreined to the next immediate children, but is extended euen to those, who follow a fa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>r off, I grant it, except infidelitie, or other sin come between; by which the parents with themselvs break off their seed externally &amp; actually from the cōmunion of the church, &amp; holy things thereof. And if we be not to insist in the next, and immediate parent, why in the grand-father, or great-grand-father, and so for the rest, till we climbe up, as high, as to No<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>h himself? Whereupon it should follow, that not the Infants of Iewes, nor of Turks, no nor of Gentiles neither, should have baptism denyed them. Surely the grace of Christ must needs be universall, and wherein all have in­terest, if the seal thereof apperteyn unto all. Neither should the Church (amongst whose sacred furniture Baptism is) by this rule be any more the house of God, peculiar to his children and ser­vants; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1039"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=9">[Page 16]</a></span> but more like a common In, whose doore stands wide open to all that passe by the high way.</p><p>2. The Apostle 1 Corinth. 7, 14. upon this ground, that the one parent is a beleever, avoweth the childe <span class="hi">holy:</span> which otherwise he pronounceth <span class="hi">impure,</span> in respect of the Covenant, and holynes thereof (leaving unto God his secret judgments). Now what have the impure, and unhallowed to do with the holy things of God? And what hath the Pastour, and sheepheard in holy things to do with them, who are no portion of the Lords flock? <span class="hi">What have I to doe</span> (sayth the Apostle) <span class="hi">to judg them that are without? Do not ye judg them that are within?</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note29">1 Cor. 5, 12.</span> So (reverend brethren) what have you to do, to baptize them that are without? do you not baptize them that are within, and them alone? In the number of whom yet you reckon not those infants (though baptized by you) nor belonging to your charge. Whence also (God knoweth) it cometh to passe, for the most part, that they who are thus by you baptized into the name of the Lord, are by their godlesse parents education made the servants of Sathan.</p><p>3. The Baptism of Infants, in all soundnes of judgment, ser­veth, and that immediately for the comfort of their godly parents; whose hearts it filleth with no small joy, whilst they behould the gratious promise of God made to them and their seed, ratified and confirmed by this seal: even as of ould the circumcision of Isaak was granted, and injoyned by God unto Abraham his, and our fa­ther, first and immediately, for the confirmation of his fayth. Whence I conclude, that the seal of the righteousnes of faith (which baptism is) doth no more belong to the seed of godlesse parents, then doth the comfort flowing from the righteousnes of fayth un­to the parents themselvs. Whom as it would effectually move to more serious, and sad thoughts of their own estate with God, if they beheld their infants (so dear unto them) excluded thorough their default from the comfortable <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eal of Gods Covenant; so can they not but, by the undue administration of the same, take occasi­on of hardening themselvs in their accustomed perversnes.

Mat. 6, 6.</span> <span class="hi">To pray otherwise then Christ hath taught, is not onely ignorance, but guilt, seeing he himself hath sayd, you reject the precept of God, that you may observ your own tradition.</span> 3. Amongst the manie, and manifould prayers of the Apostles to be seen in the holy scriptures, this form of words is not found: and yet can it not be denyed, but they alwaies prayed as they were taught in this place by their Master Christ: whose meaning therefore it could not be to tye them necessarily to anie such certain of words. 4. It ap­pears by the context, that the purpose of Christ is to speak of pri­vate, or raither secret prayer, and such as everie Christian apart from others, and <span class="hi">in his closet,</span> with <span class="hi">the doore shut unto him,</span> should pour out unto the Lord. Now that one alone, and by himself should say, <span class="hi">Our father,</span> seems not verie congtuous.

And seeing that, as the Poet hath it, <span class="hi">the names do commonly suit with the things,</span> we may see, and sorrow withall, in the phrases in common use about this most Christian duetie of prayer, what it is with the unhallowed multitude of Christians to pray, namely <span class="hi">to say prayer, to read prayer, to hear prayer,</span> and raither any thing then in­deed to pray, that is, then to pour out the conceptions of a godly and devout minde unto God, from faith and feeling of our wants, by the holy Ghost.</p><p>2. We do affirm, that this form of words is unproperly, how commonly soever, called <span class="hi">the Lords prayer:</span> as neither being a prayer as it is the Lords, nor the Lords as it is a prayer. As it is of the Lord Christ, and so the Lords (whether by himself uttered in words, or committed to writing by his Euangel<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>sts) it hath the con­sideration, and respect of a sermon, and of Euangelicall doctrine, in which Christ taught his disciples; and not of a prayer put up to his Father: as on the contrarie it neither was, nor could be used prayer wise by Christ, in so manie words; with whose most persit sanctimonie it did not agree for him to say, <span class="hi">forgive us our trespasses.</span></p><p>3. We do firmly beleiv, that all, and everie both Church and person is bound alwayes to pray, as Christ hath there taught: whe­ther we respect the matter there propounded, or the affections there injoyned, or the commodious, and compend<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ous simplicitie, which Christ our Saviour, and onely mayster, there opposeth, both to the vain bablings, and oft repetitions of the heathens: and that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1494"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=12">[Page 22]</a></span> in these things, and them alone, the commandement of Christ doth consist, we both firmly beleiv, and confidently avow.</p><p>4. And lastly, we doubt not but that this verie form of words may be, and is rightly used in prayer unto God, provided there be neither opinion of necessitie, by which superstitious persons think themselvs stinted by the Lord to words, and sillables, nor of per­fection, by which many are of minde, that they have then at the last, and not before prayed per<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>itly, when they have repeated this form of words. And it is well, if some spot of this myre cleav not to the fingers of many ministers; which make it a matter of great conscience not to conclude their, and the churches prayers apply­ed specially to the present state of things, with this number, and measure of words. Which custom as it is used verie commonly, so in my judgment, with no great reason, for these two causes.</p><p>First, it seems to crosse all good order, and method, by which men should d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>scend from the more generall unto that which is more speciall: and not go the clean contrarie way, as in this they do.</p><p>Secondly, Since the rule, according to Phylosophie, and good reason, is alwaies before the thing ruled, and that this form is by Christ inst<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tuted, for this purpose, that it might be the rule, and squire of all our prayers,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note45">Tertull lib. de Ora<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> and as Tertullian saith, is <span class="hi">premised, as the foundation of all our accessorie d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>es,</span> me thinks the same should rai­ther be used in the first place; upon which as the same author hath it, <span class="hi">everie one should build the circumstances of his occasioned requests.</span></p><p>It remayneth that in a few words I answer that, which is by some objected touching those solemn blessings, at the first imparted by the Patriarks to their first born, and after by the Preists to <span class="hi">Israel the first born</span> of God.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note46">Exod. 4, 22.</span></p><p>And to let passe, 1. that the composers, and imposers of the Leyturg<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es now in use have not equall authoritie with Moses the man of God, not are th<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> writings any way comparable with his: 2.

I do answer this one thing, &amp; the same in Calvins words, viz. that <span class="hi">these blessings were not ordinarie prayers, but a lawfull author<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tie divinely interposed to testifie the grace of election:</span> which <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> also confirms by divers reasons. Neither can anie man who considers the words of the text make question, but that the Priests in <span class="hi">blessing (Israel,</span> not God) do direct their speach unto Israel by way of promise, and not unto God by way of prayer. <span class="hi">So blesse you</span> (saith Moses) <span class="hi">the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord blesse thee,</span> &amp;c. The same is to be judged of the salutations of the Apo­stles in their Epistles, (whereof they are a part, and so a part of the holy Scriptures): albeit yet they in them, as the Preists in their blessings, desired to have their truly loving affection taken know­ledg of by them to whom they wrote: and what good things they both desired at the hands of the Lord for them, and also promised them in his name.</p><p>2. We dislike all reading of prayer in the act of praying, as in­convenient, yea directly contrarie unto that act? In prayer we do pour out matter, to wit the holy conceptions of the minde, from within to without; that is, from the heart to God: on the contra­rie, in reading, we do receav and admit matter from without to within; that is from the book, into the heart. Let him that pray­eth do that which he doth, not another thing, not a divers thing. Let the whole man, and all that he is, both in soul and bodie, be b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nt upon God, with whom he converseth. The eyes of the minde are lifted to God in prayer; and why not the eyes of the bodie also? both which <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e that prayeth, by intending them upon a book, both depresseth, &amp; averteth from God.

Now the preparation unto prayer is verie unseasonable at the self­same time of the solemn performance thereof; and unreasonable in, and by the self same act.</p><p>3. Seeing that <span class="hi">publique prayer</span> (as Bucanus saith) <span class="hi">is a second part of the ministrie;</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note51">Bucanus cō m<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n places of prayer.</span> as also that amongst the gifts of the holie Ghost, wherewith the Pastor is indued from above, that is not small, not to be despised, by which he is able conveniently both for matter, and form, to conceav a prayer according to the churches present occa­sion;, and necessities; by the reading of this prescript form that (truly excellent) gift giuen of God for this end is made void, and of none use, and <span class="hi">the spirit</span> (contrarie to that which ought to be) <span class="hi">ex­tinguished.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note52">1 Thes. 5, 19.</span> <span class="hi">The manifestation of the spirit</span> (saith the Apostle) <span class="hi">is given to everie one</span> (especially to everie Pastour) <span class="hi">to profit withall.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note53">1 Cor. 12, 7.</span> But he who reads a form of prayer conceaved, and consigned by another, doth not manifest the pastorall gift, (for of the internall affection our question is not) of the spirit given to him to profit withall, but to that other by whom the form of prayer was ind<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ted.</p><p>4. If to read such a form of prayer be to pray aright, and pastour like no probable reason can be rendred, wherefore to read a ser­mon, or homilie, is not as well to preach aright, and as is required of the Pastour of the Church. Which so being, small reason had the Apostle,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note54">Act. 6.</span> treating of the ecclesiasticall ministerie, which princi­pally consists in these two exercises,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note55">2 Cor. 2, 16.</span> to crie out, as he did, <span class="hi">who is sufficient for these things?</span> For who is not sufficient even of the vul­gar sort? who can not read a Leiturgie, and an Homilie?</p><p>5. <span class="hi">The spirit</span> (saith the same Apostle,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note56">Rom. 8, 26.</span> speaking of all Christians) <span class="hi">helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what to pray, as we ought.</span> Yes, Paul, (with your l<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>av right well; for we have in our prayer-book, <span class="hi">what we ought to pray,</span> word for word, whether the spirit be pre­sent or not.

The same Apostle doth in the same place admonish,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note63"><span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. 28, 29, 30, 31.</span> and ex­hort the same Elders that they should <span class="hi">take heed unto themselvs, and to all the fl<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>k,</span> lest the same, <span class="hi">after</span> his <span class="hi">departure</span> should unhappily be damnified, either by <span class="hi">wolves entering in among them,</span> or such as should <span class="hi">rise up from themselvs speaking perverse things.</span> Now if the date of their Eldership, &amp; charge were shortly to be out, they might well think with themselvs, that the Apostles admonition for after times did not much concern them, whose term of office should so shortly be expired, and were perhaps to follow the Apostles depar­ture at the heeles.</p><p>3.

How much lesse lawfull is it for the Elders, or Deacons of the church (whose both condition, and mi­nisterie is far more excellent) for far lighter causes, to look back, and relinquish their vocation, wherein Christ hath in such sort pla­ced them?</p><p>A third thing there is, and that of most moment, viz. that the Elders do not administer their publique office publiquely, as they should, but onely in their private consistorie. And first, the admini­strat on of everie office doth <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n right follow the nature of the same; whether domesticall in the familie, or civill in the common wealth, or spirituall in the Church: the Elders office then being publique, requires answerable, and publique administrat on. Not that it is unlawfull for the Elders to convene, and meet apart from the bo­die, and to deliberate of such things as concerns the same, and so to do sundrie things by vertue of their office, but because that is not sufficient,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note67">Colos. 4, 17.</span> neither do they indeed <span class="hi">fulfill</span> their publique, and church-<span class="hi">office, office, which in the Lord they have receaved,</span> except as privately, and and in their consistorie, so also (and that specially) publiquely, and in the face of the congregation they exequute the same.</p><p>2.

Their pastours they do prosequute with due love, &amp; honour, out of their own certain knowledg of them and their work, but their Elders onely by hearsay.</p><p>Lastly,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note70">Act. 20, 17, 28.</span> the same Apostle warneth <span class="hi">the Elders of <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>phesus,</span> that they <span class="hi">attend &amp; take heed to the whole flock, in which they were made Bishops.</span> But it cannot be, that he should ministerially, as he ought, feed the whole church, whose voice the greatest part thereof never so much as once heareth.

And they are, the admitting of members into the church, upon profession of faith made, and the reproving and censuring of obstinate offenders, whether sinning publiquely, or privately with scandall. As we willingly leave the exequut on, and administration of these things to the Elders alone in the setled, and well ordered state of the church, so do we deny plainly, that they are, or can be rightly, and orderly done, but with the peoples pri­vat<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e and consent.</p><p>For the first, Christ the Lord gave in charge to his Apostles to preach in his name remission of sins, and therewith life eternall: and that such Iewes, or Gentiles, as should beleiv, and repent, viz. professe holily faith and repentance, (for to judg of the heart is Gods prerogative) they should receav into the fellowship of the Church, and baptize.

It was not so in Israel of ould, where by Gods appointment the Elders were to sit, and judg in the gates of the cittie: nor in the synagogues themselvs, from which manie are of minde, how truly I will not say, that the Chri­stian Eldership was derived, after the Roman tyrannie had confined into them the Iewes civill conventions, and judgments; nor in the primative church, no not in some ages after the Apostles, as might easily be proved out of Tertullian, Cyptian, and others, if I would trie the matter in that court:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note77">Aug<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>t of Ch<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> lib. 3.</span> but <span class="hi">it is much more safe,</span> as Austin saith, <span class="hi">to walke by the divine Scriptures.</span></p><p>And first the word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> church, originally Greek, answering to the Hebrew <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, doth primarily, and properly signifie a conven­tion of citizens called from their houses by the publ<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>que c<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>yer, ei­ther to hear some publique sentence or charge given: but translated to religious use, denoteth an assemblie of persons called out of the state of corrupt nature into that of supernaturall grace, by the pub­lishing of the gospell. Now the Elders, or presbyters (as such) are, and so are said to be, called, to wit, to their office of Eldership, but called out they are not, being themselvs to call out the church, and unto it to perform the cryers office. Neither do I think that the name Ecclesia, Church, hath been used by any Greek author, be­fore the Apostles times, or in their daies, or in the age after them for the assemblie of sole governers in the act of their government, or indeed before the same governers had seazed into their own, &amp; onely hands the churches both name and power.</p><p>But you will say, as learned men use to do, that these Elders su­steyn the person of the whole multitude, and supplie their room, for the avoiding of confusion; and so are <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ightly, as commonly called <span class="hi">The church representative.</span></p><p>I answer. First, no godly, no nor reasonable man will affirm, that this representation is to be extended to all the acts of religion, or indeed to others, then these, which are exercised in the govern­ing of the Church. What is it then? The Elders in ruling, and governing the Church must represent the people, and ocupie their place. It should seem then, that it appe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>teyns unto the people, un­to the people primarily, and originally (under Christ) to rule and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2299"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=16">[Page 31]</a></span> govern the church, that is, themselvs. But who will so say of a government not personall, but publique, and instituted, as the churches is?</p><p>2. If the Elders in their consistorie represent the church, then whatsoever they either decree, or do agreeing to the word of God whether respecting faith or manners, that also the church decreeth and doth, though absent, though ignorant both what the thing is, which is done, and upon what grounds it is done by the Elders: this being the nature of representations, that what the representing doth within the bounds of his commission, that the represented doth primarily, and much more, as but using the other for his in­strument. Now how dissonant this is to true faith and pietie, how consonant unto the Papists implicit faith, no man can be ignorant: and I had raither wise men should consider, then I aggravate.</p><p>3. The constant, and universall practise of the Apostles &amp; Apo­stolick churches do quite crosse this consistorian course. The Apo­stle Paul, well acquainted with the meaning of Christ, doth 1 Cor. 5. so reduce into practise, the rule and prescript of his maister Matth. 18. or to use the words of the Bishop of Chester,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note78">Bish of Win­ch<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>, ans<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span> to Tertus pa. 43.</span> <span class="hi">There commaunds to bring into practise this power, In the name of Christ, with his spirit,</span> as he seems to leav no place for doubting to him, who with diligence, and without prejudice, will compare together these two places, what the Lord meaneth, when he saith, <span class="hi">Tell the Church,</span> This our Apostle doth in that place reprove not the Elders or go­verners alone, but with them also the whole commonaltie and bo­die, for tolerating the incestuous person amongst them. Which therefore accordingly, as his authoritie Apostolicall,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note79">2 Ge<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>in. 11, 28.</span> and <span class="hi">care for all the churches</span> d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d require, he admonisheth, and directeth, that as mindefull both of the sinners repentance, and salvation, and there­with of their own puritie, they would exclude, by due order, that wicked man from their holy fellowship.

But we will annex certain reasons for the further clearing of the thing.</p><p>1.

But the fornicatour was not amongst the Elders alone, neither were they alone puffed up when they should have sorrowed, neither was that wicked man to be taken out of the midst of them, and still left in the midst of the people; and therefore not to be judged by them alone, but by the church with them, though governed by them.</p><p>2. It did not of ould apperteyn onely to the Levites and Elders in Israel,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note81">v. 1. 7.</span> to <span class="hi">purge out</span> of their houses the materiall <span class="hi">leven,</span> but to eve­rie father of familie also: so by proportion to the whole church now to purge out the leven spirituall there spoken of: which also could not <span class="hi">leven the whole lump,</span> or church, in the Apostles meaning, except it had concerned the whole church to purge it out.</p><p>3. The Apostle wrote not to the Elders onely, but with them to the whole bodie,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note82">i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s. 9.</span> <span class="hi">not to be commingled with fornicators, covet<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>us persons,</span> or the like, <span class="hi">called brethren:</span> he therefore admonisheth them, as the other,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note83">11.</span> to cast their stone at the incestuous man, for <span class="hi">the taking him away from the Lords people.</span></p><p>Manie more Arguments, and the same verie clear, might be drawn to this end, out of the text it self; but for brevitie sake I will omit them, and annex this onely one which followeth, from the second chapter of the second Epistle. The same Apostle writing to these same Corinthians about the same incestuous person, but now penitent, as before delinquent, seriously exhorts them, that look what severitie they had formerly shewed in censuring him for his sin, the like compassion they would now shew, in <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eceaving him again upon his repentance: therein plainly insinuateing, that this busines was not in the hands of the Elders alone, except we will say, that they alone were <span class="hi">made sad</span> by the Apostles reproof, that they alone by their <span class="hi">studie, defence, indignation, zeal,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note84">ch. 7, 9, 11. and 2, 7, 8.</span> &amp;c. <span class="hi">testified,</span> that they <span class="hi">were pure in the thing,</span> and except it belonged to them alone to <span class="hi">par­don,</span> and <span class="hi">comfort</span> the repentant sinner, and <span class="hi">to confirm their love unto him.</span></p><p>And whereas some would inclose this whole power within the Apostles circuit; as if he alone, Bishop-like, had passed sentence judicia<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ie upon the offender, and onely committed the declaration, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2471"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=17">[Page 33]</a></span> and publication of it in the church, to some his substitute, I deem it not lost labour breifly to <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>hew how erroneous this opinion is of externall monarchicall government, yea power also, which is more, in the church of Christ.</p><p>And, first, one alone, how great soever, cannot suffice to make the Church,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note85">See the Bishop of Church, an­swer to Tertus p. 41, 42.</span> or a congregation, which Christ hath furnished with power of <span class="hi">binding, and loosing</span> Math. 18, 17, 18. both reason, and scripture teaching, that for an assembly, and congregation at least <span class="hi">two or three</span> are required. ver. 19. <span class="hi">The Church (which name signifies a multitude, designeing by a new trope, one alone singular person,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note86">Whitakers of the authoritie of the Script. lib. 1.</span> as saith D.

It is expresly affirmed 2 Cor. 2, 6. that the incestuous per­son was <span class="hi">censured by many:</span> which <span class="hi">many</span> or more, the Apostle oppo­seth to himself alone, as appeareth by the context; and not <span class="hi">to all,</span> as some erroneously think.</p><p>3. The Apostle plainly, and sharply reproveth the Corinthians for that before his writing they had not voyded that sinfull man, their holy fellowship, and so prevented the reporte by which such a crime, and the same unpunished came to his ears. This their pow­er then the man of God doth not seaze into his own hands as for­feyt by their default in not using it, but vehemently (and as became a faithfull minister) exhorts and admonist<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es them to use it, as they ought <span class="hi">in the judging, purging out, and taking from among themselvs that wicked man,</span> and so any other <span class="hi">within,</span> or called <span class="hi">a brother,</span> sinning in the like manner.</p><p>4. If the Apostle Paul being absent from Corinth had excom­municated this sinner, then had he judicially condemned,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note87">See <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> chap. 2.</span> and judg­ed a man unaccused, unconvicted, and unreproved (at least face to face, and before his judg): then which what more unjust can be imagined of, or ascribed unto the holy Apostle?

In this busines the Apostles informe the church what kinde of men they ought to chuse: the multitude chuseth whom they judg fit, and meet accor­dingly; and the same present to the Apostles: upon whom so cho­sen by the people, the said Apostles impose hands as a solemn sym­bole of their consecration, joyning therewith common prayer.

That the same may be said in generall, of the Mosaicall cere­monies whatsoever: all, and everie one whereof affoardeth some­thing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3283"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=22">[Page 43]</a></span> morall. For instance, The Mosaicall Temple, or Tabernacle had this morall in it, and perteyning to us, as well as to the Israe­lites, that it was a fit and convenient place for the Church assembly. Is therefore the precept for the tabernacle as well morall,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note121">Exod. 25, &amp; 26. Exod. 20.</span> as that for the Sabboth? Is it alike a part of the decalogue, and morall law? Is it alike one of the ten Commandements?</p><p>2. If the morall sanctification of the Sabboth stand in this, that sometime be assigned to the publique ministerie, then were the Is­raelites, especially the preists, and Levites, bound to an everie day sabboth and sanctification morall,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note122">Num. 29, 38</span> being bound everie day <span class="hi">to offer</span> in the tabernacle, and temple, <span class="hi">two young lambs, the one at morning, the other at evening for a daylie sacrifice.</span></p><p>3. If the second precept of the Decalogue do in the affirmative part injoyn all outward instituted worship of God; then also by consequence it requi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es some set time (as a naturall circumstance ab­solutely necessarie to everie finite action) in which the same wor­ship is to be performed. In va<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n then is the fourth commandement, and to no purpose, if it injoyn nothing at all, but that which was injoyned before, namely in the second.</p><p>4.

The truly godly take some tyme for the exercises of Gods worship not onely publique, and Ecclesiasticall, but private also, and dome­sticall: yea in their <span class="hi">closets,</span> as Christ teacheth. Yet are not these either times, or places, in which such things are done, then others ar<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> ▪ Eyther therefore a day in it self must be holy, by divine institution, or the Decalogue is may<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ed in the fourth commandement.</p><p>But you will doubtlesse object the change made from the last daie, to the first day of the week.

As for example.

It is evident that this alteration was made both upon weigh­tie ground, and warrantable authoritie.

The reason is taken from the example of God himself, who rested the seventh day from the works of creation. The ends are, 1, that we framing our selvs to Gods example, after six daies spent in servile works, or works of acquisition, might rest the seaventh. 2. That we might recount with our selvs, not onely with thankfull, but also composed hearts, as the creation of man,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note133">1 Pet. 1, 3.</span> and of all other things for mans good, so al­so his re-creation, &amp; renovation clearly shineing in the resurrection of Christ from the dead. 3.

To let passe other things, how easily doth this thought steal into the heart not thoroughly perswa­ded of the holynes of this day? what now! There is in the day no holynes by Gods appointment, save onely, as in it, the publique sermons of the church with prayer, and thanksgiving are to be fre­quented, and performed: for me to be present at everie sermon, speciallie made in the cittie, both on the Lords day, and everie o­ther day of the week, my speciall calling, and worldly affairs will not permit: Besides, it were verie commodious for me on this Lords day, to make an end of such or such a work which I have in hand, to deal in such a busines, to undertake such a journey; And what should hinder me from so doing? But provided alwaies, up­on this condition, that look what this day wants, the morrow, or next day shall plentifully supply: or, if it so fall out, thorough mine importunate bu<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>sines, that I bee something more behinde this week in these things, I will certainly, and at the furthest, the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3676"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=24">[Page 47]</a></span> next week be so much the more frequent in them, and so make God, and my soul amends. And why (as is the guise of ill debters) will not men desire, and take longer day, even to months, and years also? considering how on the one side the heart of man is dayly faster taken &amp; held by the bait of worldly profit, and pleasure; and on the other, lesse affectioned to Gods holy word, by the lesse fre­quent hearing of it. And hence, alasse, cometh it to passe, that true pietie languisheth so much in the most, and with it such other christian vertues as use to accompanie it. Hence flow those tears of sorrow, and lamenting, which no true christian casting his eyes upon the reformed churches can forbear.</p><p>The third Reason is taken from that Apostolicall determination (wrested by many to a contrarie meaning) Coloss. 2, 16, 17.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note137">Colos. 2, 16. 17.</span> <span class="hi">Let no man therefore judg you in meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast or new moone, or sabbaths; which are the shadow of good things to come, but the bodie is Christ.</span> Whence it appeareth more then plainly, that onely those sabboths are abolished by Christs comeing in the flesh, which were types and figures of Christ to come, of which sort as there were not a few instituted of God by Moses, so doth this Apostle here, and elswhere sufficiently declare the abrogateing, and abolishing of the same by Christ. But that the Sabboth, of which we now speak comes in that reckoning we plainly deny.</p><p>For, 1. In its primary institution Gen. 2. there can nothing be found not wholy morall. Let a man haveing many e<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es as Argus, search the same with a candle, he seekes (as we say) a knot in a bul<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ush, if he think to find in it any either shadow of Christ, or shadow of shadow. If any shall except, that God by Moses did enjoyn unto the Israelites the sanctification of this day, <span class="hi">that it might be a signe between him, and Israel throughout their generations,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note138">Exod. 31, 13.</span> <span class="hi">that they might know, that he is the Lord that doth sanctifie them,</span> I do an­swer, first, in the words of Arminius,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note139">Armin. in theol. disp. pr<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>v. p. 186, 187.</span> that <span class="hi">the Reason upon which God did afterwards commend unto his people, the sanctification of the sabboth because it was a signe between God and his people, that it was Iehovah that sanctified them, may be applyed to the times of the new testament, &amp; further with them also the sabboths sanctification.</span> 2. Admit that this use were ceremoniall, and typicall in the fourth comman­dement, yet were there no force in the consequence from one end <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3722"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=25">[Page 48]</a></span> &amp; use typicall, and ceremoniall, superinduced, and brought in up­on the precept, to prove the precept it self ceremoniall, and ty­picall in the institution. By the same reason it may be affirmed, that both the Covenant of God made with Abraham, <span class="hi">I will be thy God,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note140">Gen. 49, 3.</span> <span class="hi">and the God of thy seed,</span> as also <span class="hi">the right of the first born,</span> for a double port on, &amp; manie things more of like consideration, were merely ceremoniall, and typicall, seeing that even unto them also, were annexed, and that by Gods appointment, divers typicall, and temporall respects:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note141">Gal. 3. 8, 16, 17.</span> of which notwithstanding none soundly minded will deny, that the one is euangelicall, and the other na­turall. 3. Considering that the observation of this sabboth was either injoyned (as I perswade my self it was from Gen. 2, 1, 2, 3. &amp; Exod. 16, 26, 30.) to Adam, in innocency and not yet needing Christ; or at least, that the reason of the institution did fit the state of innocencie as well, as it did the Israelites afterward I doe undoubtedly conclude, that the same Sabboth in the primarie, and essentiall institution thereof is not to come upon their file, which as <span class="hi">the shadows of future things</span> had <span class="hi">Christ for the body.</span></p><p>Fourthly, I argue from that premonition of Christ Math. 24, 20. <span class="hi">Pray that your flight be not in winter nor on the Sabboth.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note142">Mat. 24, 20</span> I am not ig­norant how the most divines both ancient, and later do under­stand <span class="hi">this sermon</span> (as Chrisostom saith) as <span class="hi">made of the Iewes;</span> seeing that,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note143">Chrisost ho<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> 77. <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Mat. 24.</span> as the same authour hath it, <span class="hi">neither the Apostles did observ the Sabboth day, neither yet were they in Iudea when these things were done of the Romans: many of them having departed this life, and the rest (if anie survived) having bestowed themselvs in other places.</span> But (with due reverence to them all be it spoken) it seemeth by the text to be otherwise.

Secondly, our Saviour in saying <span class="hi">Pray ye,</span> makes it plain, that that he speaks of them, and their associates unto whom he speakes, to wit, Christians. Lastly how could it be that Christ, who by his death (now drawing so neare as that there was but a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3807"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=25">[Page 49]</a></span> step unto it) was to abrogate, and abolish all Iewish ceremonies, and shadowes, should to carefully provide for the so religious ob­servation of a shadowish, and ceremoniall sabboth: and that not for a day or two, but for so many yeares after the same his death; Could anie thing more weightie be spoken by Christ, or which could more deeply imprint in the hearts of men a religious regard of the Sabboth, then that it behooved them to obte<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n by prayer at Gods hands, that they might not be const<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eined unto that thing although permitted them of God in case of urgent necessitie, which might violate and interrupt the publique, and solemn sanc­tification thereof; It is true then which Chrisostome saith, that <span class="hi">the Apostles did not observ the Sabboth,</span> to wit, Iewish: but the Chri­stian Sabboth, o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Lords day</span> they did undoubtedly celebrate.</p><p>The fift and last Reason may be fetcht from the verie Gentiles themselvs, who directed by the glimps of the light of nature, how darkly soever shineing in them, had their holy daies, and some of the same such, as in which not so much as the pleading,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note145">Var <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span></span> and deter­mining of suites were admitted.

God forbid, that we should not ac­knowledg that, &amp; withall, that infinite thanks for the same are due to Gods great power &amp; goodnes, both in respect of our selvs and others: Who notwithstanding the great confusion, both of persons, and things <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5732"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=3102&amp;page=36">[Page 71]</a></span> there to be found, vouchsafeth to his elect so plentifull grace, cover­ing under the vayl of his superaboundant goodnes &amp; mercy, by their <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ncere fayth in Christ Iesus, their sins &amp; aberrations, whether of ig­norance, or infirmitie. What then must be done? <span class="hi">should we continue in sin, that grace might abound?</span> or shall we against knowledg go on to walk inordinately, because in our ignorance God hath vouchsafed us of his grace in that disordered state of things? without the ministerial church (of which we speak) the preaching of the gospell both may, &amp; useth to be had, &amp; by it sayth to be ingenerated, except christian churches be to be gathered of infidels &amp; unbeleevers. Besides, what Minos, or Rha­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>amant will deny, that even in the bosom of the Romish church some fa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>thfull persons may be found? how much more in that of England, in which the main truths of the gospell, the most &amp; greatest errours of poperie being banished, are taught by so manie godly &amp; learned men, with such zeal, and earnestnes? Now what of these things? Is it there­fore lawfull for a Christian, eyther to content himself with himself, without joyning to any christian congregation; or to continue still in the bosom of the church of Rome, as a member under the Pope th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> head?
