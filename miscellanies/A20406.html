But what auailes it to be inueſted with a diademe &amp; want delight? When the date of my nonage was expired, hee deſirous to linke me in ſome honou­rable alliance, determined to prouide a wife with an ample dowrie, and large hopes of future good haps. Many Prin­ces of <span class="hi">Ionia,</span> and Péeres of <span class="hi">Europe,</span> deſirous to inſert them­ſelues into ſo royall a kinred, and to haue intereſt in ſo noble a Familie, offered their daughters with large por­tions. But onely the Prince of <span class="hi">Lemnos</span> ſped in his ſuite, whoſe allyance my Father accepted, ſhadowing his pre­tence which was aymed at hoped profit, for the match was concluded with this condition, that if the Prince dyed without heire Male (as he then had none, nor may by any likelihoode hope of any) then the enioying of his eſtate, and poſſeſſion of his Crowne, ſhould in right of his daugh­ter deſcend to mée. This compact thus ſubtilly contriued, was by agréement of both our Parents confirmed, ſo that nothing wanted to finiſh the bargaine and ſtrengthen the contract, but my conſent, whereof my Father ſeeming to conceiue no doubt, made me priuie to his proceedings, commanding me to deliuer my reſolution in briefe and playne tearmes. I, who miſliking his choiſe, would not conforme my thoughts to an others direction, perceiuing the old mans drift, yet diſſembling my intent, anſwered <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e757"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> in effect thus, that my yeares were fewe, my experience ſmall, my affections frée, a ſole life beſt fitting my fancie. Yet did I in humilitie ſubmit me to his diſpoſing, onely crauing a little reſpit to ſummon my ſenſes, and conceite a change, deſiring him to impute the not liking of ſo ho­nourable an eſtate, to the imperfections of my youth. He ſuſpecting no fraude in theſe faire ſpeaches, thought it ſufficient that I was ſo flexible, and referd the times appointment to mine owne choiſe. But I déeming nothing more diſhonourable then to meaſure affection by money, or leuell the eye, fancies herault, at a gainefull, though inglorious obiect, pronounced lucre an hereſie in loue, and eſtéeming ſuch mercenary thoughts méeter for a pea­ſant than a Prince, would rather neuer marry then ſo marre. For ſhould I wed mine owne woe? Should I ac­cept her a ſpouſe, whoſe beautie I beheld not, whoſe beha­uiour I knewe not, of whoſe worth I was vncertaine, be­cauſe it was vnſéene? How could that loue be conſtant, that affection permanent, which had no déeper roote then the parents naked conſent, no ſurer ſeale then a bare ſalu­ting at the firſt fight? Yet, (ſuch was the inclination of my youth) I earneſtly deſired to fixe my fancy on ſome fortunate obiecte worthie of a Princes fauour. Many both gorgeous and gallant Dames attended in my Fathers Court, yet none fit, though all faire. While fancy com­menced ſuch tumults in my thoughts, there arriued in <span class="hi">Cyprus</span> a noble Epirote, ſurnamed <span class="hi">Ariſtophon,</span> a man noble in déede, graced with all ornaments which nature might afford, or vertue challenge. He was baniſhed from his natiue ſoyle by tyrannous doome of his vnnaturall Souereigne, being falſely accuſed to attempt an innoua­tion in the State, and plot ſome treacherous practiſe with the King of <span class="hi">Macedon.</span> For it was vniuſtly ſurmiſed by ſome, and beléeued by all, that he had conſpired to betray to him the countrey of <span class="hi">Ambracia,</span> whereof he was Preſi­dent, and had annexed it by force of Armes to the Crowne <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e792"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> of <span class="hi">Epirus.</span> Although his integritie ſhould haue cleared him from ſuch a crime, yet, (as it commonly happens) in­nocencie oppreſſed by iniurie could not preuaile: leauing therefore his vnkinde countrey, deſpairing of returne, yet bearing with manlike patience the burthen of his exile, he repaired to my Fathers Court, who reléeued him with princely liberalitie, allowing him an honourable penſion for maintenance of his eſtate: for hauing oft employd him in weightie affaires, and finding him fortunate in at­chieuements, he perceiued by theſe experiments that he was garniſhed with all glories of nobilitie, graue in coun­ſell, valiant armes: of dauntleſſe courage, ſpotleſſe truth. But leauing this digreſſion, I will returne to the propo­ſed entent of my diſcourſe. Hée brought with him his daughter and onely childe named <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> a creature endued with ſuch ornaments of the bodie, graced with ſuch qualities of the minde, that it ſeemed nature and ver­tue concurring in one, had conſpired to make her a péere­leſſe proofe-péece of their vnited perfections: and though fortune fretting at their fauours ſo largely beſtowed ſought to croſſe their courteſies with her cruelties, yet could ſhe not blemiſh the bright-ſhining worth of ſo fa­mous a wonder. But as a ſmall cloude in a cleare day may ſomewhat ſtayne, not wholy ſtop the Sunnes light, ſo fortunes malice did rather darken then drowne her merits, in whoſe Iuory browes Chaſtitie ſate enthronizde as gardian of her lookes, Modeſtie teinting her chéekes with a vermilian dye of Virgin-red maiden-bluſhes, em­blaſond her a map of mirrors. Maieſtie whiche beautie claymed, birth challenged, loue commaunded, guided her geſtures with ſuch decent proportion, as <span class="hi">Iuno</span> wanted in the pride of her glorie, or <span class="hi">Minerua</span> in the prime of her pompe. Theſe gifts theſe glories did ſo enchaunt, enthrall, enforce me, that hauing ſcarce viewde her, I vowde her mine, or my ſelfe not mine owne, ſuch déepe impreſſions were wrought in mine affections. Loue hauing wonne <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e824"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> and wounded me with mine owne weapons, finding an eaſy entrance into mine heart through mine eyes, the au­thors of my diſeaſe, and diſcouerers of my deſire, diſgari­ſond my thoughts of wonted fancies, conuerting my ſo­lace into ſobs, my delights into deſpaire. I vnable to ſu­ſteine ſo grieuous a burthen, perceiuing that the more I ſtroue to allay the heate, the more thoſe ſmothered cinders reuiude in quenchleſſe flames, Flames which <span class="hi">Aetna</span>-like boild in my breſt, reſembling the horrors of Mount <span class="hi">Ghi­belloes</span> firie rage, which vomits millions of vapors, and darts heapes of ſulphur from the glowing centre, being I ſay torturde with troubles, I reſolued to finde eaſe for my loue, or end for my life, ſuing to her bountie which had vn­done me by her beautie. I am ſo briefe in relating my for­tunes, as I was then loth to defer the execution of mine enterpriſe that ſo highly concernd the hope of my good hap. Finding her on a time in company with other, I ſingled her from the reſt, my intent not ſuſpected by any. When we were alone, I hauing awhile dallyed with common deuiſes to enterteine her with varietie of talke, in the end though I could not Orator-like paynt my paſſions in figu­ratiue tearmes, nor contriue them with rhetoricall con­ceipts, yet did I playnely diſcouer my affection, proteſting my preſent loue, vowing my future loyaltie, producing cauſes, deſiring comfort, alleadging her worth, my wants, ſeaſoning my words with many ſighes. She in a cho­lerike humor (but it was a pretty choler) framde a cour­teous yet cruell anſwere, courteous in her words, enterla­ced with reuerent ſpeaches, cruell in that vnkinde repulſe, yet kinde rebukes, not omitting to inſert the reſpect of her owne honor, and the regard of her fathers ſafetie: but concluding her friendly anger in a calmer veine, ſhe prof­fered in ſubmiſſion all ſeruice loue excepted and her ho­nour reſerued. Although the laſt clauſe afforded ſufficient matter for a freſh reply, yet did her conſtancie ſo confound me, that being vnable to vtter one word, I brake off our <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e863"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=10">[Page]</a></span> parle abruptly, and ſummoning my fancies to a retreate, I reſolued to attempt a ſecond onſet, wherein being like­wiſe vanquiſhed by her vertues, yet rather animated then amated (theſe kinde conflicts kindling not quenching my flaming paſſions) I attached a third onſet: but hauing therein receiued a ſharper foyle, I proceeded to a fourth, of all moſt fatall, for ſhe taunted me with contemptuous tearmes, and yéelding a full denyall, ſealed with a ſtorme of frownes, ſhe departed, leauing me amid my diſcon­tent plunged in a ſea of dangerous conceipts, muſing on my miſhaps, meditating on her rigor, deſperate of all hope, deſtitute of all delights: but my paſſions were ſuch that I could not conceale them vndiſcouered: ſuch my ſorrows, that I could not ſmother them in ſilence: thus therefore I vtt<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>red part of my griefe in an extemporall Sonet.</p><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><div class="sonnet" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_q.1_floatingText.1_body.1_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head">Arisbas his Sonet.</span></h3><div class="lg"><div class="l">SHould I accuſe mine eyes that boldly gazed</div><div class="l">On that fayre obiect not to be obteyned,</div><div class="l">Or blame the worth in Europes wonder blazed,</div><div class="l">That them to looke and me to loue conſtreyned?</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Eyes for excuſe alleadgde preuailing reaſon,</div><div class="l">Heart in extreames on fancies wrong exclaymed:</div><div class="l">Hopes ſun-ſhine clowded like obſcureſt ſeaſon,</div><div class="l">Yeelds to deſpeire at my misfortunes aymed.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Nature too lauiſh outward graces planted,</div><div class="l">Vertue too friendly inward bounties ſowed:</div><div class="l">Yet thoſe faire eyes of courteous looks are ſcanted,</div><div class="l">And angels hue on tygres thoughts beſtowed.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Tuſh, loue which not alike did wound vs both,</div><div class="l">Is cauſe, that I my death-like life doe loath.</div></div></div></div></div><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e916"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span>But not ſatiſfyed thus to haue expreſſed my ſorrowe, I did in an odder veine pen an Elegie without methode or good matter, but as it was I will rehearſe it.</p><div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><div class="elegy" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_q.2_floatingText.1_body.1_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head">Arisbas his Elegie.</span></h3><div class="l">FAint wel I may for I feele enfeebling faintnes about me,</div><div class="l">faintnes vpon my lims heart to beſet to beſot.</div><div class="l">Loue is a God but a cruell God but a boy but a wanton</div><div class="l">blinde but boldly triumphs, proud to be tearmd a tyran.</div><div class="l">What ſhal I do?

This melancholy (whereof I ſpake before) procured a grieuous maladie, which ſhe at the firſt ſuppoſed feigned, knowing that I would plot all ſleights, and leaue no ſubtilties vnaſſaide to circumuent her, but when the Phyſicions report, my Fathers ſorrowe, the generall rumor bruted through the Courte had aſſured her of mine eſtate, ſhe thinking it enough to cauſe but too much to continue my danger, came with her Father to viſit me. How then I was affected, I refer to their cenſures whoſe fortunes haue reſembled mine. All the powers of my bodie being tranſferd into mine eyes the contriuers of my then-ſéeing diſcontent, were employed in viewing her outward glories, and va­luing her inward graces. When I remembred her laſt tearmes, I trembled at each thought, but weighing that being endued with all vertues, ſhe could not want that of clemency hauing the other of courteſie nor be voide of gentleneſſe being garniſhed with far-deriued gentilitie, I ſuppoſed this the fitteſt time to ſpéede if now I ſpake. When her father tooke leaue, I craude his daughters longer preſence vnder pretence of paſſing away the time, ſhe not vnwillingly aſſented though ſmelling the drift of my demaund, and he both accepted and ratified my re­queſt, commaunding her to tarrie. When we were alone, I pleaded in effect thus, though not ſo boldly as before, Firſt, I alleadged that my preſent ſickneſſe ſo dangerous, my former vowes ſo ſerious, might warrant the truth of mine vnfeigned paſſions. Next, that I meant not to diſho­nour her by affecting her, ſith I craude onely to make her my lawfull ſpouſe, which fauor if ſhe would vouchſafe to afforde, I vowed to incurre all hazards for the preſeruing of her honor, proteſting to leaue <span class="hi">Cyprus,</span> to fruſtrate the pretended mariage with the Prince of <span class="hi">Lemnus</span> his daugh­ter, and liue with her the onely bliſſefull heauen of my <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> life, and ſtay of mine happineſſe, as baniſht in ſome other countrey till my Fathers anger were appeaſed and his conſent obteyned, whoſe royall eſtate to me as eldeſt by right belonging, when I ſhould by ſucceſſion in that farre-renowned Kingdome fully enioy, I promiſed to inueſt her with a Diademe, and Crowne her Quéene of my coun­trey, as ſhe was already ſouereigne of my content. I en­ded my plaints with an humble petition, deſiring her to pittie mine eſtate, accept my ſeruice, and compaſſionate my ſorrowes, ſith in loue-diſeaſes they onely can heale which cauſde the hurt. She ſhowring a ſtreame of ſiluer-teares from thoſe chriſtall fountaines bright lamps of loues light, ſuch as might beſeeme <span class="hi">Venus</span> to ſhead on her déere <span class="hi">Adonis, Aurora</span> on her Sonne <span class="hi">Memnon,</span> ſhapt this anſwere.</p><p>Pardon (deareſt Lord) the follies of a ſelly mayde, or rather weigh with indifference the cauſes of her coyneſſe, for ſo you tearme my denyall, which if folly had effected, or diſdeigne cauſed, I had merited more blame then a world of puniſhments might expiate. But ſith the reſpect of my Fathers ſafetie, and the regard of mine owne ho­nour moued me to be ſo rigorous in my replyes, I hope to finde the more fauour in the offer of my ſatiſfaction, which with all ſubmiſſion I humbly preſent.

Being loth to defer time, or dally with fortune, I obſerued this order in per­fourmance of my plotted enterpriſe. Diſguiſing my ſelfe, I went on an euening t<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>he Hauen (for the Court was then kept at <span class="hi">Famagoſta</span>) there I met with a <span class="hi">Rhodian,</span> which hauing ſhipt his fraught, was readie to hoiſe ſayle, and determined to touch in the maine of <span class="hi">Greece</span> before his arriuall at <span class="hi">Rhodes.</span> Conferring with him a while of triuiall matters, in the end I diſcloſed my purpoſe, fei­ning my ſelfe an <span class="hi">Arcadian,</span> and that my Father enforced to flye his countrey, had long liued in <span class="hi">Cyprus,</span> ſpending the remnant of his life in baniſhment with mée and my poore ſiſter (for ſo I tearmed <span class="hi">Timoclea</span>) his vnhappy chil­dren, the hopeleſſe companions of his exile, that being now dead, he left vs ſéely Orphanes, and to vs ſuch ſmall ſubſtance as hée had, that wée bereaued by death of our deareſt comforte, not knowing howe to mainteine our ſelues in a ſtrange place with ſo ſmall a portion, were deſirous to reuiewe our natiue ſoyle, and returne to our deceaſſed fathers friends.

Thus the bargaine being ſolemnly knit betwéene vs, hée wilde mée that I ſhould come with my ſuppoſed Siſter the next night very late, béeing the time prefixed for his departure, and tolde me ſecretly in friendly ſort, as one ſtranger to an other, that hée had aboord certayne vnlawfull and vncuſtomed wares, the ſale whereof would be very gaynefull to him, but if it were reuealed, would worke his vtter vndoing, which cauſed him attempt meanes to launch thence by ſtealth. Nothing could chance more <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eſpondent to my wiſh, who deſired to depart priuily. Leauing him therefore and returning to the Court, I repaired to <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> certified her of my procéedings in all points, willed her to remem­ber her vowed promiſe and plighted faith, enfourmed her of all things néedefull to be done. She not failing mine expectation, promiſed her readineſſe at the appointed time. I leauing her, packt ſuch treaſure as I could gather in haſte, and attended the aſſigned houre, which being come, taking her with me, I came to the Hauen, and béeing ſpéedily conueyed aboord, found all things ready, anchors weighed, ſayles ſpread at our comming: within ſhort ſpace we got out of the Hauen, and before morning were farre enough from the coaſt of <span class="hi">Cyprus.</span> Foure dayes wée ſayled merrily, hauing a luſty gale in the poope, which draue vs gallantly forward. On the fift day towards eue­ning we deſcryed land, the ſhores delightfull hue affoor­ding vs a pleaſant proſpect. Our maiſter iudging it ſome part of <span class="hi">Greece,</span> ſuppoſing that I which had feinde my ſelfe natiue in the continent, could not be ignorant of the coaſt, deſired me to goe on ſhore, ſearch the land, and bring him word whether I knewe the countrey. I of all moſt deſi­rous to leaue the ſea, fearing purſuite of my fathers po­wer, condeſcended to his requeſt. Being ſet on land, pa­cing vp and downe a while, I was drowned in viewe of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1111"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=13">[Page]</a></span> thoſe delights which that fertile ſoyle yéelded, déeming that it was <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> or ſome place bordering on it, partici­pating like pleaſures with it. Then began I to conceit varieties of imagined bliſſe, iudging this a fit place for mée and my <span class="hi">Timoclea</span> to reſt in a while, till ſhe had reco­uered her health, being much impaired by her ſea-iour­ney. Hetherto Fortune ſéemed friendly to mine attempts, but now, leaſt ſhe ſhould be vnlike her ſelfe, ſhe obſcurde the ſun-ſhine of my happineſſe with clouds of her incon­ſtancie, for the wauering Goddeſſe doomd my ſolace to be thwarted with eternall ſorrowes. In a moment the windes rayſing the Sea in billowes, ſecluded mée from returne. He which attended my comming in the Boate, fearing to be intercepted by the ſtorme, rowed backe in haſte, leauing me, yet did hée hardly eſcape drowning. I though too late weighing the weathers change, haſted backe, but miſſed the Boate, and him that guided it. Then I beheld the Ship toſſed amid thoſe tempeſtuous waues, ſometimes hoiſed to heauen, preſently plunged in the <span class="hi">Oceans</span> deapth. Accurſed eyes the vnhappy beholders of my deareſt <span class="hi">Timocleas</span> troubles whereof ſhe was vn­worthy, I too worthy which brought her to this perill, for whoſe danger drouping more then dreading mine owne, I made ſignes to them aboord, which anſwered me with the like, intimating as I did gueſſe their deſire and readi­neſſe to take me in when the ſtorme ſhould ceaſſe. I ſomewhat comforted with this colde hope, ſate downe néere the ſhore looking for a calme. Dayes light decli­ning, nights darkeneſſe ſhadowed the earth, but in this obſcuritie of all things I continued my abode, expecting dayes returne. But when <span class="hi">Phoebus</span> poſting from the <span class="hi">An­tipodes</span> had remounted the Eaſterne hill, and burniſhed heauen with his glittering beames, I hoping to ſee my wiſhed obiect, viewed onely the voyd Sea. What ſhould I then do? exclaime? I did it: accuſe? whome? the Gods? I would not: Fortune? I durſt not, for I hoped her fa­uour <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1152"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> might be regayned. But ay me, my hope was force­leſſe, becauſe fruteleſſe. The windes fury was aſſwaged, but no Ship ſéene, no hope of returne. I ſpent the ſecond night in this booteleſſe expectation, which being paſt, and day reſtored, I ſummond my thoughts to conſult, and de­termind ſith vaine ſorrowe without ſearch could not a­uayle, to ſéeke her my loſt loue, and finde her if the earth affoorded her. Riſing in this reſolution, and haſting by the coaſt, hauing mine eyes alwayes towards the Sea, I came to a deſolate and almoſt diſpeopled Hauen, where finding a <span class="hi">Cretan</span> Pinneſſe ready rigd, and furniſhed for departure, I ſpéedily embarqued my ſelfe therein, but neither in my paſſage at Sea, nor in my ſearch on land after my arriuall, could I finde any certaintie of my de­ſire. Paſſing thence by Ship to <span class="hi">Rhodes,</span> I had like ſuc­ceſſe, for expecting there moſt comfort, I found leaſt con­tent. Though there diſcouraged, yet I drouped not, but proceeded: no Ile in the <span class="hi">Ionian</span> or <span class="hi">Aegaean</span> Seas was by me vnſéene or vnſearched. Failing in theſe, I came by Sea to <span class="hi">Helleſpont,</span> thence to <span class="hi">Epirus,</span> thence to <span class="hi">Ma­cedon,</span> then forward into <span class="hi">Theſſaly,</span> from <span class="hi">Theſſaly</span> to <span class="hi">Thrace,</span> enquiring diligently in all the Port townes of theſe Prouinces, and not finding any comfort, not hea­ring any newes of what I moſt deſired, I entred into <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> and met happily with you amid my laments. Thus haue you heard the ſumme of my ſorrowes briefe­ly related, whereto if you can affoord ſuch eaſe as I expect, you ſhall not onely ſaue the life and ſalue the ho­nour of a diſtreſſed Prince, but make him of all moſt fortunate.

Yet if the ſequele of my report doe in any ſort ſatiſfye you, I requeſt that the ſolace which you get thereby, may in part recompence thoſe former defects.</p><p>When our laſt <span class="hi">Autumne</span> the yeares moſt deſired ſea­ſon, had rendered Earths tribute with heaped plentie of encreaſe, <span class="hi">Aegon</span> and <span class="hi">Damaetas,</span> both <span class="hi">Arcadians,</span> by pro­feſſion Shepheards as I am, walking on the downes not farre from the Sea, while <span class="hi">Titan</span> poſting to plunge his firie Chariot in <span class="hi">Thetis</span> lappe had gladded <span class="hi">Oceanus</span> with his returne, walking I ſay and ouerlooking their Swaynes that gathered the flockes to pen them in the foldes, they ſawe a farre off one running towards them, ſéeming by ſignes to requeſt their tarriance. At his approach they behelde him a goodly youth of comely feature, and endued with ſuch rare beautie, as is ſéel­dome ſéene in any of our ſexe. The ſelly lad breathleſſe with running, ſpeachleſſe, and almoſt heartleſſe through feare, fell downe at their féete. They hauing graunted him ſome reſpit to ſettle and recouer himſelfe, gently tooke him vp and courteouſly demaunded his eſtate, and the cauſe of his ill hap. He which panting for breath ſtop­ped oft in his tale, and could not make a long diſcourſe, briefely told them, that hauing by hard fortune left his Countrey, he was taken by Pirats, amongſt whome he had long led a miſerable life, being moſt barbarouſly handled, they ſometimes alluring him with faire promi­ſes, ſometimes terrifying him with ſharpe menaces, but no way able to winne him to their wills, or moue him to ſatiſfye their beaſtly luſt. Oft he curſed his worthleſſe beautie, ſo he tearmed it, that had cauſed that wretched bondage, wherein he had endured ſo many troubles, con­tinuing reſolutely in his chaſt conſtancie. Thus much he diſcouered, and deſired them to queſtion no farther of his eſtate, but earneſtly beſought one of them, whome <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1256"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> it ſhould ſo pleaſe, to enterteyne him as his ſeruant, and promiſed to doe his duetie with all deuoire of dili­gence. <span class="hi">Aegon</span> the wealthier of the two, a man of ap­prooued honeſtie enterteined him, tooke him home, and ſince that time hath vſde him not as a ſeruant but a ſonne, for hauing no childe he purpoſeth to make him his heire. When the fame of this wonder, and the fortune of his arriuall was bruted through the countrey, <span class="hi">Aegons</span> houſe was frequented with troupes of <span class="hi">Arcadians</span> luſty Gal­lants, and dainty Girles.

Thus was this wonder admired of all, loued of Shepheards, and liked of Laſſes. Happy ſéemed the Swayne that could enioy his company, prowde was the Girle that could for a louers glaunce receiue a friendly looke. Among the reſt, <span class="hi">Dorylus</span> an Heard-man, doting more déepely then became a Neateheard, aſſaying all meanes poſſible, yet finding no meanes poſſible to compaſſe his deſire, at laſt reſolued to woe him with offers, try him with preſents, and tempt him with gifts: for déeming loue a couetous humor, hée thought this the onely point for his purpoſe. Béeing in ſo odde a veyne, preſuming to fore­ſée his owne ſucceſſe, he plotted his ſuppoſed fortune in a Poeme, which béeing common in euery Shepheards mouth, I will nowe recite, that you may iudge howe cunningly he could contriue his fancy in a fiction.</p><div class="q"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1291"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> <div class="floatingText"><div class="floatingText_body"><div class="poem" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_q.3_floatingText.1_body.1_div.1"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head">Cupids iourney to Hell.</span></h3><div class="lg"><div class="l">LOue leauing heau'n gan poſt to Stygian lake,</div><div class="l">And being landed on the farther ſhore,</div><div class="l">For Plutoes palace did his iourney make,</div><div class="l">To view his vncles Court and royal ſtore.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Thus hauing crept from mothers ſight by ſtealth,</div><div class="l">He welcom'd is with pompe by bloodleſſe ghoaſts:</div><div class="l">And hels grim tyran greeting him with health,</div><div class="l">His royalties to powre-full nephew boaſts.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Hauing viewd each ſtrange hue of monſtrous ſhape,</div><div class="l">They feaſted with great iollitie in hell:</div><div class="l">And ſawc'd their meate with ſtore of preſſed grape,</div><div class="l">Till wine did wit and ſenſe from them expell.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Sleepe cauſde by fumes to their ore-charged braines,</div><div class="l">Did ſeaze on both: firſt Pluto tooke a nap:</div><div class="l">Next, Cupid (thus his quaffing moode conſtraines)</div><div class="l">Laie downe to reſt him, dreading no miſhap.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">In haſt the fondling from his ſhoulders threw,</div><div class="l">His deare bought quiuer and his fatall bowe:</div><div class="l">Faire Proſerpine came in and at the view,</div><div class="l">Forthwith exclaimde, theſe, theſe haue wrought my woe.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Theſe, theſe cauſde me depriude of wonted ioy,</div><div class="l">T'inhabit Hell theſe firde the leachers luſt:</div><div class="l">But ſith they are miſguided by a boy,</div><div class="l">I will commit them to an others truſt.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">This ſaid, came Plutus headlong tumbling in,</div><div class="l">Plutus the god of Coyne blinde as the other:</div><div class="l"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1359"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></span>Whom with faire words the guilefull queene did win,</div><div class="l">T'vſurpe thoſe gifts and ſeeme loues ſecond brother:</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">At firſt he fearde, at laſt he was delighted,</div><div class="l">With vſing them and ſmiled oft to thinke:</div><div class="l">How mens affections by thoſe ſhafts excited,</div><div class="l">Obeide his doome which loue with gold did linke.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Cupid awaking miſſ'd the dreaded ſignes</div><div class="l">Of godheads might: ſtrange paſſions did him toſſe:</div><div class="l">He wreathes his armes in folds and them vntwines,</div><div class="l">Thus childiſhly he mones his hapleſſe loſſe.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">He wept, he fled, in hell he durſt not hide him,</div><div class="l">Grieude with the murmure of ſo many ſoules,</div><div class="l">Neere heau'n he dares not come leaſt Venus chide him.</div><div class="l">What ſhould he do whom Fortune thus controules?</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Foule fall the wagge that loſt ſo rare a iewell</div><div class="l">Long may he lurke that could no better gard</div><div class="l">His fathers toile, his mothers pride, the fewell,</div><div class="l">Which for hearts wracke, eyes glaunſes haue preparde.</div></div><div class="lg"><div class="l">Sith then the god of gaine vſurps loues roome,</div><div class="l">I will with gifts make ſute for gracious doome.</div></div></div></div></div></div><p>You may perhaps doubt the coherence of this deuiſe, thinking it ſtraunge that <span class="hi">Plutus</span> ſtumbled in headlong at that inſtant, no former cauſe of his haſtie comming being pretended: but marke my briefe report, which being heard, his inuention may ſéeme plauſible.</p><p>In this the laſt and worſt time wherein men carry gol­den thoughts though it be an iron age, <span class="hi">Plutus</span> perceiuing the generall deſire of wealth ſetled in all hearts, thought himſelfe ſo great a god as the beſt, ſince his giftes were ſo eſtéemed of the moſt.

While he <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1885"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=20">[Page]</a></span> thought of no fellowe in his affection, his paſſions were moderate, but when he knew that <span class="hi">Pomona</span> was his riuall, he loath to brooke a partner in his pleaſure, or a compani­on in his content, reſolued to ſequeſter his delight from hazard of ſurpazing, and thus effected his reſolution. As on a day <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> parched with ſommers heate, and tyrde with faintneſſe, repoſed his weary lims on a gréene banke, <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> not omitting this oppertunitie, gently heaued him from the ground, and ſoftly conueyed him muſing much, into the worlds Weſterne coaſts, wafting this wonder to the fortunate Ilands, the bleſſed ſoyle not annoyde with rough blaſts, nor ouerwhelmd with immo­derate raynes, but ſometimes (though ſeldome) touched with a ſuperficiall moyſture of ſhowres. There he layde him downe in a medowe on a bed of floures, gathered a­gainſt his comming by his ayrie ſeruants, to whome be­fore he had intimated his intent. When the boy was layde, being in a pretie chafe, he ſcolded and exclaymed, though not knowing whome he might accuſe. <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> which felt freſh coales kindled in his heart by this louers combat, ſpake thus. Scolde not my wanton with thy friend, whoſe name if thou deſire, know that it is he which for thy ſake hath oft mantled <span class="hi">Arcadia</span> with <span class="hi">Floras</span> pride to delight thine eies, &amp; comforted thée with a pleaſing coole in extreame heate, to relieue thy faintneſſe, euen <span class="hi">Zephyrus,</span> Lord of the Weſterne blaſts, whome if thou canſt affect, thou ſhalt want nothing which the world can affoorde: try me, truſt me, employ me, impute to me thy deſires, thy delights. This ſayd, reſoluing himſelfe into ayre, he diued into his dearling, on his eyes, on his lips he ſeazd, he ſurfeited: then rayſing him thence, he carried him to his Palace, a moſt pleaſant coole edifice. There <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> re­ſted long, not wanting his will in any wiſh. He was ſer­ued by vnſéene att<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ndants that waited with diligence on their Lords dearling. Varietie of daintieſt fare, choiſe of wines, change of meates, ſtore of delicates, were plenti­fully <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1931"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=21">[Page]</a></span> brought or rather blowne in at appointed houres, tables couered, all things furniſhed with more then princely magnificence, yet no ſeruitour appearing, diuine melodie on windie inſtruments fild his eares with conti­nuall charmes of harmonious ſounds. Oft he walked a­broade to viewe the perfections planted in that ſoyle, and being weary or wanton, roade backe in an ayrie Chariot. But all this could not content him, who wanting his wonted companions, ſeemed to leade a life voyde of com­fort. Hée did therefore ſo importune <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> with chil­diſh complaints, that he vnable to deny him any thing, graunted the boyes moſt earneſt deſire, and ratified his graunt with ſpéedie performance. Truce was taken, and the compoſition ſealed with many kiſſes: the ſumme of their agréement was, that <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> after his arriuall in <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> ſhould ſhunne the ſight of <span class="hi">Pomona,</span> and leaue all other that pretended loue. On theſe conditiōs he was con­ueyd backe, and layd in the place whence he was lifted. The rumor of his returne being bruted abroade, the <span class="hi">Ar­cadians</span> throngd in thicker troupes then before to ſée him, for meaſuring the worth of his preſence by the griefe of his abſence, they could not glut themſelues with gazing on him. So ſoone as <span class="hi">Pomona</span> heard theſe happy tidings, ſhe erecting tropheys in her fancy, vowde to preuent like future miſfortune. Hauing gotten a ſight of him, ſhe ran, he ran, he fled, ſhe followed, and followed ſo faſt, that ſhe ouertooke him in his courſe, and ſtayd him from ſtarting: then ſhe began thus. Shun not thy friend fond wagge which hath ſought thée, ſobd for thée, grieud to looſe thée, glad to finde thée. At firſt I thought that <span class="hi">Iupiter</span> miſliking <span class="hi">Ganimede</span> that now growes ſtale, had taken thée to ſup­ply his roome, or <span class="hi">Venus</span> choſen thée her ſecond <span class="hi">Adonis</span>: But when I heard that <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> had done this, I was the leſſe diſcouraged, knowing my ſelfe able to encoun­ter ſuch an aduerſary, and beard ſo baſ<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> riuall in the pride of his hope. Now I haue got thée, and beſhrow me wan­ton <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1999"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=21">[Page]</a></span> if I watch not your wiles, and kéepe you not in a ſurer garde. This ſayd, ſhe tooke him by the hand, and led the bluſhing boy to her manſion, where ſhe locked him vp cloſe priſoner, reſtraind his former large libertie, allowed him only to walke in her Orchards, and féede on her fruites. O beautie nourſe of bondage, faire ill, ſowre ſwéete. O moſt prepoſterous eſtate of all things, that he ſhould be captiue to them whome his lookes had conque­red. Vngentle Fortune, what malice did ſelly <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> merite, that hauing perfections worth, he ſhould féele pleaſures want? was he therefore faire that he ſhould be infortunate? this by the way, but ile procéede. <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> renewing his olde wont, romde through <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> and miſſing his choiſe, marueiled at the change. Did he vio­late his vowe? tuſh, he was a childe that could not value the vertue of an oath. Was he vrged by others? why not? for he was faire. Did he loue an other? he might, for he was yong. Thus dreading many doubts, he ſwallowed his diſcontent, but when he knewe that <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> was <span class="hi">Po­monaes</span> priſoner, he was ſo enraged with furious paſſi­ons, that he ruminated on nothing ſaue reuenge, and being vnable to hurt ſo power-full a riuall, vowd to inflict vengeance on the whole countrey of <span class="hi">Arcadia.</span> In this im­patient humour, he haſted to the Northren regions, and méeting there with <span class="hi">Boreas,</span> ſaluted him thus. Father of ſtormes, ſalue now the ſorrowes of vnhappy <span class="hi">Zephyrus,</span> thy brother in nature, thy equall in ſubſtance: helpe me, and for euer haue me a friend, a fauourer. I haue in one in­iurie receiued more wrongs then I can reckon. Vnmind­full, vnthankfull <span class="hi">Arcadia</span> not weighing the many fauours by mée affoorded, withholds from me my loue, my life, my hope, my heauen: but if thou powre thy plagues on that vnkinde ſoyle, and oppreſſe the inhabitants with outra­gious furie of thy blaſts, my riuall may repent her raſh­neſſe, and I recouer my loſſe: Do it then deare fellowe, and for this courteſie I will for euer reſt at thy com­maund, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2051"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=22">[Page]</a></span> let thy tryall of affection moue thée to weigh my affliction. <span class="hi">Boreas</span> replide with a rough voyce. Brother <span class="hi">Zephyrus,</span> though our blaſts doe oft effect contrarieties in the ayre, yet are not we contrary in our thoughts. I haue heard thy cauſe, and will auenge thy quarell, ſcourging the continent with ſuch a ſtorme of whirle-windes em­battaild againſt themſelues, rayſing in their tragedies the tropheyes of my mercileſſe fury, that the world hea­ring report of this ruthfull accident, ſhall repute thy cauſe highly reuenged. I vowe to thée by the Scepter of our King, not to defer the execution of thy deſire. <span class="hi">Zephyrus</span> comforted with theſe words, yéelded him many thanks, and returned to the Weſt. <span class="hi">Boreas</span> forthwith iſſude from his icy prouince with a troupe of tempeſts and inuaded <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> where he wrought ſo many miſchieues in a moment, that no eye could viewe them teareleſſe. Groues were diſgarniſhed of their ſhrubs, fields diſfurniſhed of their floures: trées, ſome torne, ſome rent vp by the rootes, cattaile violently carried from the places where they fed, and tumbled headlong downe the cliffes, men ſtagge­ring, could not ſtay their ſteps, leauing therefore their wonted walkes they houſed themſelues. The <span class="hi">Arca­dians</span> grieued with ſo many incommodities, imputed theſe afflictions to the anger of the Gods, whoſe wrath they ſought to appeaſe by Sacrifice. Repairing for coun­ſell to the <span class="hi">Delphi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n</span> Oracle, they receyued this anſwere, that they ſhould ſue to <span class="hi">Aeolus,</span> for he onely could eaſe them, whoſe altars they loaded with many oblations, omitting no vſuall ſolemnities. The God pitying their diſtreſſe, checked <span class="hi">Boreas</span> for his vnruly rage, and limited his boiſtrous furie with appointed boundes, commaun­ding him not to touch the pompe of <span class="hi">Flora,</span> or the hope of <span class="hi">Syluanus,</span> not to wrong the harmeleſſe Huſband-men, or hurt the ſelly Shepheards, but afflict onely the places of <span class="hi">Pomonaes</span> charge, which thing he did. The amorous Goddeſſe ſéeing a generall tranquillitie, and all other <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2108"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=22">[Page]</a></span> places quiet, ſaue where ſhe was preſident, was forced to bridle her affection, and releaſe her priſoner, leaſt for a fickle humor ſhe ſhould looſe her honor. <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> ſet frée, raunged in a childiſh rage, but being weary with wan­dering, he reſted néere a pleaſant Spring, and hauing wept fréely, ſlept ſoundly. In this ſléepe, ſtrange ſléepe, the late ſexe was changed, and of a faire boy a fairer maide faſhioned. Awaking and muſing much at this me­tamorphoſis, ſhe was in the midſt of her dumps raiſde with a ſtrong gale, &amp; carried to a place néere the ſtreights of <span class="hi">Thermopyles,</span> where was a Temple dedicated to <span class="hi">Aeolus,</span> wherein the louely maide was conſecrated a Prieſt to that God, and continued there the whole tearme of her life a ſpotleſſe virgin. Our aunceſtors deſirous to celebrate the remembrance of this rare accident with eternall honor, appointed the day of her change to be for euer, memorizd in a yearely feaſt called <span class="hi">Parthenia,</span> where­in the Prieſt of <span class="hi">Aeolus</span> accompanyed with the faireſt of the youth of both ſexes, offers a noble Sacrifice, diſpoſing all things with due Ceremonies. Which done, they compaſſing the aultar in a ring, ſing a ſolemne Hymne in prayſe of that God. This did our aunceſtors inſtitute, and their progeny hath by long ſucceſſe of time obſerued their deuoute orders. This feaſt muſt be ſolemnized nine dayes hence, whereat doubtleſſe you ſhall ſée this wonder one of that louely <span class="hi">Chorus. Arisbas</span> delighted with this talke, and cheered with hope-full courage, thanked <span class="hi">Damon</span> for his diſcourſe, and reſolued to tarry the néere-appro­ching time, and deſirous in the meane while to rid him­ſelfe of wonted penſiueneſſe, in a veine halfe rude halfe ready, he faſhioned theſe thrée fancies, for taking truce with ſorrowe, yet not wholly ſorrow-leſſe, he felt more comfort, though no full content. But take them as he wrote them, wherein if all be not currant, impute it to his thoughts which were not clearde.

On a faire calme day though a foule ſtorme in mine eſtate, the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ilot miſtaking his courſe, ſtemmed the ſhip on a rock, and <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>he cruel winds continuall furtherers of fortunes ſpight, draue her on with ſuch violence, that ſhe was there ſplit. In this generall ex­tremitie of life, each tooke what was next his hand to ſu­ſtaine him in that hazard: I nimble through feare, got a great péece of the maine Maſt, and thereon committed my ſafetie to the ſeas curteſie, and though euerie ſurge threat­ned ouerwhelming, each waue menaced death, yet I not daunted in theſe dangers kept mine hold. Oft I beheld the Dolphins mounting on the waters vneuen ſuperficies, but at my approach they would ceaſe their ſport, in kind regard of my ruth, not raiſing the billowes with their tumbling, but gently on either ſide following me thus floating, ſée­ming to waft me with wary eyes as carefull of my ſafetie. The day being farre ſpent, I diſcried a ſayle Weſtward, and (ſuch was my hap I know not how to terme it good or ill) it made toward the coaſt on which I was thus toſſed, when I ſaw it ſome what néere, I made ſignes to them a­boord, expreſſing my danger and imploring their aid. They deſirous to ſaue me (for ſometimes miſcreants féele paſſiōs of pitie) ſent two of their fellowes in the long boat to fetch mée, who rowing to mée, tooke mee vp (thus one affection wrought an other) &amp; carried mée aboord with them, where, hoping for ſolace, I found ſorrow. Being in the ſea, though euer dreading to be ſwalowed by the ſurges, yet was I free: In the ſhip though ſa<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e from ſuch perils, yet was I priſo­ner to wretched Pirats from whoſe remorſleſſe hearts all compaſſion was exiled.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3370"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=32">[Page]</a></span>Yet, me they ſought to win by allurements, hoping that I deceiued by their pretended kindneſſe, would ſooner yéeld to their filthie deſires. The ſame night they frolliked with great iollitie for ioy (as they ſaide) of obteining me: when the wine had fired their enflamed luſt, they ſollicited thogh ſucceſſeſſe, their former motions, and ſtroue ſo long for kiſ­ſes but got none, that they left their kindneſſe towards me and fell to contention among themſelues. Their Captaine enuying them, the publike poſſeſſion of his priuat pleaſure though but ſuppoſed, déeming me a praie fitter for himſelfe and iudging a common good not currant, appeaſed the fraie through his authoritie, &amp; did countermaund their paſſions, but priuately he would aſſaile me with all the engines of loue-plotted pollicies, adding cruell threats to kind words, ſometimes entreating, ſometimes menacing, now ſuing, then ſwearing, to obtaine his will, or augment my woe: now praying, then proteſting to enioy me, or enioyne me perpetuall ſlauery. I hearing him in theſe tearmes, fed his humor with vaine hopes, coining new occaſions of delaies, prefixing a time, promiſing, that expired, to yéeld to al kinds of dalliance which he would vſe, limiting my feined profer with <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>his condition, that till then he ſhould ceaſe from pro­ſecuting his intended deſires. He accepting this anſwer for an high fauour, proteſted to obey my doome, and obſerue the propounded conditiō. But ere time winged with thoughts ſwiftneſſe had touched the prefixed point of my then-immi­nent perill, I was happily freed from feare of his force, and deliuered from dread of that danger by <span class="hi">Anaxander,</span> a vali­ant Gentleman of <span class="hi">Sparta,</span> who hauing charge of a Galley ſcoured thoſe ſeas, being ſent by the <span class="hi">Ephori,</span> and bounde by ſtrict commandement to execute ſeuere iuſtice on ſuch ma­lefactors which infeſted the ſeas with piracies, and landing oft on the coaſt of <span class="hi">Laconia,</span> for raged the Country, tooke rich pillage, &amp; committed many ſpoils. But <span class="hi">Anaxander</span> méeting this neaſt of théeues, part of that accurſed ſocietie, encoun­tred them, and hauing after ſmall fight bourded them, put <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3408"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=32">[Page]</a></span> all that crue of caitiues to the ſword, accounting mercy to ſuch offenders an high blemiſh of iuſtice. Me onely he ſa­ued, &amp; with gentlemanlike compaſſion pittied my diſtreſſe. You may perhaps ſuppoſe that now my ſorrowes were en­ded, and I in protection of this worthie patron, without the compaſſe of fortunes reach: but if you ſo thinke, your iudge­ments faile: theſe my ſea-fortunes &amp; thoſe vnſtaied waues, do in moſt liuely ſort expreſſe the vncertaintie of worldes wauering, as by attending the ſequele, you may eaſily con­ceipt.</p><p>When the report of this exploit was bruted to the eares of thoſe other monſters, (for the minde of man degenerating from the decorum of humanitie becomes monſtrous, com­plotting miſchiefes excéeding the vildeneſſe of beaſtes, and the bodie the mindes inſtrument, ſlaue to that tyrannicall gouernment, wherein affections rule and reaſon obeyes, effects them) they I ſay hearing this, lamented the ill hap of their fellowes, eſpecially the Captaines death, whome they affected for his valure, and admired for his villanies, to them ſéeming vertues. But cōuerting their mones into mad fury, they confederated themſelues in a bloudy league, vowing extreame reuenge on that worthie Gentleman whome they opprobriouſly tearmed the proud Iuſticier of <span class="hi">Lacedaemon.</span> They had got togither ſixe veſſels, &amp; Reſicles a <span class="hi">Cretan</span> was Admirall of this accurſed fléete: fortune ſil­dome foe to worſt attemptes, ſuted their expectation with hoped ſucceſſe. For méeting the <span class="hi">Spartan</span> Galley, they en­compaſſed her, and commencing a bloudie broile, after long fight laid vs aboord, ſlue them all, and not ſatiſfied with this butchery, exerciſed more barbarous crueltie, mangling the dead bodies into many péeces. Here againe I eſcaped death reſerued by fortune, for a ſecond brunt of diſhonour which likewiſe I preuented, not touched with the leaſt ſpot of re­proach. The ſouldiers of <span class="hi">Reſicles</span> taking me, brought me to their Captaine, who fancying in his fond thoughts a world of future imagined pleaſures, entertained me kindly, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3445"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=33">[Page]</a></span> wooed me with many curteſies, I filled him with vaine hopes, limiting my conſent with delaie of time as I vſed the other before, and meane while plotted meanes for my eſcape, which thus I effected. At the very time wherin the feaſt of <span class="hi">Theſmophoria</span> was celebrated at <span class="hi">Eleuſis</span> with my­ſticall obſeruations by the Prieſts of <span class="hi">Ceres, Reſicles</span> hauing left his fellow-Pyrats which diſperſed themſelues to pur­chaſe booties, tooke a veſſell of <span class="hi">Samos</span> returning from <span class="hi">Syria,</span> a rich prize. The day enſuing, he &amp; his accurſed companions applied themſelues wholly to myrth and belly-chéere for ioy of their good fortune, ſeeming to celebrate the <span class="hi">Baccha­nals</span> in their diſordred dyet, dyet I terme it, becauſe they oft vſed ſuch exceſſe. When the wine had preuailed, and fumes aſcending from their ſtomaches had beſieged their ouer­whelmed braines, ſummoning their diſtempered ſenſes to reſt, they laie as drowned in a ſléepie charme, without feare or regard, in euery corner ſome. The winde and ſea the one quiet, the other calme, did fauour them: fortune their com­mon friend did not annoy them with approach of enemies: for if a tempeſt had bene raiſed, or the foe aſſailed them, doubtleſſe they had receiued a full reward of their diſſolute demeanours. I iudging this a fit time for my eſcape, ſlily conueied my ſelfe into the long boat, and cutting the roape rowed ſo well as I could, to the ſhore which was not farre off: leaping on land, I left my boat to the ſeas direction, and running with haſted ſteppes diſcryed two <span class="hi">Arcadians,</span> both which are now preſent, the one a friendly relieuer of my di­ſtreſſe. I entreated their tariance by ſigns, and being come to them, was kindly comforted by them. Since which time I haue remained in this Country, where what fortunes I haue felt, moſt <span class="hi">Arcadians</span> can relate.</p><p>Thus haue I contriued the rehearſall of my troubles into a briefe diſcourſe. <span class="hi">Timoclea</span> would faine haue procée­ded, but a generall murmure of admiration raiſed by the whole aſſembly hindred her entended purpoſe. <span class="hi">Aegon</span> ſtood vp, &amp; ſuing for ſilence by ſignes, hauing obtained audience <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3495"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=33">[Page]</a></span> ſpake thus. Country-men and friends, doubtleſſe the diſco­uery of this rare ſecret and due guerdon of loues long-ſuf­fering patience, was deferred to this time by iuſt preſci­ence of the immortall powers. For next the rare hap of <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> whoſe memory we now celebrate, what other acci­dent could ſo directly fit the feaſt of <span class="hi">Parthenia?</span> As his ſexe was miraculouſly changed from a faire ladde to the faireſt girle that euer liued in <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> ſo this lampe of royaltie, the Paragon of womans perfections, found in this place at this time, the onely occaſion of diſcloſing of her diſguiſe, and being ſuppoſed by all the mirror of our ſexe, may now be tearmed the wonder of woman-kinde. The whole aſſem­bly applauded his words, arguing hereby, that they confir­med his opinion by their cōſenting cenſures. Many floures were throwne on thoſe two louers, the floures of true af­fection, and each departing, filled his natiue prouince with report of this rare accident: ſo that the miraculous meta­morphoſis of <span class="hi">Hyalus</span> was almoſt drowned in obliuion.</p><p><span class="hi">Arisbas</span> hauing repoſſeſſed his Loue the ſtaie of his life, thinking it high time to glad his aged father with his re­turne, whoſe diſcontent (as he not vainly ſuppoſed) his de­parture had bred, taking with him his deareſt <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> with <span class="hi">Damon</span> and <span class="hi">Aegon,</span> tarrying litle in <span class="hi">Arcadia,</span> haſted to the next hauen, and there embarqued for <span class="hi">Cyprus,</span> where arriuing in the hauen of <span class="hi">Famagoſta,</span> he found a wonderfull change. For the aged King diſpairing of his eldeſt ſonnes ſafetie, had matched <span class="hi">Anaxilas</span> the ſecond brother of <span class="hi">Arisbas,</span> with the <span class="hi">Lemnian</span> Princes daughter, whoſe father decea­ſing immediatly after the marriage, he in right of his wife reigned Prince of <span class="hi">Lemnos. Arisbas</span> nothing diſcontent with theſe newes, ſent one to certifie his father of his ar­riuall. The old King repleniſhed with incredible ioy, was tranſported into a trance: recouering himſelf, he haſted his aged ſteps towardes the hauen and méeting his ſonne by the way, fel on his necke ſhedding many teares, ſwéete ar­guments of his high content. <span class="hi">Arisbas</span> preparing to craue <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3581"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=34">[Page]</a></span> pardon of his departure, was preuented by his oft redou­bled fatherly welcomes and embraces: with like kindneſſe he entertained trembling and bluſhing <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> &amp; ſpake curteouſly to <span class="hi">Damon</span> and <span class="hi">Aegon.</span> Returning to the palace he tooke great delight in hearing his ſonne relate the trou­bles and daungers with oft changes of Fortune endured by him and his deareſt <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> and iudging it inex­piable impietie to hinder the ſucceſſe of ſo rare affection reſolued to giue loue his right and marrie them honou­rably. For this purpoſe hee ſent Herauldes to all the Ilandes adiacent, and Prouinces ſcituate in the maine of <span class="hi">Greece,</span> which publiſhed in his name leaue and libertie of acceſſe to all whom ſoeuer, eſpecially ſtrangers of account which would repaire to his Court, and be preſent at the nuptiall of his ſon, &amp; honour him in ſuch princelike exerci­ſes as might beſt beſéeme the worth of that intended ſo­lemnitie, not omitting to expreſſe the time. Theſe meſſa­ges had ſuch ſucceſſe, that beſides a troupe of meaner per­ſons, the moſt worthie <span class="hi">Heroes</span> of <span class="hi">Greece</span> appeared at the appointed time, &amp; being preſent at the ceremonies of <span class="hi">Hy­mens</span> rytes, gaue honourable teſtimonie of their perfour­mance. The <span class="hi">Cyprian</span> Kings ſecond ſonne then ſoueraigne of <span class="hi">Lemnos,</span> and his faire Princeſſe, were part of that royall aſſembly, whereat the Nobles of <span class="hi">Cyprus</span> did gliſter in al­moſt-kingly pompe. Forthwith many honourable ſportes and déeds of chiualry were exerciſed, in which <span class="hi">Arisbas</span> and <span class="hi">Anaxilas</span> were chiefe challengers, ſuted both in pureſt white, mounted both on milke-white Courſers, richly ca­parraſoned. The old King entending farther fauour to his ſonne, and deſirous to diſburthen himſelfe of the heauie charge of gouernment, and inueſt his age with eaſe, ſur­rendred his eſtate, &amp; reſigned y<sup>e</sup> regiment to <span class="hi">Arisbas,</span> whom he cauſed to be adorned with the royall Diademe, and he entending like fauour to his deareſt <span class="hi">Timoclea,</span> cauſed her to be likewiſe crowned Queene of <span class="hi">Cyprus.</span></p><p>Theſe ſecond ſolemnities thus finiſhed, the princelyke <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3666"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5639&amp;page=34">[Page]</a></span> ſtrangers and others departed, bruting an honourable re­port of the <span class="hi">Cyprian</span> Courts royaltie. <span class="hi">Damon</span> and <span class="hi">Aegon</span> hauing receiued rare entertainment and rich rewards for their former courteſies, ſhipped themſelues for <span class="hi">Arcadia.</span> Fortune ending frownes with fauours, did thus abſolue the cataſtrophe of this roial Comedy, which was yet imper­fect. The old Cing of <span class="hi">Epirus</span> deceaſing, his ſonne <span class="hi">Soſtratus</span> a man of milder diſpoſition, ſuccéeded him in the Crowne, who remembring the former good ſeruice of baniſhed <span class="hi">Ari­ſtophon,</span> and knowing his innocencie, ſent immediatly af­ter his coronation, an honourable Ambaſſage to conclude a league with the yoong King of <span class="hi">Cyprus,</span> and reduce thence guiltleſſe <span class="hi">Ariſtophon</span> from exile. The Ambaſſadour was royally receiued and entertained in the Court of <span class="hi">Cyprus,</span> and hauing declared the cauſe of his comming, ſped in both his demands. For the league of amitie betwéene thoſe two mightie Princes was ſolemnely concluded by oath, and <span class="hi">Ariſtophon</span> deſirous to laie his bones in the mother-ſoyle that brought him forth, was ſoone perſuaded to return. Ta­king his leaue therfore of y<sup>e</sup> old prince, the yong King &amp; his daughter raiſed to ſuch royall eſtate, he returned into his Country, hauing with him the other Péere of <span class="hi">Epyrus,</span> and a noble man of <span class="hi">Cyprus</span> ſent by <span class="hi">Arisbas,</span> to cauſe King <span class="hi">So­ſtratus</span> to ſweare likewiſe, that the league might be confir­med by their mutuall othes. Such was the ſucceſſe of this rare oft-thwarted loue which my ouerbold penne hath pre­ſumed thus rudely to diſcyper, If any <span class="hi">decorum</span> be omitted, or <span class="hi">indecorum</span> committed, I can not otherwiſe excuſe it (curteous Gentlemen) then by your fauours which wil (I hope) beare with ſuch imperfections, &amp; not impute it to mine owne deſert, which was loth to polliſh a toy, whereon I neuer beſtowed more la­bour, then ſometimes an idle houre of recreation.</p><div class="trailer">FINIS.</div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Dickenson, John, romance writer..
