Of the Scithians (whose whole substance and riches of a man being a yoake of Oxen and a plow, a Nagge and his dogge, his bowe and his quiuer) were inuincible a­gainst Darius and other Monarckes.

But here yet by the way <span class="hi">(Right honourable and worshipfull)</span> as I applaude in this their well doing, so it had beene a thing of Brit­taine most worthelie to be wished, for that Prince him selfe lesse opprobrius of all mē more praise worthie, and most pretiouse in the sight of God: if the serpent Ty­rus had wanted here his vennime vncurable, though his flesh proued medicinable against all other poysons (as saith Cardanus in his booke of Comfort.) I meane if Vther Pendragon had wanted that serpentine poyson of adulterie, Nigromancie &amp; murther (things odible to God and good men:) when that most incomperable King Arthure of great Brittaine for his princely pro­wesse, valiant vertues, and triumphant victories yet prooued more Royally renoumed throughoute all the worlde in his time and to his posteritie. The He­brwes with greate and not vndeserued titles extolled their Iudas Maccabeus. Homer the glory of all Greeke Poets left Hector and Achilles most commendable vn­to the worlde. Neyther by lesse diligence did the Gre­cians adorne with praise Alexander the most mightie conquerour. And the Romanes aduanced the noble actes of their Caesar to the Skyes not enough. The Bur­gonians profoundly praised Godfrey of Bulloyn (for his noble valiancy) as the scourge of the Sarazens in his dayes. And as euery one of those are commended with due desert: so in like māner there were neuer Brittaines wanting of excellent learning and exquisite knowledge to leaue with carefull diligence and credible commen­dation, the progenie, life, prowesse prosperitie, and tri­umphant victories of our said auncient Arthure wor­thely published vnto the worlde.

And very many others there were borne in adultery, (as by the Auncient History largely appeareth) whose prowesse at home, and in warres, notably excelled. Amongest whome also our <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> the chiefest ornament of <span class="hi">Brittayne,</span> and the onely myracle of his time, florished famously.

Certes Reader, I pray God I be deade but thou woul­dest desire to see the same, such and so greate is both the anti­quitie and also the maiesty of the thing. At length the keeper of those secretes was there requested by me to signifie vnto me, if he had learned any thing ouer and besides this, as touching the seale hanging thereat.

Certes (except my coniecture faileth me) the expences or charge is small in deede, yea, none at all. This yet in the meane time pleaseth me, that while we in­treate of <span class="hi">Arthure</span> and of things done by him, <span class="hi">Glastenbury</span> is alwaies at hand and most friendly promiseth his endeuour towardes assured knowledge of things.

But by the way, least I should seeme not mindefull enough of my promise, I come againe to the encounter ready to vanquish the force of argumentes which the aduersaries haue gotten. The <span class="hi">Ro­mane</span> writers (say they) made no mention of <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> wherefore, like it is to be true, that he was not liuing.</p><p>If no thing be true, but that which appeareth by truth of <span class="hi">Romane</span> writers, it should go euill to passe with the history of the whole worlde. The infinite force of thinges worthie of memory, and of noble effect consisteth rather of eye witnesses at home resident and inhabiting, then of the vncertaine rela­tion made by forraine writers.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note278">Romanes carefull for their owne fame, but neg­ligent in all o­ther mens.</span> For the <span class="hi">Romanes</span> made al­most all the whole worlde bond slaues: and writers which proceeded amongest them, and were there borne applyinge their mindes to the study of eloquence, made their owne ex­ploytes euen admirable or wonderfull: but the enterprises &amp; actes of other Nations they dyed euen so obscure and debase, that almost they made them none at all.</p><p>For the matter was so handled by them, that they woulde elegantly and not truly pleade their cause. They painted out such thinges in writinges, which they might rather law­fully hope for, then see at that time, done by the most prudent Gouernours. And vndoubtedly maruell it is not, that they made no remembrance at all of <span class="hi">Arthure.</span> The <span class="hi">Goathes</span> at that time had inuaded <span class="hi">Italy,</span> and barbarouse style with phrase of writing and speaking was brought in, in steade of elo­quence,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note279">Honour vnto learning in times past rare.</span> so farre forth, that honour vnto learning was rare, &amp; rewardes for the same, were most rarely vnder stoode off.

If he meane touching that History which is reade amongest the common sorte in the <span class="hi">Italian, Spanish, Frenche</span> and <span class="hi">English</span> tongues, I do not much striue with him. Although the vpright reader shall call to minde, the same thing hath beene often times done, euen in the History each where forraine of <span class="hi">Charles, Rowlande, Godfrey, Guy,</span> and <span class="hi">Bellouse,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note280">Most puysant Personages haue beene parcyally pray­sed in truth.</span> that I may let passe many others. Neyther yet not­withstanding are their names, or credit of the true History taken away the more. It is no noueltie, that men mixe tri­flinge toyes with true thinges, and surely this is euen done with a certaine employment that writers might captiuate y<sup>•</sup> simple common people with a certaine admiration at them when they heare of marueylouse matters. So was <span class="hi">Hercu­les,</span> so was <span class="hi">Alexander,</span> so <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> and so was also <span class="hi">Charles</span> commended. But there is an other farre greater reason in­cident to the History of <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> then I do conceaue of. For those thinges which are not apparant in course of ages, which are not probable, which as aliable helpes agree not with the credit of Authours, which are not embraced in long exercise of y<sup>•</sup> ages, and furderance of learned men, &amp; by them compro­bate or fully ratified I do not vnaduisedly allow off.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note281">Graius the Authour of that booke Schalecronic<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> had much a doe with suc<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> backbiters</span> Many yeares againe, <span class="hi">Graius</span> the Authour of the booke <span class="hi">Schalecro­nicon</span> (as I suppose) had great contention with this rable of backbyters.

That is most true, wher­as <span class="hi">Beda</span> other wise a good man and a learned, did not onely sienderly esteeme of the glory of <span class="hi">Brittaines</span> name, but also despysed or neglected it.

Whereupon to him that should then take in hand to write of Antiquitie touching <span class="hi">Brittaine,</span> all thinges were most obscure and vnknowne. There are which thinke many thinges haue beene translated into <span class="hi">Ar­morica</span> or the lesser <span class="hi">Brittaine,</span> although at this day verie fewe thinges may be hoped for from thence, sauing that a few notes are extant in most auncient exemplars of the liues of holie men thither reparing, and which intermixe light with darknesse.</p><p><span class="hi">Gulielmus Paruus</span> of <span class="hi">Bridelington,</span> in his Prologue before his History thus thundereth out his errour.</p><p><span class="hi">Gal<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ridus Hic dictus est,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note284">William Par­ <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>us <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>un­der of Arthure</span> <span class="hi">cognomen habens <span class="hi">Arthurij,</span> qui diuinationum illarum nenias ex Britannica lingua transtulit, quibus vt non frustra creditur, ex proprio fig­mento multa adiecit. William Paruus</span> there saith: This man is called <span class="hi">Geoffry</span> bearing the sirname of <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> who translated y<sup>e</sup> Fabulus Dreames of those prophecies <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ut of y<sup>•</sup> <span class="hi">Brittaine</span> language: whereunto he (as men do not credit <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12203"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=8884&amp;page=43">[Page 37]</a></span> vainelie hath also added many thinges after the deuice and imagination of his owne braine. These wordes vttereth he vpon a stomake and contempte. But I will sing him a contrarie songe euen for euer and a day. That men beleeue him in vaine, except he prooue this rather by reason, then by naked or playne wordes.</p><p>Well I knowe, and that too well, manie fables and vani­ties are disperced throughout the whole history of <span class="hi">Brittaine.</span> Yet, therein are matters (if a man behold the same more thorowly) such as might not be desired without greate hinde­rance of auncient knowledge, and which beeing rather reade then vnderstood by <span class="hi">William Paruus</span> beare not any shewe at all of commodity. Againe, I will also heere set downe an­other honourable testimony, namely not onely touching the Interpreter of the historie, but also concerning <span class="hi">Arthure</span> him selfe. Plainly it appeareth, that whatsoeuer thinges this fel­low published in writing (concerning <span class="hi">Arthure,</span> and <span class="hi">Merline</span> to feede y<sup>e</sup> curiositie of the not so discreete persōs) were fained­ly inuented of lying and dissembling Authours. Let him cogge and foyste sixehundreth times, if hee will. <span class="hi">Merli­nus</span> was in very deede a man euen miraculously learned in knowledge of thinges naturall, and especially in the science Mathematicall: For the which cause he was most acceptable and that deseruingly vnto the <span class="hi">Princes</span> of his time, and a farre other manner of man, then that hee woulde re­pute himselfe as one subiect vnto y<sup>•</sup> iudgement of any cowled or loytering grosseheaded Moncke. But I will let passe <span class="hi">Arthure</span> and <span class="hi">Merline,</span> the one more valiant, the other more learned, then that they ought to regarde eyther the pratling or importunitie of the common people. And that seemeth vnto me a thing most vnequall and against all right,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note285">Monacus Mo­naco I<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>uidet.</span> that one Moncke beareth enuie towardes another Moncke, which is euen dead and gone. <span class="hi">William Par­uus</span> might haue hoped for greater victory of the liuing, then of the deade Persons.

Neither is there cause why hee should hope for the present helpe of that Phisition <span class="hi">Polidorus</span> from the Citie <span class="hi">Vrbinas,</span> for as much as hee him selfe also languishing of like disease hath very greate neede of a cunning mans cure.

For I knowe very well, <span class="hi">How slender Furniture I haue at home:</span> For the which cause I challenge not any thing at all vnto my selfe: Vndoubtedly I might soone appeare both rash &amp; vnwise, if I should so doe. Onely I purposed of good wil to make tryall of my wit in a matter honest, to helpe the history languishing, to aduance the glory of my country, hindred by enuy, and beeing enthralled vnto the crafty deceiptes of euill willers, restore the same honestly vnto liberty. I knowe it will come to passe, that most mighty enemies will assaulte my doinges: Let them ouer­come with powre, if they can, so the trueth be ours. I will imitate the Noble <span class="hi">Palme Tree,</span> which beeing pressed downe with heauie burdens yet falleth not to the ground at any time.
