The bookes that were not long ago set forth, concerning Conie­catching and crosse-biting, and the discouerie of each (if anie sparke of grace were) might haue beene so manie restraints <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e243"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19091&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> and bridles to call them from that abominable life, but they that are giuen ouer to their owne hearts lust, with all their might inueigh both against them and their Authour.</p><p>I haue therefore, Gentlemen, as one inforced (<span class="hi">amore patriae</span>) taken in hand to publish this little Pamphlet (which by a very friend came by a chance to my hands, and adding somewhat of mine owne knowledge, and vpon verie credible informa­tion) most necessarie in my mind for the good of the com­mon wealth, both for all men to see, what grosse villanies are now practised in the bright Sunne-shine, that thereby they may be forewarned to take heede how they conuerse with such cosoning companions: as also a iust checke and controll to such wicked liuers, that they perceiuing their goodnesse set abroch, may with remorse and penitencie forsake their abo­minable course of life, and betake them to a more honest and ciuill behauiour. If any with the spider heere seeke to sucke poison, let such a one take heede, that in practising his villany he chaunce commence Bachelor in Whittington Colledge, and so in good time take his degrees and proceede Doctor, and thence with a solemne procession take possession of do­ctor <span class="hi">Stories</span> cappe; to which some of the worshipfull compa­nie of Conicatchers haue worthily heretofore attained.</p><p>In this Treatise (louing countrimen) you shall see what shifts this crue of helhounds haue put in practise since the bookes of Conicatching came forth vnder these names. viz. <span class="hi">The Art of Humoring. The Art of carrying stones; W. St Lift. Ia. lame. Ned Br. catch,</span> and <span class="hi">Blacke Robins kindnesse:</span> Wher­in are manifested the nature of Humorists, such as can insinu­ate themselues into euerie mans companie: &amp; as they see him addicted, so will they verse vpon him, what policies they haue to purloine goods out of shops vnder the pretence of plain­nesse, what shifts they haue to cosen poore Alewiues, by the art of carrying stones, what inconuenience may come by fol­lowing slattering strumpets, I know not I what should be the cause why so innumerable harlots and Curtizans abide about London, but because that good lawes are not looked vnto: is there not one appointed for the apprehending of such hell­moths, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e283"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19091&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> that eat a man out of bodie &amp; soule? And yet there be more notorious strumpets &amp; their mates about the Citie and the suburbs, then euer were before the Marshall was appoin­ted: idle mates I meane, that vnder the habit of a Gentleman or seruing man, think themselues free from the whip, although they can giue no honest account of their life. I could wish, and so it is to be wished of euery honest subiect, that <span class="hi">Amasis</span> lawe were receiued, who ordained that euerie man at the yeares end should giue an account to the Magistrate how hee liued, and he that did not so, or could not make an account of an honest life to be put to death as a fellon, without fauor or par­don: What then should become of a number of our vpstart gallants, that liue only by the sweate of other mens browes, and are the decay of the sorwardest Gentlemen and best wits? Then should we haue fewer conicatching strumpets, who are the verie causes of all the plagues that happen to this flouri­shing common wealth. They are the destruction of so manie Gentlemen in England. By them many Lordships come to ruine. What dangers growe by dallying with such vnchast Li­bertines, and what inconuenience followes by their inordinat Pleasures, let those that haue had wofull experience and mai­ster Surgeon together testifie: nay, they not onely indanger the bodie by lothsom diseases, but ingraue a perpetuall shame in the forehead of the partie, and finally consume his soule and make him fit for the diuell.</p><p>To leaue these base companions (that can by no wholsom counsell, nor aduised perswasions bee disswaded from their lothsom kind of lise, nor called to any honest course of liuing) in the dregges of their dishonesty. Would it please the hono­rable and worshipfull of the land to take order for the cutting off of these cosoners, and consuming cankers of this common wealth, they should not only cause a blessing to be powred on this flourishing state, but haue the prayers of euery good sub­iect for their prosperous health: and welfare. And thus Gen­tlemen, I conclude with this farewell: God either conuert or confound such base companions.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Yours to vse, <span class="hi">S.

Neuerthe­lesse with the Authors leaue, I will ouerlooke some lawe tearmes ex­pressed in the first part of Conicatching: whereunto, as the Author saith, is necessarilie required thrée parties: <span class="hi">The set­ter, the Verser, and the Barnacle.</span> Indéed I haue heard some retainers to this ancient trade dispute of his procéedings in this case, and by them in a full Synode of quart pots it was thorowlie examined and concluded, that there were no such names, as he hath set downe, nor anie cheating Arte so christened as Conicatching. Marie, in effect there is the like vnderhand traffique daylie vsed and experien­ced among some fewe start vp Gallants disperst about the suburbs of London, who tearmes him that drawes the fish to the bait, the <span class="hi">Beater,</span> and not the <span class="hi">Setter:</span> the Tauerne where they go, the Bush, and the foole so caught, the Bird.

Extortion had béene a large theame to haue wrought vpon: and with the Usurers bagges full of gold he might haue handled another pretie Treatise: He might haue brought forth Justice weying bread, and the Baker putting his eares in the ballance to make euen weight. He should haue personated the Thames most piti­fully complaining, what monstrous hauocke the Brew­ers make of her water, without all remorse or compassi­on: and how they put in willowe leaues and broome buds into their woort in steed of hoppes. So likewise a Christian exhortation to mother Bunch would not haue done amisse, that she should not mixe lime with her Ale, to make it mightie, or cozen the Quéenes liege people of their drink, by fubbing them off with these <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ender wasted blacke pots and Cannes, that will hold little more then a <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ring.

Haue you not a well (quoth hee) on the backe side of your house that stands thus, and thus, for mine owne part I was neuer there (that I can tell of) to see. Yes that I haue, sayd the Hoste. Well (said Maister Do­ctor) in the bottome of that well is your cuppe: where­fore goe search presently, and you shall finde my words true. The goodman with all expedition did as hee willed him, and drew the well dr<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e: at last hee spied his Goblet where it lay. It was no néede to bid him take it vp, for in his owne person hee went downe in the bucket: and full lightly to Maister Doctour <span class="hi">Pinch­packes</span> chamber bee trudged, and caried him fortie shil­lings, offering him besides a mone<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>hs boord in requit all of his great curteste.

Wherefore he perswaded his wife to disclose her selfe to him, and to dispence with a little inconuenience, so they may be resolued of so rare a secret. But this was Doctor <span class="hi">Pinchbackes</span> drift, hee thought to haue shifted the Gentleman off by this extraordinarie imposition, thinking he would rather haue surceased his sute, then anie waie haue suffered him to sée his wife naked. In conclusion a chamber was prepared warme and close, in which she shewed her selfe, &amp; twise walked vp and down the chamber naked in the presence of M. Doctor and her husband, who demanded M. Doctors answer to his for­mer question, which was as followeth: Quoth he, from meward it is a boy, and to me ward it is a girle: other answer they could get none of him. Wherefore the Gen­tleman was greatly offended against him, calling him Asse, Dolt, Patch, Cockescombe, Knaue, and all the base names he could deuise. But awaie went maister Doctor as skilfull in those cases as a blind man when he throweth his staffe: and durst not answer the Gentle­man one word. And the Gentleman greatly repen­ted him that he had been so foolish to shew his wife in that sort before so sottish a companion.</p><p>About foure dayes after the Gentlewoman fell in la­bour, and was deliuered of a boy and a girle: where­at the Gentleman remembring the blunt answer of the Doctor, and finding it to be true, was greatly asto­nished, supposing indéed hee had mightily wronged the Doctor: to whom he went immediately crauing par­don for his former follie, shewing himselfe verie sorow­full for his fault, and offered him in recompence of a­mends all the fauour he might possibly doe him, gran­ting to him his house at commandement, and his boord for so long time as he would continue with him. Wher­upon in signe of loue and amitie he went and soiour­ned at the Gentlemans house: Whereupon the Doctors <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3275"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19091&amp;page=25">[Page]</a></span> credit still more and more began to increase, so that all the countrie round about told no small tales of the great running of Doctor <span class="hi">Pinchbacke,</span> to whom they resorted early ano late.</p><p>It fortuned soone after shere was a Faire neere to the Gentlemans house, where the people diuersly tal­ked of the Doctors skill and cunni<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>, and that he could doe anie thing, or tell anie thing that was done in anie place. Naie (quosh a plaine Countriman) I will ven­ture twentie Nobles that hee shall not doe it. I will my selfe goe personally to him, and hold something in my hand, and if hee tell me what it is I will lose my money. I take you, sayd one or two, and the wager be­ing layd, awaie they went towards the Gentlemans house: and passing thorough a meadow, the man tooke vp a Grashopper out of the grasse, and put it into his hand, so close that no man might perceiue it. Then for­ward they went, and met with Maister Doctor, and they desired him to satis<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e them of that secret which was vpon his credit<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>, to tell them what one of the com­panie held in his hand. Whereunto the Doctor was loth to answer, considering he had no such skill as peo­ple bruted abroade: neuer the lesse he cast in his mind, how he might excuse the matter by some pretie sleight, if he should guesse amisse, and therfore concluded in this <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>st, he called to mind that his owne name was <span class="hi">Gra­shopper,</span> and if (quoth he) I take him by the hand, I may say hee hath a grashopper in his hand, and yet I may <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ustly defend it for a truth. Whereupon the Doctor ta­king him by she hand, said he had a Grashopper in his hand: which béeing opened was found true. Whereat the Cuntrimen wondred, and went their wayes. Some said hee was but a cosoning knaue: others reported what wonders hee could perfor<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>: Some said he could <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3327"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19091&amp;page=26">[Page]</a></span> g<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e round about the world in a moment, and that h<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> walked euerie night in the aire with spirites: some said hee had a familiar: thus the people gaue their cen­ <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ure; some liking, and others mi<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>king him.

The Doctour a while coylié refused the Ge<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> tlemans offer, but béeing earnestly entreated of the Gentleman, he answered him to this effect.</p><p>Sir, for your great friendship hitherto and vnex­pected kindnesse, at this time I cannot but confess<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> my selfe much indebted to you: and because you are so importunate with me to marie your daughter (al­though I protest it is not for my profite) I doe willing­ly take her to my wife: for I haue (saith hée) refuse<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> many faire and personable Gentlewomen in mine owne countrey with large dowrtes: but to make you part of amends for your <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, I here am content to yeeld to your request.

The Gentleman was verie vnwilling to leaue the D­ctors companie; but séeing the Doctor so importu­nate, at last yéelded, and so lent the Doctor and his boy two of his best geldings: who as soone as they were on horsebacke, neuer minding to returne againe, tooke their iourney into Deuonshire, and there so long as his foure hundred pounds lasted made merie with their companions, till at last hauing spent all, beganne to renue his olde trade, and after being taken in compa­nie with some suspected persons was apprehended, and by the law (as I heard) was condemned to bee hanged for a murtherer.</p><p>Thus although pexaduenture hee was not guiltie of the murther, yet it was a <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ust punishment for his villanie before practised.</p><p>The Gentleman after a quarter of a yeare was past, beganne to looke for the Doctors comming home againe, but in vaine; so hee passed a twelue moneth, ex­pecting his sonne in lawes returne: at last as happe was one of the Gentlemans acquaintance hauing beene at his house, and séeing the Doctor there, brought word home to the Gentleman that hee sawe the Do­ctor <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3462"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19091&amp;page=27">[Page]</a></span> for certaine executed at Exceter in <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, for a muder.
