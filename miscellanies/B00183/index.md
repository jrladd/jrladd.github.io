_[figure]_

GOld tane from the Kings Harbengers,

downe a downe a downe,

as ſeldome hath beene ſeene,

downe a downe a downe,

And carried by bold Robin Hood,

for a preeſent to the Queene.

downe a downe a downe.

If that I liue a yeare to an end,

thus can Quéene Katherine ſay:

Bold Robin Hood, I will be thy friend,

and all thy Yeomen gay.

The Quéene is to her Chamber gone,

as faſt as ſhee can wen,

She cals vnto her lonely Page,

his name was Richard Patringten.

Come hither to me thou louely Page,

come thou hither to mee.

For thou muſt poſt to Nottingham

as faſt as thou can drée.

And as thou goeſt to Nottingham,

ſearch all thoſe Engliſh wood,

Enquire of one good Yeoman or another,

that can tell thee of Robin Hood.

Sometimes hee went, ſometimes hée ran,

as faſt as hee could win,

And when hee came at Nottingham,

there he tooke vp his Inne.

And when he came at Nottingham,

and had tooke vp his Inne,

He cals for a Pottle of Reniſh wine,

and dranke a health to his Quéene.

There ſate a Yeoman by his ſide,

tell me ſweet Page ſaid hee,

What is thy buſineſſe, or the cauſe

ſo far in this North Countrey.

This is my buſineſſe and the cauſe,

Sir, Ile tell it you for good,

To enquire of one good yeoman or another

to tell me of Robin Hood.

Ile get my horſe betime in the morne,

be it be breake of day,

And I will ſhew thee bold Robin Hood,

and all his Yeomen gay.

When that he came at Robin Hoods place,

he fell downe on his knée,

Queene Katherine ſhe doth greet you well,

ſhe gréets you well by me.

She bids you poſt to faire London Court,

not fearing any thing,

For there ſhall be a little ſport,

and ſhe hath ſent you her Ring.

Robin tooke his mantle from his backe,

it was of the Lincolne gréene,

And ſent that by this louely Page,

for a preſent vnto the Queene.

In Summer time when leaues grow gréene,

it's a ſeemely ſight to ſée

How Robin Hood himſelfe had dreſt,

and all his Yeomandry.

He clothed his men in Lincolne gréene,

and himſelfe in Scarlet Red,

Blacke hats, white feathers, all alike

now bold Robin Hood is rid.

And when he came at Londons Court,

hee fell downe on his knée,

Thou art welcome Lockſly, ſaid the Quéen,

and all thy good Yeomen three.

The King is into Fensbury field

marching in battle ray,

And after fellowes bold Robin Hood,

and all his Yeomen gay.

Come hither Tepus (ſaid the King)

downe a downe a downe,

how bearer after me,

downe a downe a downe,

Come meaſure mout with this line,

how long our marke ſhall be.

downe a downe a downe.

### 1.1. To ſecond part,

To the ſame tune.

VVHat is the wager ſaid the Quéene,

that muſt I now know here?

Thrée hundred Tun of Rheniſh wine,

three hundred Tun of Béere.

Thrée hundred of the fatteſt Harts

that ran on Dallom Lee.

That's a Princely wager ſaid the King,

that needs muſt I tell thee.

With that beſpake one Clifton then,

downe a downe a downe,

fall quickly and full ſoone,

downe a downe a downe,

Meaſure no markes for vs moſt Soueraigne ſiege,

wée'l ſhoot at Sun and Moone.

downe a downe a downe.

Full fifteene ſcore your marke ſhall be,

full fifteene ſcore ſhall ſtand:

Ile lay my bow ſaid Clifton then,

Ile cleaue the Willow wand.

With that the Kings Archer led about,

while it was three and none:

With that the Ladies began to ſhout,

Madam your game is gone.

A boone, a boone, Queene Katherine cries,

I craue on my bare knée:

Is there any knight of your priuy counſell,

of Queene Katherines part will be?

Come hither to mée Sir Richard Lee,

thou art a knight full good,

For I doe know by thy pedigrée,

thou ſprung'ſt from Gowers blood.

Come hither to me thou Biſhop of Hereford­ſhire,

for a noble Prieſt was hee,

By my ſiluer Miter ſaid the Biſhop then,

Ile not bet one peny.

The King hath Archers of his owne,

full ready and full light:

And theſe be ſtrangers euery one,

no man knowes what they hight.

What wilt thou bet ſaid Robin Hood,

thou ſeeſt our game the worſe:

By my ſiluer Miter ſaid the Biſhop then,

all my money within my Purſe.

What is in thy Purſe ſaid Robin Hood,

throw it downe on the ground,

Fiftéen ſcore nobles ſaid the Biſhop then,

it's neere an hundred pound.

Robin Hood tooke his bagge from his ſide,

and threw it downe on the gréene,

William Scadlock went ſmiling away,

I know who this money muſt win.

With that the Kings Archers led about,

while it was thrée and three,

With that the Ladies gaue a ſhout,

Woodcock beware thy née.

It is thrée and three. Now ſaid the King,

the next three pay for all:

Robin Hood went and whiſper'd to the Queen

the Kings part ſhall be but ſmall.

Robin Hood hee led about,

hee ſhot it vnder hand:

And Clifton with a baring Arrow,

hee cloue the willow wand.

And little Midge the Millers Son,

hee ſhot not much the worſe,

He ſhot within a finger of the prick,

now Biſhop beware thy purſe.

A boone, a boone, Queene Katherine cryed,

I craue that on my bare knée,

That you will angry be with none

that is of my partie.

They ſhall haue forty daies to come,

and forty daies to goe,

And three times forty to ſport and play,

then welcome friend or foe.

Then thou art welcome Robin Hood ſaid the Queene,

and ſo is little John,

So is Midge the Millers Son,

thrice welcome euery one.

Is this Robin Hood now ſaid the King?

for it was ſo told to mee,

That hee was ſlaine in Pallace gates,

ſo far in the North Country.

Is this Robin Hood ſaid the Biſhop then,

as I ſée well to be?

Had I knowne that had been that bold out-law

I would not bet one peny.

Hée tooke mee late one Saturday at night,

and bound mee faſt to a tree,

And made me ſing a maſſe, God wot,

to him and his Yeomen three.

What an if I did ſaies Robin Hood,

of that ma [...]e I was faine,

For recompence to thee hee ſaies,

here's halfe thy gold againe.

Now nay, now nay, ſaies little Iohn,

downe a downe a downe,

maſter that ſhall not be,

downe a downe a downe,

Wee muſt giue gifts to the Kings Officers,

that gold will ſerue thee and mee.

downe a downe a downe.

FINIS.
