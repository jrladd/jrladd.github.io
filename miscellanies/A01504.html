Therefore it is very necessary for a Souldier to take paines in daily practise, and to acquaint himselfe throughly in the exercise and carryage of Armes, whereof hee ought to vse practise, specially of those that bee offensiue, and in those which ordinarily wée are accustomed to carrie, as the Rapier, and Dagger, Pyke, and Halberd, with such like, without making open and apparant profession of the practise thereof, but secret and seuerall from the wide sight of the world, that afterwardes hee may put the same in practise to his greater aduantage and commendation.</p><p>Finally the Halberdier, who is armed either with Brigan­dine or Corslet, ought of dutie to attend with his Halberd when <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1167"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=10">[Page 10]</a></span> his turne comes about his ensigne, in marching, &amp; set Squares, in the Captaines Lodging and Tent for his guard, and at the entrance of a house &amp;c. to bée the formost person to force the pas­sage.</p><p>But in a day of battaile the old Romaine Shield and a short sharpe pointed sword, to execute in a throng of men, excéedes the Halberd and browne Bill.</p><p>Besides the pikeman which is armed all ouer with a Cors­let, and is to performe his dutie in a maine Square, stand o<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> Battaile, to receiue the shocke of horse men, or charge of the e­nemies infanterie.</p><p>There bee yet another sort of light armed Pikes, which only haue the forepart of a Corslet and a Headpéece, as is the Al­maine Riuet, or a good light Iacke, or plate Coate: these some­times may be sent amongst the forlorne hoope of Hargabusiers, to defend them from the inuasions of Horsemen.</p><p>But touching shot, I would wish our Nation, being men of strong constitution of bodie, to beare a Peece betwixt the boare of a Caliuer and a Musket, the which with smal vse they would be able to wéeld very well at the armes end, which would cary a great aduantage in skirmish: the which like vnto the Harga­buse, they might (as I said before) exercise, and with a galant and assured raising vp the crooked end of the stocke to his breast, hauing before hand fitted the Coale of his match to giue quick &amp; iust fire, wherof euer he must take y<sup>e</sup> certain measure, must then discharge amidst his modest trauerse, to his greatest aduantage, and to endomage his enemies: which done, he must first fold vp againe the <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>lne match in a ready and conuenient sort betwixt his fingers, hauing both the endes of his match light at once, that whilest the one is spent, and in kindling againe, the other may serue his turne.</p><p>Besides these foresaid weapons I would not thinke it incon­uenient, to haue in a band certaine Targets of proofe to march in y<sup>e</sup> front, which were very necessarie to defend a ranck of men in a streit lane, passage, breach, or other place from the enemies shot, they all closely and in a low order marching vnder the fa­uour and shade of them: as in askirmish I saw put in practise, when <span class="hi">Cassimire</span> did march with the States Armie vnder Lo­uaine▪ 1578.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1220"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=10">[Page 11]</a></span>The Captaine is to set downe by the Generals appoint­ment, the summe of all their paies, and the difference therein, according to euery mans weapon and qualitie.

As for example, hauing marched all day, and comming at night to the place where they must encampe, one of them choo­seth out the dryest and warmest plot of ground he can get in the quarter, which is appointed to his band for lodging place, doth kéepe all their Clokes, Armes and Baggage, whilest another makes prouision with one of their boyes, in some adioyning Uillage (if time and safety from the Enemie doth permit) for long straw, both to couer their Cabbin, and make their bedd of: during the time that an other with a litle Hatchet, which with a Lether Bottel for drinke, a litle Kettle to séeth meat in, and a bagge of Salt, which are to be borne of the Boyes amongest o­ther Baggage, and are most necessarie things for encamping, doth cut downe forked Bowes and long Poales to frame and reare vp their Cabbin withall, and prouide timber or firewood, if it be in Winter, or when neede requires, whilst an other doth visite <span class="hi">Viuandiers</span> and Uictualers (if any follow the Campe) for bread, drinke, and other eates, if otherwise they be not prouided by forrage or Picorée, and makes a hole in the earth, wherein <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1362"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=12">[Page 14]</a></span> hauing made a fire, stroken two forked stakes at either side, and hanged his Kettle to seath vpon a cudgel of wood vpon the same▪ or that for rost meat he makes a spit, woodden Gawberds, &amp;c. And whilst thus euery one is occupied about their necessarie occasions at one instant, they may in due time make prouision for all their wantes, and by meanes of this league of amitie a­mongst them, enioy a sufficient time to rest their wearied bo­dyes, which otherwise would be hard to be done.</p><p>Therefore I iudge it very requisite, that the whole number vnder the charge of a Desiner or chiefe of a chamber, should link themselues together in perfect friendship, and aswel in skirmish and fight aide one another, as in all other actions, by which in­uincible knot they should receaue wonderfull commoditie.</p><p>It importes much that a Souldier should bee tractable, for a man cannot imagine a thing either more ingenuqus or better, then due and conuenient ciuility. Therefore let him accustome himselfe rather to be of a Saturnine and seuere condition then a common skoffer, and an ordinarie make sport, that he may continue in friendship with his companions, and continually remaine in their amity.</p><p>Moreouer, he is much to be commended, which aptly with facilitie and great dexterity can bee conuersant with euery one: wherein if a man doe not with great iudgement very circumspectly gouerne himselfe, he shall for the most part in­curre the euill will of those in whose company he remaines. The which dealing is of great importance, aswell for the inte­rest of his life, and proper honor and credite, by which meanes the one and the other doth hang in Balance, as also for that he can not, being drawen away with debates, apply himselfe di­ligently to follow the warres and seruice of his Captaine: the which ought to bee his chiefest obiect and end. For discord a­mongst men of this Honorable profession, doth hasten, and occasion very much the destruction of their well doing, and altogether hinder whatsoeuer they take in hande, by rea­son of the suspicions, discordes, despite, and other respectes, which of necessity are commonly accustomed to growe and en­sue.</p><p>Besides, he must be so moderate in spending his wages, that <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e be not constrained before the midst of his pay, either to folow <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1399"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=12">[Page 15]</a></span> the spoile, or borrow of others: whereof springeth a naughtie reputation and a great discredite: yet notwithstanding he must not suffer himselfe to be noted for a couetous person, or as some say, the enimie of himselfe: that is, by sparing nigardly, to finde a great want &amp; extremitie in necessarie things appertaining to his apparell and victuals, whose expences ought chiefely to be in galant Armor and Furniture.</p><p>Note that the pay and wages which he receiues of his Cap­taine and Treasurer, must not be taken or thought to serue or supplie for any other vse, but to sustaine life with victuals, kéepe him apparelled, and maintaine his armes. Therefore ought it to be gouerned discréetly and orderly at all times, in what place so euer he shall remaine, either in the campe, ciuile cities, or in his proper house, as well to kéepe himselfe in health, as chiefely to make apparant to his Captain the noble motion of his mind: So that pricked forward by this spurre of honor, and not for any other extraordinarie and base occasion, a good souldier is conti­nually constrained to winne credite, despising all other dealing which ariseth for hope of commoditie and gréedy gaine, the way to make a man estéemed to carrie a base minde, and almost not disagréeing from brute beasts without reason. For these priuate souldiers which séeke by such meanes as be extraordinarie, to aduance themselues aboue their proper pay, without doubt giue an euill presage of themselues, and so euil, that it should be bet­ter for them to applie their time in some other sort, as about merchandise and other occupations, rather then follow the ho­norable exercise of Armes, which is altogither grounded vpon a noble mind, valiant courage, and extreame trauell of bodie.</p><p>He must dispose himselfe to be verie diligent in what exercise or enterprise soeuer he shall be put vnto, as to make <span class="hi">Sentinel:</span> wherein it is conuenient, as I haue touched before, that he be verie vigilant when it is his lot to be commanded thereunto, that in doing the contrarie, there succéede not a most rigorous chastisement by leauing his bodie dead behind him, as it may verie well fall out, and to whom it may be said, I left him as I found him, since sléepe is the image of death.</p><p>A good souldier ought continually to accompanie the Ensigne, and haue speciall regard, that the same fall not in danger of sur­prising by the enimie, and that he endeuour himselfe by all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1420"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=13">[Page 16]</a></span> meanes without anie respect of danger to preserue and recouer the same: for the losse thereof is a perpetuall shame to the whole band. And therefore he ought at no time to abandon the same for anie occasion, but lodge himselfe so néere it as he can, to the intent that amongst y<sup>e</sup> rest, if it be possible, he may be one of the first at all rumours of armes, and sodaine alarums, aswel by day as night. And being armed with the weapon he caries, hauing conducted his ensigne to the place appointed, by the head offi­cers, he may in the sight of his captaine (shewing a moderate for­wardnesse and desire) bréed an opinion of his courage and valor: so that when occasion doth offer, his captaine amongst the rest may make speciall choyse of him.</p><p>He must for no occasion absent himselfe, or go to anie far di­stant place about anie enterprise or bootie of picorée, without the expresse licence of his captaine: for he that is once become a soul­dier is now no more his own man, but his vnder whose gouern­ment he is paid: who desiring to serue his turne when occasions be ministred in time of warres, not hauing his valiant and best souldiors present and readie about him, shal not onely be made frustrate of that he would performe, but sometimes also suffer and sustaine damage, and onely in respect of those which be ab­sent abroad at their owne pleasure, contrarie to the consent and knowledge of the captaine.</p><p>He ought sufficiently to eate, rest, and sléep, whilest time doth permit, to the end he be not called for vnprouided, and that he may the more readily performe all enterprises néedfull, without anie discommoditie or want of abilitie, which commonly do fall out vnlooked for, and vpon the sodaine, for in ordinarie and ac­customed enterprises, it is an easie thing to find euerie soul­dier prouided, but in sodaine surprises not. Besides, I thinke it appertains and is proper to a good souldior, to follow the wars so long as he possibly can, for the increase of his experience. But being constrained to returne into his countrie, or into any citie, fortresse or other place of defence, by reason of some truce, seconded by peace, or through anie other accident, which doth constraine him to abandon the warres: then it is necessarie he fall to exercise that art, wherein he chiefly hath bene brought vp, either in merchandise, handicraft, or husbandrie, or else whatsoeuer, thereby to supply his necessities, to exercise his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1445"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=13">[Page 17]</a></span> bodie and to liue honestly: and by that meanes flie idlenesse, a thing most incident to youth: who being altogither igno­rant in treading the steppes of a stayed life (through the small experience he hath of the world, which by tract of time is obtai­ned, and by long practise, specially in the exercise of Armes) per­swades himselfe he shall win credite and commoditie through the meanes of insolent actions, which altogither ought to be ab­horred: through rash and prodigall brauerie, which oftentimes torments innocent families and poore parentes: and through galant garments and sumptuous attyre, whereby they grow banckrout: so that they are brought in time (being intangled in those swéete traps sauest with sharpe showers) to run headlong into a thousand &amp; most miserable ruines. Therefore good souldi­ers ought specially to endeuour themselues by some commen­dable industrie, to gaine the good grace of valorous and valiant Captaines, and mightie Princes, the true possessors and fathers of warre, through whose authoritie and commendation they may be preferred: for the faith and assured credite of all war­like and worthy souldiers doth depend vpon men of valor, and not of the weake authoritie, small valor, and great abuse of the ignorant &amp; common people, called the beast with many heads. Therefore let them euer obserue the honor of the good and ver­tuous: for since that in time of warres euerie souldier of good conditions doth sharpen his wit, &amp; willingly aduēture his life, not respecting toyles or trauell, expences or danger, but doth imploy his industrie to preferre his princes profite, by great reason in time of peace he ought to be aduanced and maintai­ned by them: and much the more for himselfe, is to vse all his indeuour to compasse his owne commoditie, and thereby make manifest his proper vertue, the which doth not consist in out­ward appearance of valour and discretion: but in the true acti­on thereof, agréeable to his honorable profession.</p><p>A souldier must apparell himselfe in the warres with cloth of fresh coulour, profitable and commodious: amongst the rest, red, murrey, tauney, and scarlet makes a galant shew in the fielde, which he must weare to honour the Militarie profession, and for his most fit and apt wearing, and not to hinder the disposi­tion of his members, as doth our great bumbasted and <span class="unclear">bulstered[?]</span> hoose, which not many yeares since hath béene vsed: but in stéede <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1481"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=14">[Page 18]</a></span> of them a straite brabantie and gascaine is to be we<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ne, togi­ther with a close Cassocke, which may shield both his <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>, tuch­boxe, his match and péece from raine if néede be, whereby he may be readie to execute any enterprise he is commanded to per­forme, and that of necessitie he ought to do: and so arme him­selfe in other respectes, that he may redily do any seruice he is assigned vnto.</p><p>He must be willing to put in proofe all things commanded, without making replie, or denying any one thing, or deferring <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> matter from one time to another, either for feare of spoiling or spotting his apparel in foule way, or foule weather, or y<sup>t</sup> he shal not be able to inioy commodious lodging, store of victuals, &amp; such other respects, not to be estéemed of, but worthy great reprehen­sion. Therefore it is requisite he practise himselfe first of all to be a perfect priuate souldier, before he be drawne to the desire of bearing office, which were to set the cart before the horses, and worke by contraries: For first we must learne to guid, and then is it lawfull to gouerne. But it is no new thing, nor to be maruelled at, that some men are accustomed to obtaine charges by vnlawfull and indirect meanes, I will not say, that they vse them accordingly. Therefore to merite a charge, it is alwayes farre more excellent and more conuenient to winne them by de­sert, then to enter thereinto by intrusion: for those that doe not beg them do feele in themselues their proper sufficiencie: where contrariwise they are a heauie burthen to those that know them not, although with great instance they haue procured &amp; sought for them. Which want and vnwarie dealing in this our age, peraduenture procéeds of the small néede the world séemes to haue of good souldiers at this day, and of the little experience most men in our time haue of the art of warre, or at least wise our superiours are blinded with the sweete baites of couetous­nesse, chiefe cause of such elections. Yet this notwithstanding we ought to retaine with al reuerence, the honour &amp; credite due to an expert and good souldier, who with diligence being sought for &amp; selected, as neere as is possible, ought to haue the most chosē charges, and expeditions giuen to their gouernmēt. To the end those affaires may fal out happily, to the honor of their nation &amp; profite of their Prince, whilest he doth follow the wars, or is in Campe: let him carrie as little baggage with him as is possi­ble, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1524"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=14">[Page 19]</a></span> that he may be the more nimble and light of bodie, spée­die in his iourney or marching, and the more apt for all enter­prises.</p><p>During the warres (or else not) he ought to weare in some conuenient place of his garments, that is most apparant to the view of y<sup>e</sup> band, a token, red crosse, or scarfe, whereby in skir­mishes and other attemps he is to be knowne of what part he is. The Emperials vse a red scarfe, Englishmen saint <span class="hi">Georges</span> crosse, the French the white crosse, <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span>. or such a signe as the Ge­nerall of the fielde shall make choice of, which he ought to doe willingly, thereby to remoue suspition out of the mind of his Captaine and Chieftaines, that they néede not to stand in doubt of him: and for diuers other worthie respects, since that by these and like manifest meanes, the souldier shewes inward faith &amp; loyaltie to the officers and Captaines which gouerne. But if otherwise they carrie the said token and marke loose at their necke, brest, armes, or any other place, it giues matter and oc­casion of doubt touching their sidelitie: specially being but new­ly entertained, since that not being made fast, they may easily cast away or hide the same in time of perill or doubtfull fight: which suspicion ought diligently to be remoued by him which carrieth an entire desire and full intent to deale truly &amp; loyally.</p><p>He ought likewise to beware, vnder paine of great punish­ment, for running from one campe to another, for what occasion soeuer shal vrge him to it, but is bound to serue that partie with which he doth first place himselfe, euen vntill the ende of the warres.</p><p>I haue séene it likewise not lawfull, that a captaine should receiue into his seruice a souldier that is departed from another Captaine of the same faction, and this was obserued, to the end that souldiers should be kept obedient and stedfast vnder their Ensigne, where first they haue placed themselues. Prouided al­wayes, that their Captaines intreate them honestly and well, which is to be decided by the Marshall of the field. Neuertheles, so often as a souldier is forced of necessity to leaue the warres, he ought not to depart out of his seruice, but by the speciall ly­cence of his captain, accompanied with an autentike pasport of his good seruice, so shal he shun many cōfusions which are great occasions of scādals &amp; infinite troubles, by means wherof he may <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1568"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=15">[Page 20]</a></span> fréely make relation of the good seruice he hath done, and boldly shew himselfe before any mans face.</p><p>He ought to take special care, that he be not the beginner and occasion of any discordes and mutinies, neither consent there­vnto, what reason soeuer should lead him thereunto, since that such peruerse proceeding doth not agrée with the worthie, noble, and famous art of war, which is a dangerous discredite to such malefactors, and for the most part without any recouerie doth procure the generall ruine of many valiant Captaines &amp; migh­tie armies. And therfore ruffians and common hackers that liue idle in the stréetes at home, and follow the wars onely for spoile▪ are most vnfit to make souldiers, for experience makes manifest, that they are the onely cause of mutin<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>s, so that one such is able to corrupt and disorder a whole band. Wherefore a good souldier ought rather to applie himselfe to suffer things impossible, then commit so great an error, for by the one great honour and praise shall redound vnto him, and by the other vile act, he shall gaine manifest blame and assured death: for such notable errors, with­out any remission, or any pity (as in part I haue before touched, and her easter in the marshal Lawes shal set downe) are seuere­ly to be chastised.</p><p>When the companie doth disband, and euerie souldier is to go to his lodging or cabbin, it is verie requisite he stay vntill such time as he see the Ensigne lapt vp and lodged, to the intent, if he be of the gard about the same, that night he may attend to do his dutie, otherwise he may lawfully depart, &amp; thereby shun the shamful name of a stubborne, licentious &amp; disobedient persō.</p><p>He must learne to vnderstand the assured sound of the drum, thereby to know alwayes whereunto he is appointed, and what thing is to be done and obeyed, which of duetie is accustomed to be done, since that with this instrument souldiers are giuen to vnderstand, during the warres, what things be necessarie to be executed. One thing besides is most necessarie for a souldier, which is, that he learne perfitly to swim, both for that waters cānot alwayes be passed with wading, neither at al times boats &amp; bridges can be conueyed with the campe, by reason of naughty passages, as also in diuers enterprises a man is both more safe and more bold, knowing what he can do: whereof young <span class="hi">Shelley</span> made a most famous proofe, who at y<sup>e</sup> victualing of <span class="hi">Midleborow,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1607"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=15">[Page 21]</a></span> when their nanie was assaulted by the Flushingers, hauing all his companie slaine, swam a shore with his armes, being the last man left aliue a shipbord: and as the Spaniards at the pas­sage of the arme of the sea, when they went to besiege Siricke seas. Besides the notable attempt made at the great riuer of <span class="hi">Alba</span> in <span class="hi">Saxonie,</span> the yeare 1547. where the Imperialists had so famous and glorious a victorie.</p><p>Now therefore let no man perswade himselfe, that the seue­rall and particular experience which belongs to a perfect good souldier, can be perfectly and duely obtained by anie other way, but by a continuall delight, exercise, and obseruation: for no man doth bring any worke to perfection, whereof he hath not the art: euerie art doth spring of experience and knowledge, and knowledge doth arise by meanes of studie and continuall practise. Militarie profession being then more perfect and aboue all other arts, consequently it is necessarie we vse in the same greater studie, and more continuall exercise then is to be vsed in any other art: for somuch as it is a most ancient and pru­dent sentence: All arts do consist in exercise: and therfore conti­nually at idle times it is verie fit and necessarie for a souldier, to practise and exercise himselfe amongst his companions in the campe, in running, leaping, throwing the barre, or such like, to make him actiue, and to auoid such idle pastimes as souldiers commonly now a daies vse, contrarie to all good order.</p><p>Besides which, as I haue partly touched before, euery priuate souldier ought not only to be well able to vse the weapon he ser­ueth withall, but also sodainly to vnderstand all cōmandements of his gouernors, whether it be by voice or sound of drum or o­therwise, and to know how to maintein himselfe in order with­out breaking aray, not onely marching, but also turning in a troupe or retyring. For that souldier which knoweth his dutie how to behaue himselfe in the campe, in watch, scout, &amp;c. and likewise in marching, turning, retyring, and fighting or skir­mishing to obserue the order prescribed by his captaine, may be called a trained and old souldier: whereof if he be ignorant, al­though he haue bene twentie yeares in the warres, he is not to be estéemed a souldier.

But in other places not néedfull so much to be suspected, and that be néerer him, he ought to set <span class="hi">Sentinels</span> with the watch-word, so farre one from an other, as it shal seeme vnto him reasonable or requisit, &amp; that they may inu<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ron the ground one within y<sup>e</sup> sight of another, or so y<sup>t</sup> the enemy cānot enter, or any espion issue without their knowledge.

Let him march then with a good grace, holding vp his head galantly, his pace full of graui­tie and state, and such as is fit for his person, and let his bodie be straight and as much vpright as is possible, and that which most imports, is that they haue alwayes their eyes vpon their companions which are in rancke with them, and before them, going iust one with the other, &amp; kéeping perfite distance with­out committing error in the least pace or step, and euerie pace and motion with one accord and consent, they ought to make at one instant time.

Therefore to the end his order and ranckes may be to the purpose duely and directly changed, and with facilitie disposed: let him euer disseuer and deuide one part of his wea­pons from another, causing euery one to turne and enter into their ranckes and order by themselues, so shall he procéed in ta­king away, setting forward, and intermixing one sort of rancks within another very orderly.

Therefore fit and conuenient places are to be obserued with humilitie, the naked in their places, and the armed in theirs: but to touch one point which we haue alredie spoken of, I iudge it most conuenient that the armed (those for skirmish excepted) must remaine in <span class="hi">Maine</span> stands and battailes, as some say, so abide by the stake, who ought to be so wel armed as they may beare and support the blowes of their enimies, and resist any furious charge, either of horsemen or sootemen.

He must like­wise haue diligent eye, that the said munition of match &amp; pow­der be conserued warily from wetting, and kept with a speciall spare from vntimely spending: for this prouident precept doth import verie much in all enterprises, by reason that the negli­gence of the Sergeant, touching this necessarie foresight &amp; care, hath bene the cause that the shot haue not bene able readily to performe their duties according to the appointed determinati­ons, or as necessitie did require, by reason of their vnwarie kée­ping their munition in wet weather, or their generall want through vain mispence, by which meanes many &amp; most notable <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>rrors haue succéeded of great losse and moment, &amp; to the hinde­rance, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3388"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=34">[Page 59]</a></span> shame, and totall ruine of a whole companie or campe.

Therefore as occasion doth serue and offer, he may admonish, put in minde, and reprehend with dexteritie the souldiers vnder his charge and guiding. To him it apper­taines to lay his helping hand about al things necessarie for his companie, as well in prouiding for them, as dispencing, or de­ferring necessarie charges, except for the prouision and deuiding of lodgings, which is the office of the Furrier or Harbinger, who ought to be very tractable, diligent, &amp; altogither officious, not being partial to any one for peculiar profite or pleasure, and therfore it is necessarie a Sergeant should know how to write, for it is hard by memorie to discharge his charge.</p><p>The Sergeant must be careful to accompanie, at the houre ap­pointed, the guard to the place of the watch, in going vp and downe alongst their stanckes when he hath placed them in or­der, to sée them kéepe due distance, make the <span class="hi">Laumband,</span> march in straight line, with their ranckes carrie their armes in con­formable proportion: and if vpon pleasure they giue a volée of shot in passing, to aduertise them to doe it orderly with due forme, one rancke after another, as they passe ouer against the Generall, or other great officer or personage, and not in a confused sort altogither, or by péeces.</p><p>When he is arriued at the Corps of gard, and hath placed euery one in order, and prouided for all things necessarie for the watch of that night, he must then giue his aduise and counsell to the Corporals, that they kéepe good order in their <span class="hi">Sentinels,</span> yea sometimes and verie often, it is good that he himselfe aide them to choose out the most fit places for them to stand in, to the end that the circuit of ground, which for all their safties is to be kept, may be conueniently garded.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3424"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=35">[Page 60]</a></span>At the ioyning of the day &amp; the night, or somwhat later, he shal secretly giue the Corporals the watchword, with the which they are to gouerne the gard as wel by night as day: the which word by the commandement of his Captaine, he must procure the Sergeant maior to giue him, or of some other that shall haue the charge to giue the same for want of his presence, or in place of this great officer.</p><p>He must arme himselfe in such sort, that he be no lesse apt then any other souldier to be able at time of néed, both to defend him­selfe, and offend the enimie: touching which effect, Duke <span class="hi">Octa­u<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>o Farnese</span> in the expedition of 12000▪ footemen and 600. horse­men, which Paulus the third Pope of Rome sent into Germa­nie against the Lutherans in aid of <span class="hi">Charles</span> the fift, did dispose, that all the Sergeants of his bands should arme themselues with hargabuzes and murrians: saying, that so great a number of valiant men being Sergeants, as was in so great an assem­blie and expedition of such importance, it was neither good nor commendable, that they should onely be armed with their hal­berds, and therefore he ought to haue his Page or <span class="hi">Muchacho</span> second him with those furnitures: Neither séemes it inconue­nient, but hauing placed in order all things pertaining to his office, that he place himselfe in ranke with the rest of the soul­diers, yet in such a place as he may easily depart from thence when necessitie calles him away, to reforme or vse remedie to any disorder he vnderstands of.</p><p>He must with dexteritie procéed in reprehending and exhor­ting the souldiers to kéepe their due order, and not to disband and stray abroad, but vpon néedfull and lawfull occasions, and to take order in all other particular points, which are requisite to be obserued for the honour and profite of the companie, which thinges are chiefely to be procured and obserued by other of­ficers.</p><p>Let him beware and abstaine from beating of souldiers at any time, that thereby he grow not odius: for it is not conue­nient nor comely for an officer to strike a souldier, for thereby he so offends, that he doth incurre the paine to receiue pu­nishment for so doing, of his Captaine or the master of the Campe.</p><p>He must be diligent, carefull, and vigilant in all his affaires, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3475"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=35">[Page 61]</a></span> for in this office, diligence and dexteritie is both to the purpose and most necessarie.</p><p>It is necessarie he be alwaies conformable vnto the sergeant Maior, by imitation and obedience in action, and like his sha­dow, to second him in all his doings: Of whom he may alwaies receiue information and order of all such things as be necessary for seruice of his band.

For al­though the enterprise did fall out to the aduantage of the same partie, yet if there should follow the losse of any famous and no­table person, the same hath not onely bene of great domage, but also hath bene oftentimes of such force, that it hath stroken a terror and feare in the minds of the souldiers, specially amongst those that were not at the enterprise, neither in like cases will it satisfie or suffice them to declare or solemnely expresse vnto them the truth, but that vpon such special losse, they will grow into vnaduised iudgementes and timerous dispositi­ons.</p><p>If in case the enimie take the charge and malte retyre, it is good to haue takē order with the <span class="hi">Caualliers,</span> heads &amp; guids of the skirmish, that as néere as possible they can, they force their peo­ple to make stay, and that they follow the enimie no further, since that in this point they do not contend to any other end, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5692"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=64">[Page 120]</a></span> then to bréede a certaine impression and good opinion in the minds of our owne souldiers, to the confusion of the contrarie part, and to winne aduertisements, if it be possible, the which is all the effect they haue to performe, the which was the onely motion that moued them to attempt this enterprise.</p><p>Now when he determines to gaine a passage, or any other strong place against the enimie, which will arise to their dis­profite and our owne commoditie, and hauing wonne it, to su­staine and defend the same: first choise must be made of a vigi­lant and valiant leader, although it hath often fallen out that without entring into skirmish a diligent captaine or leader, hath with his people taken possession of such passages or strong places. And by this prouidence, it ariseth to be neither difficile nor hard to be defended against the enimie, considering that all such suspected extremities &amp; bands, be accustomed to be strong by nature, whereunto afterwards ioyning some little Art, for the most part they become expugnable. But neuerthelesse if by incountring with the enimie it is requisite he should skirmish, I iudge it verie good that he should rashly go no further, then so farre as the souldiers which he hath sent to the skirmish haue gained.</p><p>To obserue perfite gouernement, it is neuer good to depart from the order before rehersed, saue onely when he doth sée the enimie bend and shrinke away, in place of aduised stay &amp; polli­tike retention in procéeding, I thē iudge it worthie cōmendati­on to follow the victorie, but for al that, with such consideration and so aduisedly, that their ouer-great courage and carelesse ioy be not the occasion of disorder and confusion, togither with the which prosperitie, he must diligently procure his people to gaine the passage or strong place, to the end if the enimy should go about to succour his flying and broken people, he become not a let and hinderance to his determination.</p><p>It is verie requisite he likewise note, that when the enimie is so fresh and of such force, that it is impossible to ouerthrow or repulse him face to face: then shall it be to the purpose to mo­derate the same euen vntill night, at which time he must vse al the pollicies and stratagems he can possible to performe his de­termination: for the onely marke whereat this leader must shoote, must onely be to worke such meanes as he may gaine <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5720"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=64">[Page 121]</a></span> the passage, and take possession of the strong place, and not to passe the time in skirmish and fight: hauing wonne the same, he must indeuour himselfe to defend and repaire it, that they may be able to resist all the furie and force that the enimie is a­ble to make, vntill such time as succours come to him from his campe.</p><p>When he is of minde to entertaine and kéepe the enimie oc­cupied, to the intent he march nor iourney not at his pleasure, or that if your armie doe march, he worke not any domage to your people, to your baggage, to your munitions &amp; other things of importance: It is verie expedient that the leader of this skir­mish be valiant and wise: who must determine to keepe occu­pied the enimie, that by the practise thereof it may arise to bee profitable to the performance of some other his purposed enter­prise.</p><p>After he hath made choise amongst his souldiers of those which must skirmish, he must deuide them as is before rehersed: and he with the rest of the people to him vnited, as néere as is possi­ble, must march alongst the strongest situation of the ground, &amp; then must send those that are deputed and appointed to the skir­mish, one after another to the taile of the enimies battel, against whom they must skirmish and fight, euen as an old beaten dog about some Bul or furious beast doth here and there snatch, bite and turne about him, that in the end he doth kéepe him occupied &amp; wearie him, if not ouercome. When he hath put these things in execution, he must gather togither his people in the best sort he can, in the aforesaid order.</p><p>If in marching his owne campe doe feare to be assaulted at the backe, or that he hath suspicion of his baggage, or doubts some impediments on the flankes: then must the leader of the skirmish make repaire with his people to that place, where hee suspects the enimie will take aduantage: and march farre off, and with such distance from his campe and his battailes, as he shall thinke conuenient, and as the nature of the place doth re­quire, to the intent he may bring to effect his determination, and prosecute the same to a good end, the which is to auoid the inconuenience, that the enimy neither hurt nor hinder his bag­gage and munition. And in this sort with good order he must follow and accompany his owne people, and with those that be <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5747"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=65">[Page 122]</a></span> appointed for the fight, must kéepe occupied and intertaine the enimy stil skirmishing, retyring, and marching as it alwayes fals out and chanceth to him that valiantly defends him­selfe.</p><p>Concluding then, I say, that it séemes good and verie requi­site that the skirmish for the most part should be fled and shun­ned, except it be in respect of some of the thrée foresaid occasions, or some such like, which thereunto may be adioyned, procéeding of a practised and aduised iudgement, for it is a verie rash and vnaduised thing to loose men of valour to no purpose, as of ne­cessitie in skirmishes doth succéede. And besides the losse of such persons of estimation, which ariseth by reason of rash disorder: Moreouer it hath bene oftentimes séene, that whilest he goeth about to succour one band presently enclosed by the enimie and put to flight (by reason it hath bene negligently gouerned, as for the most part it fals out, whē men go to skirmish moued by a fantastical rage, vain ambition, and to smal purpose without a sufficient appointed chiefe or head, or rather without speciall commission from the captaine Generall, the which aduertise­ment is principally to be noted) there hath such inconuenience succéeded, that an armie hath sometimes bene constrained to ha­zard and come to the fight of a maine battell vpon a suddaine, a thing maruellous perillous, and that ought of necessitie to be fled, without manifest aduantage of a perfite and a well practi­sed Generall.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.20"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.20. </span><span class="head">Sundrie aduertisements fit for a worthie Cauallier to obserue.</span></h4><ul><li class="item">1 First in the view of a batterie.</li><li class="item">2 Secondly in describing the condition of a situation of any place.</li><li class="item">3 And thirdly in disclosing the order the enimie obserues, either encamping or marching.</li></ul><p>Although an excellent and prudent captaine Generall in all his affaires must vse the seruice of practised souldiers, such as may be supposed to haue sufficient knowledge in these afore­said respects: yet doe I coniecture it verie necessarie to make choise of a man that besides his sufficient experience in diuerse <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5783"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=65">[Page 123]</a></span> warlike practises of training, ordering, directing, and leading souldiers, yet would I wish the said worthy <span class="hi">Cauallier</span> to carrie a hautie and hardie heart, a bold and valiant bodie, and more­ouer that he be accompanied with an excellent iudgement in matters appertaining to the exercise of Armes: specially in those causes cōuenient to be accomplished by him or his equals.

The which obseruation shal bring to passe that the soul­diers in marching and in other enterprises shall go togithers, and be vnited about the Ensigne, which is a thing most conue­nient and necessarie, and ought greatly to be shunned, for that horses by ouerthwart trauersing are accustomed to deface th<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> squares, and break the rankes of the footemens battailes, which truely is verie odious and of great disturbance and discommo­ditie: but that which I speake of this extraordinarie band is to be vnderstood and taken, when there is no ordinarie bands of horsemen ioyned to a Collonels Regiment.</p><p>He ought to take vigilant care that the Gentlemen of his band and <span class="hi">Caualliers</span> of his squadre, being continually about his person do diligently performe, that which they are appointed of him to do by commission or otherwise, and that they make faith­full and true relation to him of euerie particular thing, that hée may be euer fully informed of all things, and chiefly of that which doth passe in the watch worthy &amp; necessarie to be noted, as wel by day as by night▪ since that by going the Round, which doth appertaine principally to these <span class="hi">Caualliers,</span> many things of moment &amp; importance may verie well be obserued, being able to execute any of the inferiour offices, &amp; both quickly conceiue and sensibly vtter any new accident.</p><p>The Collonel must most carefully with humble courtisie court his captaine generall, vse great respect towards him, obey him, &amp; giue him faithfull counsell: and to the end he may performe this thorowly well, he must neuer refuse toile or trauell, since that to take pain about matters of like importance, is agréeable and conuenient to honorable personages his equals, whereas easie delicacie &amp; curiositie appertaines to women, or other effe­minate persons, who estéeme more of belly cheere, gallant at­tyre and riches, then of the péerelesse prise of valor &amp; vertue, and that prefer a fraile bodie before an immortall soule.</p><p>Some hold opinion that a Collonel hauing to allot ou<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> what number of pikes, short weapons, and shot is to be in euery band, that it is farre better to haue but one sort of weapons, so shall the Captaine euer accompanie his owne souldiers, whereas <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7184"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=84">[Page 156]</a></span> otherwise they being disseuered in a stand battaile, he must ei­ther loose the companie of his shot or pykes, the one of them be­ing committed to a second, and the short weapons to a third, which doth nothing so much encourage the souldier, as to see his Captaine companion of his perils, and the contrarie no lesse dismaieth him: but for that foughten fields chance seldome in our time, I cease to wade further therein, only aduertising that amongst the rest of his souldiers, the armed pikes must be gent­ly vsed, shewing them a chéerefull and good countenance, who must be chosen men, verie hardie and valiant.</p><p>He must procure that his officers diligently performe his co­missions, and that faithfully they make relation of euerie par­ticular thing, that he may be enformed of all, &amp; in specially that which happens in wards, as well in the day as in the night, for they going in circuit as appertaines vnto them, may well per­ceiue what chanceth of any great importance.

And as the quantitie &amp; number of Pikes, principally togither with other short wea­pons, is the verie strength &amp; force of the armed footemen: So the musketeares &amp; hargabusiers, serue to no other end but to flank, to raise ruine &amp; deface all defences, to make imbuscades, to skir­mish diligently to execute such like enterprises: and finally to pursue y<sup>e</sup> enimy, defending or expugning some strong place, for­tresse, passage, or breach, or what other condition soeuer. When he hath put the ordenance and march in this foresaid forme and maner, &amp; that he doth carry in mind y<sup>e</sup> Theorick &amp; Rules which before are mentioned, he may so ingrosse and double the ranks, specially when he aspects and stayes for the enimie, that he may frame▪ the square battaile of ground or of number a<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>d of men, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7562"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=89">[Page 168]</a></span> both the one and the other, without any difficultie.</p><p>He may likewise cause euerie particular Sergeant place all the Pikes armed and disarmed, with the other weapons they haue in charge, and also the Ensigne, in so many li<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>es &amp; rankes as the people of the other bands likewise armed by their Ser­geant are formed and fashioned. Besides it would be very good for the Sergeant Maior, first of all, aduisedly to consider with the Sergeants, how many lines or ranks they are to be by com­panie: prouided alwayes that one band be like vnto another in quantitie of lines &amp; rankes, that their proportion may answere and be correspondent. These bodies so ordained, are of many called maniples or scales, as thus.</p><div class="figure"><i>[figure]</i></div><p> which verie easily may be ingrossed thus, </p><div class="figure"><i>[figure]</i></div><p> And in this sort shal he cause one band to march behind another, being annexed and ioyned néere togither, and that euery one of thē be guided by an officer into a place &amp; ground able to receiue them, causing the first company and maniple to march somwhat disseuered from the other, &amp; to make space &amp; stay, he may ordaine that the second comming forward it may be placed vpon his flanke: so in like sort shal the third to the second, the 4. to the 3. &amp; the 5. to the 4. and so consequently continuing this order, he shal by &amp; by forme a grosse square and gallant battell, that with ad­uantage may be able to contend with the enimie. And it is true y<sup>t</sup> some haue affirmed, that the fewer number of maniples there be, the case is so much better, but in this case it is very hard to obserue the iust order of so many men by rank, &amp; of such number of ranks as the perfect rules of Theorick doth assigne, by reason that many times all the companies and bands are not of equall number, neither are they all armed alike one to another.</p><p>Marching in this order he may cause al the <span class="hi">Alfieres</span> of euerie Regiment to march in ranke vnited togither, without mixing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7593"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=89">[Page 171]</a></span> themselues with others that pertain to other Collonels, or with other priuate captains, and when the maniple be doubled &amp; the battel is complet &amp; engrossed, euery <span class="hi">Alfierus</span> may go to his own band, and remain with the same, for the more satisfaction of his company and his greater saftie. And returning with the said or­der of maniples to march in long ordinance as before, euery <span class="hi">Al­fierus</span> shal turne amongst the other <span class="hi">Alfierus</span> or Ensigne bearers where he remained first. The Hargabusiers must march disseuered from the battaile, the one halfe in Uantgard, and the other half in reargard, or somwhat distant of, vpon y<sup>e</sup> right hand, &amp; vpon the left hand, as the way shall serue with most commo­ditie, or as shall be thought most necessarie, if suspect be had of the enimie, so that according as néede doth require, redoubling the rankes, and causing one to enter into another, or knit and ioyne togither, he may engrosse them and put them in order with good aduisement, to flanke this foresaid principall battaile in as good forme as he possible may.</p><p>It is a most necessarie note to be had in memorie, that as wel the two wings or sléeues of Hargabusiers, as also the front or backe part of the ordained battaile or generall square, are al­wayes recommended, as before I said, to the worthy Collonels and Captaines, and honorable officers and souldiers, to the in­tent they may alwayes giue remedie, by discourse consider, and by courage determine of al matters, making choise of the chiefest part in those affaires of importance, without attending or aspe­cting for counsell▪ if in case such counsell be not present and rea­die at hand.</p><p>Neither is it to be misliked or out of course, but as I iudge a thing verie necessarie to send for Uantgard and Reargard, and on both sides some what farre off from the battaile, squadrons, troopes or hornes of Hargabusiers out of the forlorne hope: the which without mouing the souldiers of the battaile, the ordai­ned square and flankes may verie sufficiently performe all en­terprises, discoueries, and do great seruice of maruellous impor­tance and profite, and in effect may assure the way and passage to the squadrons that come behind or go before from surprises, &amp;c. Marching out of danger or suspicion of the enimy, the Ser­geant Maior deuiding euerie armes by themselues, must forme the accustomed ordinance, and marching with this, hée may <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7637"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=90">[Page 168]</a></span> accept the companies which ariue, as they come, and send the Hargabusiers of the front of this companie to the Uantgard of the Hargabusiers of the foresaid formed rankes, and those of the backe to the reargard: the Ensignes to the place of the Ensignes and the forepart of the Pikes and Halberds to the front, and the hindermost part to the backe of this square battaile and ordinance: in the midst of the day when the Armie makes <span class="hi">Al<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span></span> to rest, in the morning when they dislodge, and at night when they encampe, let the Sergeant Maior accompanied with the Marshall of the fielde, range the armie into sundrie formes of battailes and squares, that ech one may be well acquainted with euerie sort of battaile, the which although part of them be not to march withall, and not in vse, yet for exercise sake, and for that sometimes they are found to be profitable, when they are diligētly ordained and disposed, being conformable to the situa­tion of the ground, and correspondent to that present enterprise, specially when they be contained and framed of a great number of people, I haue thought good in my figures hereunto annexed, to set downe some of old and some of newe inuentions, hoping that some of them may satisfie our curious conceited Captaines. But to delate further of these foresaid particulars, the Sergeant Maior must euerie day repaire to the Lord high marshal, or the Lieutenant generall, to receiue direction in what sort that day the armie is to march, whose pleasures knowne, he must, as <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> said before, sort euery kind of weapon by it selfe, and then dra<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> them forth in maniples or sléeues, in 3. 5. 02 7. in a ranke, or mor<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> as occasion serues, and so to place euerie band that their Cap taines may be with them to direct and animate them, which i<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> these our dayes is almost impossible to be done, euery smal ban<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> being deuided into seuerall weapons, so that he cannot in time of such generall seruice accompanie his owne band, which sure­ly is repugnant to antique Discipline.</p><p>Some hold opinion, vnlesse the souldiers bee rawe and vn­trained men, that it is not good to aduenture the brunt, in one maine square battaile, but rather in diuers squadrons and sundrie battillions, specially if by the continuance of many yeares seruice they be trained in such sort, as in the furie of the fight they can both march forward if they preuaile, or retyre vp­on disaduantage, and yet maintaine perfectly their arayes: then <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7681"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=90">[Page 169]</a></span> by no meanes the battaile is to be committed to one hazard of fortune, but imitating the <span class="hi">Romaines</span> ancient warlike discipline, to place themselues in thrée or foure seuerall fronts, with con­uenient spaces for the first to retire and vnite himselfe with the second, &amp; both these (if occasion néede) to serue with the 3. the shot hauing conuenient issues and lanes, continually during the fight, to discharge their péeces, which will make an incredible spoile of the enimie, so that vpon the charge of horsemen rety­ring within the squadrons, who ioyning togither may bend and crosse their pikes to receiue the shocke, and repulse them, vp­on whose retyre, vnclosing their thorowfares, lanes, and gal­leries againe, the shot and musketeares may issue out vpon their backes, and either follow with the heat shore of their bul­lets, or he imployed vpon some other enterprises: but these things cannot be accomplished without long abode in warres &amp; 7. yeares seruice at the least of an armie in sundrie hazards of fights and battailes.</p><p>Therefore it is necessarie for the Sergeant Maior, in time of rest when the enimie is absent, to cause the bands to assemble, and to put them in sundrie sorts of standing and marching bat­tailes, to reduce them sometimes into small squadrons of 400. 500. 600. 700. 800. 900. 1000. in a battaile, more or lesse at his pleasure, and to cause these battailes to march forwards swiftly or slowly, to sarrie, open, shut, close and disclose their squadrons, some times in sundrie battaillons, reduce themselues vpon a so­daine into one maine square, and from that againe to haue pas­sages &amp; galleries for the shot through diuers places of the same, marching forwards and backward according to the stroke of the drumme, to stay and retyre in perfite measore, with no lesse fa­cilitie then Gentlemen dance their Measures by a noyse of vyo­lens, as hereafter ensueth. When the army can perfitely do this, then cause them sodainly to make any flacke or front, or turne entirely togither, as if it were one bodie without breaking a­ray, for it is a cunning point to make a squadre to march vpon one corner, maintaining his square forme. This and such like varietie in marching, brings the souldier to be verie readie, so that although he neuer saw the enimy in the face, yet he may be rather accounted a trained souldier, then he which hath bene 20, yeares in seruice, and in 20. battailes, if this skil be wanting <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7713"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=91">[Page 170]</a></span> in him, and merites the name of a raw souldier and <span class="hi">Bisognia.</span></p><p>Note that there is no battaile apt to march but only the square battaile or the compound of squares, all others as the <span class="hi">Lunule,</span> the <span class="hi">Triangle,</span> the <span class="hi">Pentagonall</span> and the <span class="hi">Hexagonall,</span> the circular and ouall battailes, and others which easily may be inuented, neuer serue to any vse, but onely in fixed and immoueable bat­tailes, for presently and by and by in marching they disorder. Therefore great consideration is to be had betwixt a marching and standing battaile, which kinde of immoueable battailes, though of themselues they are smally seruiceable, considering that in all encounters continuall motion is required, it being vnpossible to train men to that perfection, but that in marching they shall breake their aray, yet for exercise sake, and for some speciall seruice, it is most conuenient for the Sergeant Maior, oftentimes to plant his souldiers into those fashions of imbat­telling, that appeare hereafter by figures: sodainely changing them from a triangle to a square, and from one shape to another, and thereby bring them into such perfection in these lesse neces­sarie and hard cunning toyes, that the other plaine seruiceable formes may séeme most plaine and easie.</p><p>He must beforehand premeditate, as partly I haue touched, and cast in his minde in what sort with most facilitie he may bring his men to order of battaile, committing to the peculiar Sergeant of euery band, the charge to draw thē forth in sléeues and maniples, and so cause one to march close vp by another till al the battailes be furnished, placing alwaies the Ensignes and drums in the middle rankes of the battaile.</p><p>There néede no such curious order to be vsed in placing the shot in any forme of battaile, but only to put them into certaine wings and flankes for the battailes, and if he thinke good, euery wing to be deuided into sundrie pettie troopes, of 25. 50. or 100. men a péece, and euerie of these troopes to haue a leader, which is either Corporall, Sergeant, or <span class="hi">Cauallier</span> of Saint <span class="hi">Georges</span> squadre: so that to maintaine a skirmish, first one Corporall or leader marcheth forth and bringeth to the face of the enimie his troope, who presently discharging retyre themselues, and in his place another leader with his companie presents himselfe, con­tinuing this order of supply, succouring, seconding, shadow­ing and encreasing the skirmish, continually maintaining the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7756"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=91">[Page 171]</a></span> same without any intermission, either inuading, retyring, or in any charge or enterprise, a requisite obseruation for the for­lorne hope. But the place being large, it shall be requisite to present oftentimes many of these troopes at once to the face of the enimie, who hauing deliuered their volée of shot, may if it be thought good, march about and giue place to those that shall supply their place, &amp; so relieue &amp; succour one another by turnes. And this kind of discharging and supplying, may in the open field be verie well maintained in the ring march, as the rutters do, so that in whéeling about, the head shall be sure alwayes to haue charged before the taile haue discharged: and thus in a circular march the skirmish all day shall continue.</p><p>In plaine ground he shall neuer turne out any shot to the skirmish, without certaine sléeues of pikes to gard them vpon the retraite from the charge of horses, and also troopes of short weapons, as swords and targets, Halberds or such like to backe them, if at any time they should come to the sword, or ioyne pell mell with the enimie, and such were called of the <span class="hi">Ro­maines <span class="hi">vindices,</span></span> but if euery shot had likewise at his backe a light leather or Uenecian target, to vse with his sword when he saw occasion, they would doe great good seruice.

Let al that which he determines and appoints to be done, be commanded and ordained from the backe of the rankes and squadron, and not from the front or from any other place: for in marching more attentiuely, and with lesse occasion of tu­mult and turning, those things be better vnderstood and are more capable which are spoken and proceede from behind the backe, then from the front and flankes, and with greater facili­tie doth runne all along the rankes, and as they say, according to the word <span class="hi">Passa Parola,</span> aduan<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> the word.</p><p>The Sergeant Maior, when his squadrons ariue at any strait passage or bridge, or other narrow or di<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>icile place that might disorder him, must cause them passe ranke by ranke one after another, so that the ranke being a little disseuered or broken, let him frame y<sup>e</sup> ranke a new, &amp; so taking like order in euery rank, he shal immediatly forme behind the strait and bridge in the fa­shion of the first appointed squadron: and in this <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ort may hée procéed with good consideration, with as manie squadrons &amp; bat­tailes as there be.</p><p>When he giues a volée of shot, or makes a <span class="hi">Salua</span> of Musket &amp; Hargabussers, it is much better for him to begin at the head, thē in any other place, that he may in due order ranke by ranke cause one to follow another, euen to the backe and last ranke, so that how much more it yéelds a gallant &amp; readie grace, so much more makes it shew that those souldiers be practised, and argues the sufficiencie of him that guides them.</p><p>When nothing e<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e of importance remains behind to be done, and that the forward and maine battaile hath stood in squadrons to attend and receiue the reregard, le<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> him, the same being ari­ <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ed, disband the battaile, hauing beforehand taken order with the Herbingers of the bands, that euerie one guide the <span class="hi">Al­fierus</span> of his owne companie to his proper quarter.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7857"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=92">[Page 173]</a></span>In disbanding the battaile let him guide the Ensignes into such a place of aduantage in height, as from thence all the squa­dron, consisting of the vantgard, battaile, and Rereward, may with commoditie behold and sée them, to the intent that euery souldier following his proper Ensigne, may go therewith to his lodging and appointed quarter.</p><p>The order which is accustomed to bée obserued in assaulting the enemie, aswell in the day as in the night, I suppose it can­not expresly and particularly from point to point bee declared, considering it must bée conformable to the stratagemes of the Prince or Captain generall that gouernes: But I haue often­times séene them p<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>t in practise, and resolutely wrought with <span class="hi">Incamisados,</span> with assured and secreat rootes, and with imbusca­des placed in a conuenient and apt couert, such as growes to bée of aduantage to them that lies in ambush, who ought to attend the time, to assault silently and secretely, hauing his Sentinels, vedettes, countersignes and voices, such as bée plaine, manifest &amp; able to bée vnderstood, &amp; not double, doubtfull and obscure: The which sometimes with grea<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> error and infinite losse, hath caused one thing to bée taken for an other.

To this end all Collonels must ordaine, that all the drums haue one kind and maner of battery, and that they do vse al one forme of sounding to the field, of sounding y<sup>e</sup> alarme, and to vse one proper sound, to plant themselues in battell, to aduance themselues, to recoyle, to turne in battell themselues from one side to another, to make retraite, and in sum to signifie all other points, that the voice of one person alone cannot make so easily to be vnderstood, as dooth the sound of many drums, the which make themselues to be hard in the greatest tumults and throngs. The souldiors also ought to be so attentiue, to hearken and giue eare to that which is spoken and commanded, that they néed neuer to be deceiued: the drums likewise ought to be ready to batter their caisses according to y<sup>e</sup> sound of the collonels trum­pets, by the which they must altogether direct and gouerne their batteries. The Collonels trumpet ought to be expert in all these sounds, &amp; that he be able to vtter them so plainly, that the drums take not one thing for an other, but that he know how to expres the same according to his Collonels commandement, néere vnto whose person he ought to be euer, &amp; not to abandon him: &amp; to yéeld a reason what mooues me to appoint trumpets for footmen, it is in respect y<sup>t</sup> they may be more cléerly vnderstood then drums can be if any great tumult should arise, &amp; that the drums should alter &amp; change their sound: for they are to be directed by trumpets, the sound wherof is hier thē the battery of drums, the which y<sup>•</sup> Zwi­zers who first inuented drums haue very wel <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ried: therfore let collo<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ls prouide y<sup>t</sup> they haue trūpets before their battaillōs that y<sup>e</sup> Chieftains may signifie &amp; admonish thē what they haue to do. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9199"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=112">[Page 205]</a></span> All these things togither with ech seueral sound, must be taught &amp; shewed from point to point to ech particular band apart, be­fore they be ranged togither in battel, to y<sup>e</sup> intent they may haue the full art to maintaine their order &amp; ranks, without that any place how difficile soeuer, be able to disband or disseuer them. And also that the sound of the trumpet be so familiar vnto them, that they cānot erre, neither take one thing for another, but that the Collonels bands be ech one priuatly &amp; fully instructed in all that which the battaillons ought to do, being assembled with the armie. And for that armes are brought to seuerall kinds of bat­tels, either in respect of the enimies in sight, or for feare of some sodaine assault, ech band ought to be exercised in such sort and so instructed, that they may with great assurance march through y<sup>e</sup> enimies countrie &amp; fight if néed require, the officers instructing &amp; shewing the souldiers, that which they haue to do, if they were assaulted on one side or other at vnawares.</p><p>And that they be taught the order to resist the enimie in a day of battell, or when the enimie doth approch in sight, they ought to learne how a battel must begin, and how one battaillon doth abord another battaillon of the enimies: and to shew them the place where they ought to retyre if they be repulsed: and who must enter into and supply their places: and to what signes, to what sounds, to what voyces they ought to obey: and that which they must do when they heare these voyces and sounds, and sée those tokens &amp; signes: and to accustome them with the sundrie sorts of battels and fained assaults, in such sort, that afterwards they may not onely dare to abide, but also desire the fight in good earnest: the which assurance shal so much the rather encrease, by how much they sée themselues wel instructed, ordered, &amp; ranged, rather then by their proper hardines, chiefly if these battailons be ranged in such sort that they may easily succour one another, which is of no small importance to encourage &amp; assure the soul­diers: For admit that I should be of the first combatants, &amp; that I know into what part I ought to retire my selfe, being ouer­matched, and likewise who he is that must come in my place, I shall alwayes fight with a better heart, beholding my succours néere at hand, rather then if I neither knew them nor saw thē. Likewise if I be in the second place (although the first be repul­sed, &amp; that I behold them to recoile) yet the same shal not astonish <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9226"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=113">[Page 206]</a></span> nor appale me, for that I alredie know what this recoile doth signifie: a thing which beforehand I shal desire to come to passe, to the intent that I may be he that shall gaine the victorie, and that the first do not carrie away the honour of the fielde alone to themselues.</p><p>These exercises therefore be most necessarie both for young and olde souldiers, for it appeares, that although the Ro­maines knew perfitely what were to be accomplished in a parti­cular band, and so consequently in a whole armie, and that they did learne all these things in their youth in <span class="hi">C<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>mpo Martio,</span> yet neuerthelesse they were afterwards continually exercised, as wel in the time of peace, as when their enimies did front them. <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> in his historie saith, that the continuall exercise of the <span class="hi">Romaine</span> armie, did make the common multitude of those that followed the campe, serue in a day of battell as well as the soul­diers: for both the one and the other knew how to kéepe their ranks, and in kéeping them how to fight in them. But an armie of new souldiers, whether they be leuied to serue presently, or that an order be taken to haue them in readines to be imployed in time to come, they will arise to proue vnprofitable without these practises and exercises. Therefore order being so necessa­rie, all Captaines, Collonels, and Sergeant Maiors, must with double industrie and trauell instruct or cause to be instructed, those which be ignorant, and to continue and maintaine the same in those which are perfect, imitating the steps of those ex­cellent Captaines which haue trauelled to maintaine this disci­pline.</p><p>The souldiers therefore in priuate bands being instructed to kéepe their rankes by 3. and 3. fiue and 5. or 8. and 8. without ha­uing respect to the number, euen or odde, for that it is a thing of no importance, but an obseruation brought vp without founda­tion, &amp; specially <span class="hi">Vegetius</span> can yéeld no reason therefore, but on­ly vse. They must then in marching softly or in hast, learne to multiplie, as two ranks of fiue to make 10. &amp; two of 10. to make 20. and by and by at one instant to bring them from the same rankes and to place them in their first and simple order of a­ray.</p><p>And to the end they may assure and accustome themselues <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9271"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=113">[Page 207]</a></span> the better, it is necessarie they make Lymassons when they are in simple and single aray, and to aduertise them that the second person in ranke, doe kéepe alwayes iust behind the first without loosing him, and the 3. right behind the second, and so of the rest.</p><p>This done togither with the directions of my second booke, e<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>h band must apart be set in order, and in the estate that is re­quired and requisite to range them, when a whole battell is planted togither. To performe which the Pikes of the flankes and the Hargabusiers shall come out of aray, and shall place themselues on the one side and the Corporals of the Pikes shall make head, one of the Corporals and his people first, and another of the Corporals and his people next, the Corporall of the Halberdeares shall follow, hauing the <span class="hi">Alfierus</span> with his Ensigne in the middest of the Halberds. Then the other Corporals with their Pikes, shal make the reregard with their people.</p><p>It must be shewed to euerie Corporall the place which he ought to kéepe at all times, who likewise must declare the same plainely and particularly to euerie priuate souldier of his squadre.</p><p>The Captaine must be at the head of the aray, and the Lieu­tenant at the backe, the Sergeant hath no staying place, vn­lesse the Captaine do appoint him one, but must alwayes trot here and there all alongst the rankes, to see good order kept, and to commaunde the performance of his Captaines plea­sure.</p><p>Let continuall vse accustome the souldiers, to know of themselues, how to range themselues in battell: for the bet­ter learning whereof, they must be made to march forward and backward, and to passe difficile places without trou­bling and breaking their aray, the which if they be not able to doe, they are not to be esteemed old souldiers, although they haue serued twentie yeares.</p><p>The difficultie likewise is great, to cause them place them­selues vpon a sodaine in their first aray being broken or dis­persed, by reason of vneasie passages, or that the enimies haue disseuered them, for in this it is requisite to haue had good and great exercise of a long continuance. Therefore <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9307"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=114">[Page 208]</a></span> that the same may be accomplished, it is necessarie to haue two things obserued &amp; maintained, the one that the Ensignes may be easily knowne by colours and figures of number, and that the chiefe members and officers haue certaine cognisances or markes vpon their armes and apparell: and the other is, that one selfe band be ranged alwayes in one certaine and knowne place of the battaillon, without causing the same to alter roomes: and that the Corporals know the places that they must enter into, without shifting at any time, but if that one Corporall be accustomed to be in the formost ranke, that he remaine there al­wayes, and the souldiers in the places which hath ben ordained them from the beginning. And if that any one band hath bene taught to be in the right corner of the battell, that the same doe not stirre from thence, and so consequently that which is vsed to the left shall go to the left. By this meanes if the souldiers be accustomed to know their places (put case they should be out of order) yet should they be able to place themselues againe easily. For the Ensignes do know alredie the place where they are ac­customed to be planted in the battel: and the Corporals know­ing likewise their place, may iudge also by ranke of eye vpon what part it is that they should place themselues: so that those of the front shall steppe forwards to the front, and those of the backe shall in like sort retire to their places.</p><p>Therefore the Corporals knowing in how many and what rankes they haue to arrange themselues, it will follow that the souldiers, not hauing any thing else to do, but to imitate their Leaders and heads, will readily range themselues euerie one in his owne place, without hauing néede of any sergeant of a band, nor any other to place them, prouided that vse and practise hath made them perfect masters. These things are instructed &amp; lear­ned spéedily, so that diligence be vsed, &amp; that mē accustome them­selues by little &amp; little and often, the which after they haue once well learned, they shall hardly forget. It is moreouer necessarie to teach them to turne al at one time, for it is somtimes requisite to make of the rereward the front, or of one of the flankes the rereward, according to the enimies face, and according to the place of assault. Now to answere towards the place néedful, you haue no more to do, but to turne your person towards the place appointed, and so shall that part towards which the souldiers <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9325"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=114">[Page 209]</a></span> haue turned their faces be the front. But he that would haue a whole battaillon turne all in one péece, &amp; as if it were a massie body, in this it were necessarie to haue great practise &amp; discretiō, for to turne it vpon the left hand, it is requisite to haue the left corner stay, &amp; that those which be néere adioyning vnto the same, do aduance themselues so slowly, that those vpon y<sup>e</sup> right corner, be not constrained to run: otherwise al wil be confounded, but this may better be made apparant by experience then words.</p><p>The forlorne hope, &amp; the light armed &amp; armed pikes, are to be ranged in y<sup>e</sup> front, flanks &amp; rereward, according to the proportion of the battell, or as the seruice requires, for these are to execute particular functions, in cōuoyes, forrages, inuasions &amp; such like, when it is not requisite to send great numbers of people. The forlorne hope, the pikemen &amp; hargabusiers, are to begin y<sup>e</sup> battel, to fight amongst the horsemen without kéeping any order: and therfore being lightly armed, their office is to fight without stā ­ding still or firme, &amp; in running &amp; trauersing here &amp; there, whe­ther they pursue the enimies, or be followed of them, in which the pikemen wil do good seruice in backing &amp; sustaining the har­gabusiers, and may be able to make front to these that charge vp­on them, whether they be on horseback or foote, or to follow those that be in flight, &amp; to make entrance &amp; to thrust in amongst the enimies, when they begin to stagger or sway. Therfore al soul­diers, whether they be in maine battel, in flanke, forlorne hope, in the impale or rereward, haue néede to be well exercised, that being disbanded, they may immediatly finde againe their places &amp; rang themselues in the same aray they kept before, wherein it is necessarie that all officers become more vigilant in execution then heretofore, and the souldiers more obedient and expert in performing, then at this day they be. Our age brings forth Captaines more curious of gaine then of conseruing good order, and troupes of officers rather to supplie number then sufficient to instruct: The Ensignes thēselues are more in vse for a gal­lant shew, then for any Militarie direction, whereas the ancient Romaines did vse them for a guid: whereby they knew how to put thēselues in order, for euery one after the Ensigne did stay, knew incontinently y<sup>e</sup> place where they were to plant thēselues, they knew y<sup>t</sup> if the same did remoue or stand stil, y<sup>t</sup> they likewise ought to march or stay. Therfore it is necessary that a camp haue diuers bands, &amp; euery band his Ensigne, wherin figures of num­ber <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9383"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=115">[Page 210]</a></span> are to be portraited, to shew what roome and place the same is of in euery regiment or armie, and so consequently where the same is accustomed to be ranged. And also necessarie Lea­ders and officers, that the campe may haue diuers soules, and so likewise diuers liues: all souldiers then ought to gouerne thēselues according to their Ensignes &amp; according to the sounds the which being ordained &amp; set down according as they ought, do command &amp; gouerne a whole regiment and armie. The which, so that it march in such sort as answeres to the batterie of the drums: they shall easily kéepe their order and aray. And to this end were the Flutes and fiffes found out, and sounds of perfect accord: for euen as men that dance by the measures of Musicke do not erre, so likewise a whole battaillon, which in march obeys the sound of the drum cannot breake aray, and therefore the Ro­maines, when they would change their pace, when they would inflame, appcase, or assure the souldiers they did change sounds, &amp; as the sounds did varie, so likewise vsed they variety of names to them, for they had the <span class="hi">Dorike,</span> and the <span class="hi">Phrigien</span> sound: the one did inflame y<sup>e</sup> hearts of y<sup>e</sup> souldiers, the other did make méek &amp; appease them. They had likewise other kinds of sounds as the <span class="hi">Aeolien, Iasien, Lydien</span> &amp; others, the which did al serue to incite or coole the courage of men, which diuersitie of batteries, the Spa­niards do presently verie well imitate, a thing to be obserued of all good souldiers. An armie that consists of diuers battaillons &amp; two or thrée fronts, when they are constrained to break and are repulsed, must retire one within another into the rankes of the next squadrons, which of purpose are planted more thin, &amp; so the first retyring enters into the 2. and y<sup>e</sup> second into the 3. Note that in the first front of a square vpon y<sup>e</sup> fal of any wounded or slaine souldier, he y<sup>e</sup> is next behind him in rank, &amp; is his follower must enter and step into his roome, and fill vp the void place, that the front of the battel may still be maintained, and so obseruing the retire of the battaillons, and the renuing of their ranks, we may accomplish both the Romain &amp; Gréeke discipline. Those battail­lons which are most necessarie to be had in vse, ought to consist of pikes marching before the Ensigne, behind it and on y<sup>e</sup> flanks, carrying light Uenecian rundels and targets on their backes: and in the midst about the Ensigne the halberdeares must stand, prouided alwayes that the notable personages &amp; good souldiers for seruice be dispersed as well in the flanks &amp; behind as before, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9425"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=115">[Page 211]</a></span> and not to put them all to one brunt in the front, as though they were immortall and not able to be ouercome. By this or­der a battell shall be able to sustaine a charge of horsemen or footmen to repulse them, &amp; after enter into the enimies throng: for experience declares that the pikes are made voide of seruice when the rankes be closed pell mell togither, for then the soul­diers are almost one vpon the bodie &amp; backe of another. Where­fore if the pikemen should haue no other weapons but their pikes and swords, they should remaine naked, which doth moue me to commend the rondell to receiue the blowes: and to fight withall in any presse or throng whatsoeuer. The halberdeares may verie well fight in a presse likewise with their halberds, rather then the pikemen with their pikes: The which halber­deares are expresly appointed for execution: and so consequen­ly to follow the said rondels at the héeles, to frée them from the charge of those that be armed, through the great &amp; heauie blowes which they shall giue with their halberds. But touching the rondels, I would haue them alwayes to thrust with the point of their swords, although it were but at the face, the legges and féete, if the enimie be not disarmed in other parts.</p><p>The ground that euery souldier doth occupie at large in mar­ching in simple and single aray, is thrée pace, and being in bat­tell two, and when they fight one. The distance of one ranke from another, in simple and single ordinance and aray, is foure, and being ranged in battell two, and in fight one.</p><p>The first sound of the Collonels trumpet is to enter into the ranke and march, the second to alter the single aray into forme of battell, and the thirde is to aduance and plant the bat­tell. The Collonel being in such a place as from thence he may sée his whole Regiment, hauing the <span class="hi">Caualliers</span> of his squadre of S. <span class="hi">George</span> about him, being such expert souldiers as I haue set downe in my second booke of directions, togither with the Sergeant Maior and such as can execute any commission of im­portance, his drum and trumpet maior about him to sound and cause his pleasure to be sodainly and spéedily vnderstood. The Collonel must commande the sound to be made of his trumpet, which is appointed for the ordinarie march, and soone after to sounde that which is to trot, and then at the selfe time that which commands and appoints the fight and combat.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9458"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=116">[Page 212]</a></span>When a battell doth consist of diuers battaillons, he must not forget to exercise y<sup>e</sup> first to retire within y<sup>e</sup> battaillons of the second, &amp; the second to retire within the battaillons of the third. And to accomplish the same without breaking or disordering the squadrons. The pikes in the flankes must retire as the battail­lons retire, the first into the second, the 3. within the 4. the fourth within the 5. the fift into the 6. of the ranks, and so consequently to the end. The forlorne hope and horsmen shal likewise do their dutie. These things done, the retrait must sound, and euery En­signe must recoile his people apart, to put them again in a new and single ordinance of aray for the march.</p><p>The enimie aduancing to fight in triangular battel with the point forward, frame the battell of sheares to receiue, enuiron and fight with the said pointed battaillon. If the enimie march with a front stretched out in length, make a triangle or pointed battel to pearce the same. The baggage of an armie ought either to be in a place strong by nature, or well defended by art and in­dustrie, togither with the followers of the campe, pages and mu­chachos, who must be chosen able to fight in a day of seruice, for the defence of themselues and their masters baggage.</p><p>The spaces, interualles, galeries and passages, which are a­mongst the ranks, amongst the bands, and amongst the battail­lons, do serue not onely to receiue one another, either in retire, or when the first ranke doth retire through the midst of the se­cond, and the 2. 3. 4. and 5. &amp;c. following him like a Laborinthus mase, going forward to the last ranks and turning backe again, or that his next follower steps a side and lets him passe and en­ter into ranke againe, but also those spaces betwixt the battail­lons serue the <span class="hi">Caualliers</span> &amp; such like that come &amp; go, which car­rie &amp; bring directions of y<sup>e</sup> Chieftaines, Collonels or Generals.</p><p>The forlorne hope and extraordinarie pikes must inuade the enimie with continuall &amp; great cries, the battaillons or maine battell likewise at the first must giue a chearefull shout, when encounter is giuen in the beginning and ioyning of the battels, but afterward maintain a solemne silence, y<sup>t</sup> they may y<sup>e</sup> better vnderstand what commandements and directions procéeds from their chieftain, either for y<sup>e</sup> altering of order or otherwise, which cannot be heard or vnderstood, if they continue a barbarous crie. Squadrons &amp; battaillons must sometimes assault in great hast, chiefly if the enimies artillery doe endomage them verie much, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9508"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=116">[Page 213]</a></span> and sometimes must abide the charge without remoouing, when the place is vneasie, &amp; that they shall be in danger to dismember, specially if they be such as be not accustomed to the march &amp; ma­ner of battels. Therefore in conclusion, these 4 things ought to be obserued of all armies: first that all soldiors &amp; priuate bands be exercised a part in all things belonging to the wars: second­ly, that they know how to range themselues in battell, how to varie, exercise, and march in the same, softly, apace, and in full course, kéeping their araic. Thirdly to learne that which apper­taines to the exercise which they must accomplish in a day of battell, and how to drawe forward and retire the artillarie, to giue way and cause the Hargabuziers to issue out of the flanks, hauing shot sixe or 7 Hargabusades a péece in running héere and there, and without kéeping order, so that they know how to ioyne and agrée with the pikemen and horsemen, to whom the care ouer their safety belongs. They shall retire by the flankes and by the interuals and passages, each one into his place: that is to say, the hargabuziers of the flankes into the flanks, the for­lorne hope to the reregard, there to range themselues according to the Collonels appointment, &amp; as the day of seruice requires, for if they should remaine and continue before the squadre or battel, they shall hinder the maine battaillons in their fight, and bring confusion. The light armed pikes &amp; horsemen must like­wise retire to their places vpon the ioyning of the battels. The fourth exercise is, as partly I haue touched before, that euery one apply himselfe to vnderstand the commaundement of the Chéeftains, the signification of the sounds and trumpets, and the batterie of the drums: by which be signified all that which is generally to be vnderstood: that is to say, when it shall be time to plant themselues in battell, when they ought to march, when to stay or go forward, when to turne visage to one part or other, to crosse the ground, sarrie close, &amp; fight.

It should be good to vse a Cornet or a hunts mans horne, for the retraite, &amp;c. and a trumpet to begin the battell, or contrariwise: for it is a most difficile thing, that the trumpetor should signifie so many diuers things with one instrument, considering that the sound of a re­traite, dooth approch very néere vnto the sounding to the stan­dard, in such sort that then when as all men be troubled, and as it were besides themselues, they shall very hardly be able to discerne whether of these two things the trumpet sounds.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3_div.23"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.3.23. </span><span class="head">What the Sergeant Maior is to obserue touching the length of Pikes.</span></h4><p>A Pike ought neuer to want in length any thing of fiftéene foot, for this respect, when the footemen are streightned and setled in order of battell, they may for the aduantage and profite of the said armie, in respect that the assaults of the enemie is to giue to the said battell, couching &amp; bending their pikes against them, worke so that the greatest number of rankes that is possi­ble for the defence of the battell, may endamage and offend the said enemies, and therefore their pikes being shorter then fif­téene foote, it prooues that no more of the ranks can fight, but the first, second and third, standing all in order in their places, and yet can the third ranke fight but discommodiously, &amp; not aduance forward his pike to succor and defend the first ranke, forsomuch as the distance of the ground, from one ranke to another, in any battell, how straight and close soeuer it be, would be neuerthe­lesse so much, that men may manage and handle their weapons and sturre themselues, without being a hinderance or trouble one to another.

Note that it is to be vnderstood of a pikeman, I will first aduertise all Sergeant Maiors, and all good Captaines and Sergeants, and others, that delight in profession of battels, that there be two reasons, wherefore the vnderstanding of these distances, be of importance: the one is to know how much ground is necessary to manage a battell, &amp; how much space the circumference of the battell will take round a­bout it, according to the quantitie of the souldiours, that are to be in the said battel. And the other is, that it is néedful to know, how much space is limited to a souldior from shoulder to shoul­der, and from one ranke to another. And this proportion hath bin found out and limited, of great practised and cunning men, to the intent that the said distance from one ranke to another, may in a certaine space of time be accomodated, that the souldiours may comodiously manage their pikes, may fight, and in such sort that one ranke of souldiours may succour an other that stand be­fore them, and deale in such sort that all the battell may worke good effect, forasmuch as when they do accommodate themselues ouerstraite and narrowe, they can neither fight nor yet hardlye mooue themselues. And the same inconuenience would chance, if souldiors were placed in battell one ouer farre from another, or one ranke too much distant from an other. Therefore it is a most conuenient thing, to vse in this case those limited rules, that the auncient and moderne souldiours haue set downe, and such as our Captaines haue obserued. The space therefore of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9630"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=119">[Page 218]</a></span> grounde, that one Souldiour with his necessaries dooth holde from shoulder to shoulder shall be of thrée foote, and nothing lesse, in such sort, that when any battell is to bee made, let vs put this example, that if there be a ranke of 25 souldiours in a battell, it is néedfull to imagine, that the length of the said 25. footemen shall containe the space of 75. foote, which is fiftéene pace.</p><p>Speaking of the <span class="hi">Venetian</span> pace, which is fiue foote for the pace, whereof I meane alwaies to speake. The space moreouer of the ground that is to be obserued for the ouerthwart of a bat­tell, that is, from one ranke to another, that they may be able to manage themselues with their pikes aswell in marching as in fighting in maine battell, no lesse then seauen foote is obserued from one ranke to another. Moreouer to the intent he may more commodiously march with his pike on his shoulder, the ground would be no lesse then of ten foote, which is two pace, but after when they are to close and ioyne more straite, as I haue said before, of 7. foote: in such sort, that a man in ranke with his space before him, will amount to held vnto the other ranke, ten foote, which is two pace, accounting thrée foote of ground which he holds with his person, and the other 7 foote, the space vnto the other ranke, make 10 foote. Let vs then presuppose this figure or example: That he is to make a battell that is a perfect square of twentie euery way, we must count how much ground the said battell will take in circuite, and sée if the same be capable of the number of Souldiours, which are appointed to be put and set in battell.</p><p>Our rule therefore shall holde vpon two fides, that is, vpon the fronte and the backe, and taile of the battell, where the Souldiours stand shoulder to shoulder, in 60. foote, which is 12. pace, for both sides and both the foresaid sides be 24. pace. The other two sides which be the flankes of the said battell, where the space is left betwixt one ranke and an other of seauen foote, and therefore the person of the souldier which is séene one with an other, in such sorte that the battell which is to be made of 20 Souldiours for euery side, a perfect square of people, but not a perfect square of ground: forasmuch as two sides will be 12. pace on a side, which in both comes to 24. pace: the other two will be for euery side 40. pace, which is 80 pace, and so hauing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9641"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=119">[Page 219]</a></span> ioyned vnto the same 24. pace, it will bee round about the said battell of 20 Souldiours on a side 104. pace, which is 520. foote of circumference of ground, and so alwaies this order is to be ob­serued, not that you are to take a corde or a rod, or pace, to mea­sure the distance of the said battell, but by racke of eye by your witte and discretion consider this measure, for whether it be more or lesse, it little imports. It dooth suffice that you obserue a certaine discretion, that may come to the marke I haue written, if it doe not light iust at leastwise néere the bounds and mea­sure I haue set downe. Now since we haue put this figure and example of a perfect square battel of people, but not of ground for 20. souldiers, we wil speak of an other forme or figure, some­what differing or disagréeing from such like battels, and yet for all that of the same number of twentie Souldiours, for euery side in perfect square, the which is square of people &amp; of ground, as some doe vse to make, as may appeare in a battell of 400. Souldiours, square in ground and people: the which being in this forme, hath for space of ground about in circumference 800. foote, which is 160. pace. This is sufficient to remember you of the manner that is obserued in the distance and measure in the circumference of the battell.</p><p>And now returning to my discourse of one ranke from an­other, when the Souldiours are ioined &amp; closed in battell with their pikes, &amp; when they stand in terme to fight, to me it séemes, that then in that accident, the battell is to close and ioyne as straight together as is possible, in such sort as they may manage and bestir themselues with their weapons, without being an impediment one to another, to the intent that the rankes being straite in fighting, or that the souldiors be inuaded by their ene­mies, or that they recoile by force of an onset, they néed not to fal to the ground, but rather that they may by those ranks that bee behinde their backes receiue helpe, that vndersetting them with their brests, they may hold them straight vp vpon their féete. And this is not onely my opinion, but of diuers other mos<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> excellent wits.</p><p>The other rule of the distance of seauen foote from ranke to <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>anke, which we haue spoken of, is meant of marching and the managing and exercising of a battell, to the intent <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9667"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=120">[Page 220]</a></span> the soldiors may receiue exercise &amp; discipline in the said battell, in the which alwaies the foresaid order of measure &amp; distance is to be obserued, to the intent that the Sergeant &amp; the other heads which do gouerne them, may the more comodiously manage and enter in and out through the space of the said ranks.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3_div.27"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.3.27. </span><span class="head">How battels of euery number of footmen are compoun­ded and placed together in order.</span></h4><p>MAny &amp; sundry be the waies which be obserued in compoun­ding together the battels of footmē, but I verely thinke that the most expedient &amp; short way amongst practised soldiors is in these two sorts: that is the one to ioyne together the battel with diuided maniples, and the other to double the ranks of the aray. The sergeant Maior, Captaine, or other Sergeant, hauing first determined in his minde of how many men in a ranke he will make his battell, knowing first the number of the pikes that are to be had: so making of one company, as he may do of many one onely battell: &amp; procéeding to make the battell in which of the <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> waies he list, either by parting it into maniples, or by doubling the ranks. It is therefore first requisite, to set the footmen in a­ray that are to be found there present, numbring all the pikes, and accomodating the araye in such sort that the battell may afterwards be made withall spéed, and that it may serue the turne, for either of those two waies, as I haue said. It is neces­sarie therefore to know the place where the battell is to be set, and to take care that there be so much space as may be capable thereof, knowing the rules of distance, which is vsed in warfare that is, how much ground the Souldiours hold from shoulder to shoulder, and how much distance is left betwixt ranke and ranke of pikes. But touching the measure I néed to speake no more, for that the officer may measure the ground by pases: yet I would commend a Souldiour that is of such discretion, that of himselfe can accomodate those things by racke of eye, without such precise trouble in measuring the grounde. And if a battell require 300. paces in circumference, hee by racke of his eye maye sée whether the place bee capable or no, noting that the rules to put the distance of ranckes, is made for this other respect, which is of much more importance, that the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9690"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=120">[Page 221]</a></span> rankes of the battell may fight without any impediment of the Souldiers, foreséeing that euerie third ranke may succour the first with their pikes: and speaking of battels you must euer thinke that I speake of pikes, for battels are neuer made of hargabusiers: it is verie true that hauing made the battels of pikes, you may accommodate them afterwards as you list about the battels, by the flankes in y<sup>e</sup> corners &amp; hornes, or betwixt one pike and another of the formost rankes of the battell, or in such other sundry wayes as may best aid and helpe the battell: let i<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> suffice that of Hargabusiers there is neuer any certaine rule set downe, but euer is to be vnderstood of the order of pikes in bat­tell: of the which two wayes, where I speake how a battell must be made wel and spéedily, I will endeuour my selfe to let you vnderstand the way the best I can. Desiring therefore to worke by the first way I haue spoken of: that is, to make any battell by maniples, if it be to be made of any one company a­lone, let it be of what number soeuer of footmen, it is first requi­site to set the aray with intent to diuide it into thrée parts, that is to say, into 3. maniples, which may be iust of as many rankes one as another, in the which maniples, you ought by numbring the rankes of the pikes, cause the Ensignes of the said aray to kéepe one ranke like vnto the pikes, and this is obserued when the thrée maniples be vneuen: that is to say, that two of them should chance to be of 20. ranks, and the 3. of 19. or 18. rankes, and then the Ensignes shalbe numbred for one ranke: but alwayes the other two maniples are to be of iust number, as for example. There is a company of 300. pikes, the which if you desire to put in aray before you make your battell, consider how many ranks they will be 5. in a rank, and you shal finde them to be 60. ranks: diuide the aray into 3. parts, cutting them off at euery 20. ranks, and after draw vp to the first ranke the second part, that is, the maniple of the middest, and ioyne in order the first ranke to the head of the first maniple, the which being on the right hand of the maniple with the Ensignes, you shal draw then the 3. maniple to the left side, ioyning the first rankes to the head of the other two maniples: so that the aray hauing bene of fiue for a ranke, the battel shalbe one way 15. and the other way of 20. pikes. Now desiring to haue the battell to be more large in the front, then in the flankes, the which I commend, of what number soeuer the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9706"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=121">[Page 222]</a></span> pikes are of, he shall cause y<sup>e</sup> Sergeant to go to y<sup>•</sup> flank where he would make the front, and standing still a little distance forth of the battel, he shal crie aloud, <span class="hi">Turne your faces this way,</span> the which being heard of the souldiers, sodainly they shall turne them selues towards that side which he shall giue them notice of. Ob­serue then this order at all times: when you haue made a bat­tell, let the pikes be of what number soeuer, let it suffice y<sup>t</sup> I ad­uertise you, y<sup>t</sup> at al times when you list to make the front where the flanke is, so that the place where you would make it be cap­able and commodious, that you may frame and make the battell according to your determination, you must cause them to turne their faces towards that side where you would haue the front of the battell to be. I iudge it good likewise to aduertise you, that desiring to make any battell with maniples, for that it often­times fals out, that some rankes in the aray do remaine vnper­fite, which are called broken rankes: these are taken out &amp; are accommodated about at the sides of the Ensignes, so diuided ne­uerthelesse that they may remaine in good order. The which Ensignes, alwayes when you make any battell, you must haue respect that they may haue a large roome and space, that they may accommodate themselues with the souldiers, which make the broken number, as for example in aray of fiue and fiue in a ranke, in the last ranks there remaines 3. or 4. souldiers, which do not furnish out the full ranke. And the like is to be obserued when you are to part your aray into 3. maniples, and that they haue some rankes more then the entire and full aray. As would fall out hauing to make an aray of 500. pikes, and put the case that you would place them 7. and 7. in a ranke, they would fall out to be 71. rankes, and 3. pikes more: and diuiding into thrée parts these 71. pikes and 3. pikes, they amount to 23. rankes, dou­bling the 3. maniples, as I haue said, so that 3. times 23. makes 69. rankes, and there is ouer and besides two rankes of the aray and 3. pikes, which is in all the brokē number 17. pikes, which in making of y<sup>e</sup> battell, must be set aside by themselues, vntil the 3. maniples be ioyned in battell, the which on one side will be 23. pikes, &amp; on the other 21. The 17. pikes then that are taken out, shal be accommodated, diuided here &amp; there where the Ensignes stand. And when it fals out that there doth arise to be pikes or broken rankes, that are so many as were able to make a whole <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9747"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=121">[Page 223]</a></span> ranke in the battel, then it is to be made, ioyning it either before or behind the Ensignes, or at the flankes of the battell, or where it shal fal out to be best, for it imports not much: and so you work by this rule of maniples, in one companie alone as well as with many. And hauing to make a battell of sundrie companies, the true rule is to work by these maniples, and you must procéed in this sort. First take order with all the heads of the companies, that they frame all their order of aray in one manner and sort, &amp; if any of the said heads haue any greater number of pikes then his commission doth allow, let him take them forth &amp; giue them in supplie to those Captaines that are found to haue lesse then he hath appointed for their aray. Let vs then vse this example in this sort, that is, that if there be found in companie or in any other place, vnder the gouernmēt of ten Captaines, to the num­ber of 3. thousand souldiers in aray, that is to say, only pikes, af­ter the rate of thrée hundred vnder euerie Captaine, being iust 3000. of which the Sergeant Maior hauing to make a battaillon must do in this sort. He must giue order to all the Sergeants of the bands, that they make all their araies after one sort, &amp; after one number, and the one head or front being distant from the other a little, he shall cause their arayes to march, and let vs put the case that the Sergeant Maior haue giuen them order, that they place themselues sixe and sixe, there will be in euerie com­panie 50. rankes, and so it is néedfull that euerie one haue put their aray 6. and 6. in 50. rankes, and desiring to ioyne and close these battels, he shal cause these companies to march one after an other, &amp; shall close them togither, ioyning the first rankes to the head of the aray one of another, knitting the maniples to their portion: and this battell will fall out to be on one side 50. pikes, which wil be flanks, and the other which wil be the front, wil be of 60. pikes, for so much as being 10. maniples, 6. in a rank, it wil fal out to be iust, as I haue said before: to make it a right square, it wil be of 54. on euery side remaining out of y<sup>e</sup> battel 84, which at pleasure may be put in ranke, &amp; so taking 54. out of 84, there remaines 30. pikes, which being not able to make a ranke, are to be placed about the Ensignes, as I haue said before.</p><p>There be othersome, that hold this other manner in making of battels, to double the ranks, that is, hauing set his araie, and marching with them, they begin at the head of the aray, where <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9764"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=122">[Page 224]</a></span> the Sergeant staying, doth cause them to march forward, and the first beginning to passe, doth appoint the second that it ioyne it selfe with the first, and so the third with the fourth. And fi­nally the ray going forward, doth cause the rankes to double two by two: so that if first the ranke were 9. and 9. they arise to be 18. in a ranke. And desiring to make them more large, he may put 3. rankes in one, which will be 27. in a ranke, and so he may double them to what number he wil, and of as many ranks as he will, but it is requisite before he make his aray, to consider well how many pikes he hath, and afterward accommodating his aray to his appointed number, that by doubling it by two or thrée rankes, it may become as square as is possible, neither is he to do it without this consideration, for otherwise working by haphazard, it fals out to be euill fauoured, to be by halfe more long then large, and sometimes double: But it is first necessarie for him to number the rankes of the aray, and consider if dou­bling two rankes at a time, it will fall out to be well, or better to double it thrée at a time. And this must be well considered, for otherwise he shall make and vnmake to his great disgrace. Therefore now I conclude, that the first way is euer best &amp; most readie without toile or trouble in doubling and redoubling: So that helping your memorie with certain <span class="hi">Tablei</span> or <span class="hi">Tariffas</span> made of purpose to know the numbers of the souldiers that are to en­ter into ranke, and what number of rankes will performe the iust square, you can neuer erre, but vpon any sodaine, set in bat­tell any number of souldiers whatsoeuer.</p></div></div><div class="book" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9782"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=122">[Page 225]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4. </span><span class="head">THE FOVRTH BOOK OF MILITARIE DIRECTIONS, ENTREATING OF THE OFFICES AP­pertaining to the Generall of Horsemen, the Scout master, and the office of the Marshall of the Field.</span><br /><span class="head">And first of the office of the Lieutenat or Generall of the Horsmen.</span></h3><p><span class="decorInit">T</span>He Maine squares of all sorts of battels receiue great safetie &amp; accomplish worthy seruice by the companies of the couragious <span class="hi">Cauallarie,</span> chie<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ie when their bands be guided by those that be of perfite experience and of approued practise in armes, whereas the contrarie effect doth follow, being directed by light heads, and such as onely make profession, but of cleane and gallant riding, or to run in comly order with a Lance vp­on the euen grauell &amp; sand.

When the high marshal goeth to view the ground to encampe vpon, it is this Lieutenants dutie to select a conuenient band to attend vpon his person, and to appoint such a company as may afterward take their rest, and féede their horses til such time as he shal deliuer them to the scout master at night, who then shal enioyne them what to do all the night after, &amp; shal also deliuer them the watchword.

Then shal these horsemen rest &amp; not watch, neither that night, nor go forth for vauntcourrier al the next day.

The sides of these massie squadrons should haue one rank of Argolateares, a pretie distance off. In this sort if one squa­dron happen to be broken, yet shal another make head vpon the enimie, while they may retyre &amp; troupe againe, which is the on­ly safetie as wel of Horsemen as footmen: And albeit in the day of seruice it is the part of the high marshall himselfe, to giue or­der in what sort, and with what troupes the charges shalbe gi­uen or receiued: it is also the Lieutenants part as well to giue his aduise, as also to be a leader in all these actions.</p><p>He ought therefore to take great regard to the ground where he meaneth to giue the charge, for if he charge in troupe, the fal­ling of a few horse in the for most rankes may disorder and foile the whole troupe. Before the front of his owne footmen let him neuer giue charge, for it hath bin séene that horsemen being re­pulsed, haue bene foreed in vpon their own footmen, &amp; disordered them. Let the horse therefore charge vpon the flanke of the eni­mie, and diligently attend if by any accident they can perceiue any breaking or opening in the side of his enimies battell, and then sodainly to charge that breach: for as horsemen are inferi­ours to wel ordered footmen, so vpon any smal disorder, they car­rie with them victory. And for that in our age there hath arisen diuers &amp; fodaine effects not looked for, wrought by the good and well guiding of horsemen, I thinke it good somewhat more am­plie to delate vpon this point: specially, as I said before, in ap­pointing out a place, apart from the battel &amp; ranks, wherin the <span class="hi">Cauallarie</span> may be ranged: to y<sup>e</sup> intent they may with good scope fréely and fitly turne and run with their squadrons and ranks in charging the enimy, in taking charge likewise of them, and in all other enterprises, considering that the troopes of horsemen in retyring or turning round, do often disorder and break their own infanterie, either through the discommoditie of the place, or through the want of the good and warie guiding of them.</p><p>Contrariwise at other times, by their aduised and spéedie ser­ <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>, a small number of horsemen, well bent and better guided, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9965"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=124">[Page 229]</a></span> haue bêene séene to enter very couragiously into a great battaite of the enimies footemen, and either for that they were slenderly flanked with Hargabuziers, or by the disaduantage of the groūd, or being disordered by meanes of some errour, or through some other sinister chance, or by meanes the said battaile was guided by vnequall or vncertaine pase, or through the naughtie indeuor and diligence of rawe and vnpractised souldiers, or in going through a streight place or passage of water or otherwise, horse­men haue easilie disordered and broken their battailes, and all the rest of a whole armie. But yet are they not able to encoun­ter with a well ordered &amp; square battell of pikes, if their coura­gious and well ranged rankes keepe their araie, and when the horsemen charge doe clinge and sarrie verie néere together in the fore rancke, and set shoulder to shoulder with their pikes well couched and crossed, bending them in both their handes straight before them, and their followers at their backes, laying theyr pikes ouer their foregoers shouldiers, and so stand at the push, besides the shouldering of the foreranks together, hauing pitched their pikes vnder one of their feete in the ground, they stoope and bow downe so loe with their bodies, that their fol­lowers may easilie come to seruice behinde their backes, where some doe vse to place the light armed pikes, who amongst some nations for want of brest plates of Iron, vse tand lether, paper, platecoates, iackets, &amp;c. For a gorget, thicke folded kerchefes a­bout their neck, a scull of Iron for a head péece, and a Uenetian or lether Shéeld and Target at their backes, to vse with their short Swordes at the close of a battaile, and in a throng. The squadron of pikemen, hauing couched and crossed their pikes brest high, closely sarred together, are as hard to be pearst with horsemen, as an angrie Porcapine or Hedgehog with the end of a bare finger. Wherefore to ouerthrowe a maine square battaile planted in that order, it is good to vse the aide of Hargolateares, who must first scale the fronte and ranks of the battels, and then being seconded by the lances &amp; men at armes, breake their araie and whole battaile. In the erecution whereof it is good to vse the Rutters order, which somewhat differs from the French mans fight, for he encountring the enemie cannot indure any troope to be néere his long stretched ranckes, because of breaking his course; but the retire fighteth in this sort.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9983"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=125">[Page 230]</a></span>When the retire is approched néere enough vnto the enemie, the first ranke dooth aduance vpon them, and when he hath dis­charged his Pistolet, he doth run still in forward (as dooth the French, who doth still pursue his point) but more short on the right hand or on the left, according vnto the place where he is, and so is also spéedely followed by the second ranke which dooth the same. Then the third followeth the second, to giue the charge as soone as euer he séeth him departed that stood before him: all the rankes following one another in such maner, euen vnto the last, the hindermost runneth, (they fighting with Pistolets one­ly) for to come vnto their foreriders, they standing all along one at anothers backe. And for so much as it is impossible, but that when they do present themselues, some of them or else their hor­ses be slaine: Therefore so soone as euer one of the formost ranke is séene to fall downe, he that is in the second ranke, directly be­hinde him that is departed, or else disabled, must take his place, and the next behind him in the third ranke, must furnish the same voide ranke wherein he was in the second, and so the rest in like order, so that they alwaies make their formost rankes of the most assured: for in all things, namely in <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>eates of armes) the beginning is of greatest moment: some to break the front of armed pikes do vse to cause the men at armes dismount, and in their complet armor, to charge them with their launces.</p><p>Some others hold an opinion, that the maner of the Germans is best, who kéepe alwaies their maine troopes standing, &amp; cause only one ranke from the front to charge, &amp; the same being repul­sed, to retire to the taile and backe of the standing troope, &amp; then an other to charge and retire to the taile &amp; backe, as the former, whereby they maintaine the whole troope in full strength, vntil they sée the footmen sway or breake, &amp; that their horsemen enter. Then presently they back them with an other ranke, &amp; those a­gaine with an other, vntill they sée cause either to follow with the whole troope, or to staie: &amp; this is thought to be the surest and most orderly forme of charging of all others: notwithstanding the accustomed whéeling about of the rutters, which they vse with their whole troopes, euery one after an other, giuing the e­nemie a volée of their Pistolets.</p><p>For execution of iustice on such as are offendors in any bands of horsmen: albeit in some countrie it be vsed, that euery Cap­taine <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10011"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=125">[Page 231]</a></span> of an hundred men at armes, may call vnto him certaine of the chéefe of his band, and heare and determine all causes and offences by any of his bande committed, yet surelye I holde it more conuenient, that all matters concerning life be harde by the Lord high marshall, who may cause to sit with him the said Captaine, whose souldior is to be adiudged, and such other of the said band as to him shall séeme méete, and the souldiour condem­ned to death, to be executed by the said band, euen as the footmen are: and by the same kind of weapons that the offendors vsed.

This officer in the auncient Romaine warres was neuer in vse, for they would neuer admit any watch without the trenches of their campe, but obserued this order, that euery night one third part of the armie remained armed, the other two thirds tooke their rest: and this armed part they deuided into 4 quarters, and appointed to eue­rie watch of the night one quarter, which went and walked con­tinually about the trenches of the Campe, to heare and sée if they could discerne any noise or stirring néere the Campe: the other thrée quarters resting in the meane time returned to the place of assemblie. And when the first watch of the night was ended, then departed an other quarter to the reléefe of the watch, and the quarter that had watched returned to the place of assem­blie. And thus they continued reléeuing the watch vntill day: so that the enemie could neuer approch their campe, but they found one third part in armes, who were able to kéepe them play, vntil the rest had put themselues in order. But after that Militarie discipline grew to corruption, &amp; that souldiors neglecting honor and securitie, would no longer abide the hardnesse and the seue­ritie of the auncient discipline, they inuented this kind of forren scoute, that the paines of a few might leaue the rest at ease. But what mischiefe hath and may thereby ensue, histories will shew vs, and common reason may soone teach vs. Therefore in time of danger and suspect of the enemie, I would notwithstanding the forren scoutes and left sentinels, vse this Romaine diuision and strong order of watch.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.2"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.4.2. </span><span class="head">The office of the high Marshall of the field, or maister of the Campe.</span></h4><p>SUndry famous writers affirme, that a Prince dooth no lesse execute his kingly authoritie &amp; dignitie, when with a sincéere iudgement and equall ballance, he dooth chastise offendors, and oppresse malefactors: then when by good gouerment and cle­mencie herewardes the meritorious, and exalts and raiseth vp <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10149"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=127">[Page 235]</a></span> those that be good.

These connoyes, safgards &amp; Ascoltes ought to be of horse­men, and guided by a Captaine of great discretion &amp; experience.</p><p>When the armie shall remoue, the high marshall must first giue order to the master of the Ordinance, that he set forth the Artillerie, with all the carriages, munition, &amp;c. then the master of the victuals and cariages afterwards.</p><p>He must after giue order to the Sergeant Maior, in what sort he will haue the battell to march that day: and to the scout­master which way he will send his vauntcurrours to discouer if all be cleare, who must from time to time giue intelligence what occurrence he discouereth. The high Marshall when he goeth to view the ground where he intendeth to incampe, may by his authoritie take such number of horsmen, as he shal think conuenient, and then is he to consider that there be nigh at hand, as I said before, wood, water, and forrage enough for the Army: and if he intend long to lodge in that place, then must he make his campe the larger, and prouidently consider, that euery Regi­ment haue his conuenient place, that the tents and cabbins be not pitched and made nigh the ring of the campe: that there bée large places of assemblie within the campe: that it be well in­trenched and fortified, for which respectes it is requisite that the Martial haue knowledge in Geometrie &amp; Arithmetike, and that he haue in a readinesse sundrie plats, models &amp; formes, as partly I haue annexed hereunto, whereby he may be able to resolue for any number or situation, what forme or quantitie of Campe is most conuenient, and presently stake it out, assigning <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ue place for euery Regiment of footmē &amp; horsmen, carriages, Ordinance, Munition &amp; euery particularitie, as hereafter shal more plainly be declared. For lodging of footmen, especially in a running campe, I haue partly in this chapter touched, but for lodging of horsemen it is not amisse to imitate the Rutters, who common­ly alwayes lodge in such closes as they finde enuironed with trées or quicke set hedges and ditches, placing their horses in due order round about the fielde, two paces one from another, with railes betwéene them, leauing al the void ground in the middle for the Captaines tents &amp; cabbines for the horsemen. So that in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10450"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=131">[Page 242]</a></span> that sort in a field of two or thrée acres, I haue séene a guydon of Rutters very well lodged &amp; commodiously, with railes or poles betwéene their horses, and bowes about them for the winde or heat, some with hales ouer them to kéepe them from the raine: their saddels, bridels, and al other their furniture, hanging vpon poles readie by them, neatly kept &amp; blacked, their mangers also before them: for all such necessaries the Ruiters carrie with thē in their wagons and carriages, besides little whéele barrowes to carrie away their doung, so that their campe is no lesse cleane &amp; orderly, then a princes stable. A faire stréete they alwayes leaue betwéene their owne cabbines &amp; their horses: They haue certain troopes of their seruants, whom they cal their knights, and these troupes alwayes attend, that so soone as the Marshall hath limi­ted their quarters, they depart immediatly to the next woods, for poles, bowes, stakes and other necessaries to build their campe, stables, and cabbines: other go for forrage, that before the army approch, the lodgings alwayes are in a readines. To euerie 12. Ruiters commonly there is allowed a wagon with 4 horses, or to sixe a cart with two horses, and their knights are about one third part of the number of their horsemen. The Lance knights also encampe alwayes in the field verie strongly, two or thrée to a cabinet, their pikes &amp; armour standing vp by them in a redi­nes, &amp; so orderly placed with stréets, so conuenient &amp; cleanly pre­serued, that their campe is no lesse holesome then strong: I haue séene sixe thousand of them lodge in sixe or seuen acre of ground, which proportion differeth not much from that of the old Ro­mains.</p><p>The high Marshall, as well for the ordering of sconts, as all other matters of importance in the campe, is to giue order, and at the setting of the watch his trumpets ought first to sound, and then all the residue of the trumpets in order to answere euerie one to his seueral quarter, and in the morning al the trumpets should assemble before the Lord Lieutenants tent, and there to sound the reliefe of the watch, but no man must vpon paine of death remoue from his charge, vntill the warders be come out, then may euerie man depart to his rest.</p><p>In the fielde at a day of seruice, though there be a Generall of the horsemen, yet is it the place of the high Marshall to serue there as chiefe, &amp; to appoint in how manie troopes the horsemen <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10469"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=131">[Page 243]</a></span> shall diuide themselues, and which shall charge, &amp; which stand for their rescue, and to prohibite, that vpon euerie crie amongst the footemen, of march <span class="hi">Cauallarie,</span> or forward horsemen, they do<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> not remoue, disband or giue charge, but onely by knowne coun­ter signes and watch words from the Generall, that inuasions may be made at due times and when necessitie requires, &amp; not for euerie trifle or priuate danger of some persons, for otherwise their disbanding out of time may arise to be ruine and losse of an armie in a day of battell.</p><p>If any prisoners be taken in the fielde, they ought forthwith to be enrold in the Marshals booke, and then if any make claime to any other mans prisoner, the Marshal as iudge to determine who shall haue him, and for euerie prisoner brought into the Marshall sea and enrolled in the Marshals booke, his fée is eight pence: he is also to haue of al booties taken in the field &amp; brought into the campe the third part: but as well for this as other his fées, they are by the General to be limited at the beginning, as shall be thought reasonable. Finally the high Marshal ought to be a man of such perfection, that he know the duetie of euerie inferiour officer, and be able to reforme their misdéeds, and that of his owne knowledge. The handling of small matters must be committed to his Prouost, who ought to be a chosen person, alwayes retaining the greater causes, and such as concerne life to be heard by himselfe, who for his greater reputation, and to be knowne from other officers, he should haue a Cornet or gui­don borne before him in the fielde, as I haue séene the pages, seruants, wiues and women in <span class="hi">Don Iohn</span> of <span class="hi">Austria</span> his campe, attend in no lesse good order, then any well gouerned band.</p><p>And for as much as it appertaineth chiefly to the high Mashal to gouerne the execution of the Militarie lawes, I therein refer him to my first booke, wherein I thought it more necessary to be set downe then in this place, to the intent the souldiers may dayly heare their dueties, and not to offend through ignorance: vnto which lawes some thinke it necessarie, that not onely eue­rie Captaine and Collonel should be sworne, but also after the old Romaine manner, euery particular souldier at his entring into pay, or at the consecration of the Ensigne, to make his oath ioyntly vnto them both, for which cause the Romaine warfare was termed <span class="hi">Militia Sacrata.</span></p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.3"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10498"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=132">[Page 244]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.4.3. </span><span class="head">The oathes that euerie officer ought to take of what office soeuer he be.</span></h4><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.3_div.1"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.4.3.1. </span><span class="head">Of the Pretor.</span></h5><p>THe Pretor, Aduocate or Coadiutor to the Marshall, being learned in the Martiall, Ciuill and commmon Lawes, shall take his oath giuen him by the Generall, &amp; shall sweare by al­mighty God, that whatsoeuer he shal iudge, ordain, or determine in court or out of court, that he shal kéepe it close &amp; secreat to his liues end, &amp; that he shal be true and iust to the Lords, and that he shall execute iustice to his vtmost power, and that he shal not du­ring the wars take any gift of any man, for any matter in con­trouersie to be tried before him, but shall vse indifferent iustice to al mē, without respect of persons, friendship or malice, as God shall helpe him at the dreadfull day of iudgement.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.3_div.2"><h5><span class="headingNumber">1.4.3.2. </span><span class="head">Of the Prouost Marshall.</span></h5><p>HIs oath is likewise giuen by the Generall, that he shall sée al faults duely and according to the lawes punished in al offen­ders, without regard or respect of persons.

But when he cannot shun the same, then must he prouide at leastwise, to enter into the action thereof, to his great aduantage, and almost with a certaine hope of victory, the which will not arise to be difficile, if he can apply the aduan­tage of situations to serue his turne.</p><p>In marching, I would wish him to haue one part of his light horsemen so neere the enemie, that euery houre he may haue no­tice what way he dooth march, notwithstanding in a countrie where mounts and hils be not fauourable, but that of necessitie you must march through plaines and champaine countries, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10569"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=133">[Page 246]</a></span> that the enemie is néere at hand, and that it is very hard to shun the battell, I iudge it not farre amisse, to accept the battell, so that you be of greater strength in horsemen, for being the stronger, the iourney in no respect is to be fled, for so much as horsemen yéeld the greatest part of the victorie, when they bee well guided.</p><p><span class="hi">Charles</span> the fift in Germany against the protestants armie, by reason of the commoditie of the ground, for the most part, did not lodge his army further off from his enemies, then common­ly the shot of a Coluerine, although he was far inferior in num­ber. Neuerthelesse that order cannot be alwaies vsed when an armie is in the champaine countrie, for he that is in plaines and is not desirous to fight, he must march from the enemie 9 or 10 miles, and must determine to fortifie himselfe at each lodging, in such sort that neither the enemies <span class="hi">Cauallarie</span> or infanterie, may be able in battell to enter into his campe, if not with great difficultie.</p><p>A meane fortification is sufficient in a champaine countrie, chiefely when it is to be made with spéede, which beginning of fortification, when you meane to continue, may encrease and be made as strong as you sée the case doth require. When an armie dooth march inplaines and champaine countries, &amp; that it comes to that point, y<sup>e</sup> it is able to haue any little riuer or wood which may couer one flanke of the said armie, you must go about with all diligence to take this aduantage, for that the same will arise to be of great importance. Prouide euer that the bagage and the artillarie go continually on the contrarie side to the enemie, or at leastwise in the midst of the armie. The squadrons of men at armes must as appertaineth, flanke the battels and rankes of footmen towards the enemie.</p><p>It is a laudable custome to deuide an armie into thrée squa­drons, that is to say, into the auantgard battell, and arrear­gard, and that euery day they do exchange, making of the auant­gard the battell, and of the battell the reargard, &amp; it is requisite, that euery one of them haue his necessary number of horsmen &amp; Hargaloteares, &amp; that each one be disposed and placed in his due ranke. Order must be carefully taken, that amongst the ranks of the footmen, vnprofitable people be not intermedled, but that all the baggage be in a place deputed for the same, vnder the Pro­uosts <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10598"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=133">[Page 247]</a></span> guidon. Also that amongst the squadrons of the horsemen, there be no vnprofitable horses nor other impediments. The Rutters <span class="hi">Cauallaries</span> vse héerein a meruailous strict order, and extreame diligence, which verily dooth merit to be imitated. It is a commendable thing also, when the light horsmen be in such sort deuided and dispersed for discouerie of the countrie, and es­pying the actions of the enemies armie, as that they may conti­nually returne and giue intelligences of the enemies demeanor, whereby if néede require, commoditie and leasure may be had to prouide for fight.</p><p>If the marshall of the field haue no experience of the countrie himselfe, it is requisite that he carrie such a personage, or wor­thie <span class="hi">Cauallier</span> with him, as he knowes to haue experience, that with them he may consider well of the situation and place, whe­ther he is to march with his armie through plaines, by or néere hils, or in valleys that haue hils ou both sides, or by or néere to woods, or alongst or néere a riuer. It is also requisite y<sup>e</sup> the light horse, aswell for the discouerie of the enemie, as otherwise to take the bredth of the straits &amp; passages go before, and to make certificate, that according to the bredth the hoast may march.</p><p>And put case that one part of the way be 15. foot broode, the hoast shall be made to march by fiue in a ranke, because euery footman will haue thrée foote in breadth from shoulder to shoulder, and sixe foote in ranke betwixt ranke and ranke, and one foote for e­uerie person, so that 21 foote in breadth and 2 myles in length, will containe an armie of ten thousand. After the same reason, whether there be 20 or 30 thousand footemen, according to the measuring of ground by the foote, they may be set in order very easily, neither can the leader be deceiued, whē he knoweth how many armed men euery place can containe: and after the same order as the place dooth enlarge, he must enlarge the rankes, causing part of the shot to goe before the aray, and part behind, and others to go in succoures of the horsemen, that go in view­ing the passages, and the ambushments, with the whole dooings of the enemie: and let an other part be for vantgard &amp; retrogard to the aray, to be able to serue them at néed, and an other part to go alwaies at the flankes of the raie, the which if there be dit­ches, shal serue as a countermure against the enemies horsmen. And if they be men at armes, they must march on both the sides <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10631"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=134">[Page 248]</a></span> of the battell, and also of the Hargabuzies that do march by the flankes of the battell, and the light horsemen to serue for scoutes both before and behind the aray.</p><p>There must be likewise abundance of Pyoners and labou­rers to make places plaine, and to cast downe ditches &amp; bridges, and to make defences and other necessarie things that are re­quired in marching, the which must be garded by your light horse and shot, and when you depart to faine to go to some other place, then that you go so, and if there be no men at armes to appoint to euery regiment certaine Hargabuziers to serue on horsebacke, the which may serue in stéed of men at armes, and when occasion serues to serue on foote againe, wherein the <span class="hi">Ca­ualiers</span> of S. <span class="hi">Georges</span> squadre, may very well be imployed. It is requisite that all souldiers follow their leaders, and carrie a great care and diligence in marching, to the intent that by sud­den assaults they be not at euerie step to arise in a rumor, and confusedly to runne héere and there, and the one to go contrarie to the other, and finally comming about them, not to be able to do any thing of any profit.</p><p>For which cause thou oughtest to march with thine armie through euery place in battell ray, whereby the souldiers may be made more apt and spéedie to make a voyage, and quicke and ready to resist if néed shall be. The Souldiers according to my former directions, being trained to follow the Ensignes, &amp; apt to obey commaundements, and to behaue themselues valiantly according to their place and order, if thou march in a plaine countrie, it is requisite that thy pikes march in battell ray, re­tiring thine armie into a little space, so that by the straightnes and facilitie of inlarging, thou be not constrained to extend thy selfe into too much length, which fashion of marching séemes to giue occasion and power to the enemie, to assault commodiously their aduersaries, &amp; according to the occasion to endomage them, he beholding the commoditie to defend themselues to be taken away, forasmuch either with more largenesse comming against thée, the which is woont to happen both the hornes being com­passed, it is like that he shall easily disorder thée, and put thée to flight, or els giuing charge on the flanke in the midst of the bat­tell, hauing already broken thine order, sodenly stop thy men from being able to go forward, being closed in the arayes of the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10657"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=134">[Page 249]</a></span> enemies. Wherefore minding to retire in a maine battell, and to returne to resist, they shall be able to do little good, as those that haue vsed such a maine battell, which for want of thicknes is nothing strong, but altogether weake. Also if the enemie should charge thée on the rearward, thou shalt be brought to the very same necessitie, because thou shalt be so compassed, as thy fronts shall not be able to succour the last, or the last to succour the first. For the which thing it is alwaies better and more sure and easier to gouerne the bands that march close and square, thē thin and long: especially, forasmuch as to an army that marcheth long, oftentimes happens that of some thing séeme doubtful and vncertaine, there groweth suddenly feare and terror, because sometimes it hath chaunced, that men discending from high and hillie places into the plaine, to places expedient and open, and the formost séeing the last of the same band by a great distance to come after, supposing themselues to be assaulted of some am­bush of enemies, it hath béene séene that they haue suddenly tur­ned to fight, &amp; afterwards no otherwise thē enemies gone toge­ther by the eares with their owne companions. If, as I said be­fore, the victuales, carriages, and munition, be not conducted in the midst of the armie, but if otherwise the hindermost part would be garded &amp; defended of the most valiant souldiers, as in the fronts, because that at vnawares may happen many things, thy light horsmen going before, disciphering and espying where they may passe, hauing occasion to passe by mountaines, woodes, places closed with hils, and most great desarts, because the ene­mie many times will lay an ambush priuilie by the passage to assault his aduersarie, who taking little héed thereof, haue béene easily broken and brought to vtter decay. The which ambush, if the conductor by way of exploratoures shall foresée, with a little paine, hauing preuented the suares of the enemie, may win a worthie name of politike prudence, and likewise saue his armie from imminent ruine. And as for the plaines, thou with thine owne eies maist sée a far of, forasmuch as in the day dust mooued and lifted vp into the aire, dooth shew the moouing and stirring of the enemy, and in the night the fires and flames signifieth the campe to be there. When thy men are to be conducted, and not fight, thou oughtest to remooue by day, if peraduenture some thing do not constraine thée, for the which thou thinkest it good <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10677"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=135">[Page 250]</a></span> to go in hast to come before thine enemie, where in déed for such occasion thou must remooue in the night, so that thou know it may safely be doone to fight with the enemie. Lead th<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> me<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> not in hast, but softly, &amp; inforce them not to make two long a iourney, forasmuch as labour taken before a man come to fight, is se<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ne very often vainly to consume and waste the strength of their ho­bies. And marching in the country of thy friends, it is néedful to commaund thy souldiers, that in no manner of wise they touch or spoile any thing, but rather altogether to refraine, considering that souldiers hauing weapons and liberty to doe what shall please them, will fauour nothing, especially for that the <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ight of things that please men, out of doubt is woo<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>t most dange­rously to lead ignorant and vnwarie men to desire them, and with the swéetnesse of robbing to eutice them to all manner of mischéefe: wherevnto if thou prouide not, thy fréends &amp; thy con­federates, for very small occasions will become enemies: not­withstanding, the countrie of thy enemies, thou shalt suffer thy souldiers openly to destroy, bur<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e &amp; consume, because by y<sup>e</sup> dearth of victuals &amp; lack of money, wars are woont to deminish and be extinguished, and contrariwise through aboundance and riches, they are nourished and maint<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ined: but first before thou suffer thine enemies countrie to be destroyed, thou shouldest giue ad­uise to thy enemies, threatning them what thou wilt do, if they will not yéeld vnto thée, for y<sup>e</sup> the perril of the misery prepared, &amp; the feare of the ruine looked for, oftentimes constraines men to grant many things, the which at the first by no maner of means had bin possible to haue brought thē to passe: but after they haue once receaued the hurt, they will make little account of thée, and dispise all other things, as though thou couldest do them no more harme. Albeit i<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> thou knowest surely that in the country of thine enemies thou must tarrie long with thine army, suffer to be ta­ken &amp; spoiled those things only, which thou séest wil not be great­ly profitable vnto thée: but the same which is to be thought may be preserued for thy commodity, cōmand openly to thy souldiers, that they for beare. Hauing made ready and set in order thy men, tarry not long in thy owne country, nor yet in thy confederates, least that consuming all thy prouision, it séeme not that thou art of greater hurt to thy fréends thē to thy enemies, but rather con­duct thy army spéedily into thy enemies country, whereby if it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10745"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=135">[Page 251]</a></span> be fertile and aboundant, there may be taken at thy néede most plentiously those things that thou list: but if it be otherwise, thou shalt cause to be knowne, y<sup>t</sup> thou séekest to prouide most louingly both for y<sup>e</sup> wealth &amp; profit of thy fréends. Besides this thou ough­test to care with al diligence, that marching or incamping by sea or land, victuals may safely be brought, for somuch as by such means the merchants with all diligence will bring all things, which for y<sup>e</sup> vse of an army wil be necessary. Moreouer whē thou most passe by straights, or march through rough &amp; hilly wayes, thē is it cōuenient, principally for y<sup>e</sup> preseruation of thy things, to send before shot on horseback &amp; on foot, for the kéeping of those places, rocks, or inclosed waies, least the enemy taking it before thée, may both let thy passage to thy great hinderance &amp; losse: the contrary thou ought enforce thy selfe to do, when thou vnderstan­dest the enemy to passe, the like thou hast not onely to take héede for receiuing harme, but to inforce thy selfe to turne against the enemy those deceits whereby he thought to deceaue thée. And when thou purposest to go against him, it is requisite to pro­uide before him, &amp; at vnawares oppresse him: so diligently thou must find means to let &amp; endomage him euery way, if thou vn­derstandest that he intends to pursue thée. The marshall of the field must foresée, y<sup>e</sup> whether soeuer y<sup>e</sup> army doth retire, or vse an ordinary march &amp; iourney, that the captains that lead distinct &amp; seuerall bands, must with mutuall diligence by horsemē, riding to and fro, measure the march of the army, neither suffer the En­signes to go any thing out of sight. The auantgard to obserue with what pace the middle battell marcheth, and so likewise the middle battell the rereward, that euery battell may be ready at hand for all sodaine incursions of the enemy, &amp; to succor y<sup>e</sup> battell which is circumuented, &amp; finally fight if a man be forced, or ad­uantage doth serue, with al y<sup>e</sup> power of the army vnited together.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.4.6. </span><span class="head">Of the order of the march in figure, and of the placing of the weapons.</span></h4><p>Forsomuch as there are diuers formes of marching, according to the ground and diuersities of mens minds, I haue onely thought it good to set downe this figure ensuing, as very necessa­rie, and of great force for an armie, with his whole carriages to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10805"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=136">[Page 252]</a></span> march withall: Wherein I partly imitate the antiquitie, as otherwise the order now vsed, as for example.

When any ar­mie is therefore in such place to be encamped, you shall first in the most commodious place about the midst of the ground, where you meane to encampe, set vp the generall standard or Guidon, and about the same, stake out a square plot of ground 40 pace square for the Generals pauillion. Directly from this towards the North, runneth one maine stréete 40 pace brode, that deui­deth the horse campe from the foot campe: &amp; on either side of the Generals tent runneth two other crosse waies, 30 pace in bredth, which deuide the armed frō the vnarmed, as héerafter appeares. These two waies embrace two long squares of ground 40 pace brode, and 550 pace long a péece. These may be either of them deuided into 5 lodgings of 100 pace in length, and 40 in bredth, leauing betwéene them certaine passages of ten pace in bredth, that souldiers vpon euery sodaine may the more readily repaire to the place of assemblie. One of these lodgings next the Gene­rals tent, may serue for the high marshall himselfe and his re­tinue, &amp; the other on the other side for the treasurer: the rest may be assigned at the marshals discretion to the other officers of the field, and for Ambassadors, and such Noblemen and Gentlemen as follow the wars on their owne charge, and such like. In the Northeast quarter of the campe are the horsemen lodged, in the northwest the footemen, either of these campes are deuided into thrée parts by stréetes running East and West. These stréetes are 20 pace in bredth, and 580 pace in length. In euerie one of these thrée spaces of the foote campe, there are lodged a regiment of 10000 men: &amp; in the horsecampe the middlemost of them shall serue for 1500 men at armes: the northen space may serue for the 2500 light horsemen, &amp; the other for 2000 launces.

For when y<sup>e</sup> enimies <span class="hi">Cauallarie</span> haue attained him, they will easily constraine him to stay, and force him to fight against his will with great disorder, and specially if he conduct Artille­rie and other impediments appertaining to an armie, which no reason would that he should leaue in pray and spoile to the ene­mies. Moreouer an army must not be made to march faster then his ordinarie pace: for if it should be hastned with an extraor­dinarie spéedie pace, the same would augment the euill opinion the souldier<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span> haue had to cōceaue by reason of their retire, which is a very dangerous thing, for thereby may arise a disorder without redresse, as oftentimes hath béene experimented.

Therefore I say, by the <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> of the situation of the ground and countrie, a man may assure his re­traite, as by these examples appeares.

But the massiue wall of stone, greater ruine is made by the enemy thē sometimes he desires, and with small labour, which onely comes to passe by the stubborne resistance of the firme and massiue deade wall: the which the Artillarie for the most part, as well farre of the battery, as néere it, only by y<sup>e</sup> forceable shaking therof, brings great confusion to the defenders.</p><p>Therefore besides these foresaid aduertisements, it is conue­nient a good Souldiour, haue long practise of the effects, &amp; extreme force of the Artillarie, and of the diligent arte and infinite polli­cies, vsed of souldiours of valour, the which is farre more then a­ny witte of small practise can imagine, since that he is not capable of any thing, but that his simple iudgement doth behold.</p><p>And for thys respect, besides a particuler profession in this art, it behoues hym of necessity to be able to draw proportions.

But he must prouyde that the sayd Para­pettes be so placed, that very commodiously the Artillarie, the Muskets, the Hargabuziers, and all other sortes of offensiue wea­pons, may play and trouble the Enimy, without being (as is af­foresayde) manifestly disturbed and displanted by the enimy.</p><p>Touching the entryes or Gates which bee made to enter into Fortresses: they ought to bee made in the midst of the Curtine, or rather neere adioyning to the flanke of the Bulwarke: with a bridge of wood, to the intent that in time of siege, the same may be cut downe or burnt. The Porte ought to be so lowe, that being on the Counterscarpe without, the same remayne discouerd. It is requisite also, that at the entrie of the sayd Porte, there be a safe place for diuers respects: and specially to keepe assured the Soul­diours <span class="hi">Armes.</span></p><p>In the bottome of the Merlone, or rather néere adioyning to the flancke of the Bulwarke, an issue must be made, which may serue for the Souldiours (whilst the batterie is in making) to issue foorth: to the intent also they may defende the Dytch, and take a­way the ruines of the batterie, because they would hinder the Cannoniers, and be a meanes that the enemie myght approch the néerer.</p><p>There be many which require that the Curtines shold com­passe, or be bended inward towardes the Fortresse, with a plat­forme eyther within or without, or a <span class="hi">Caualiere</span> vpon the brinke of the sayd Curtine. They alledge for theyr reason, that the enemy thereby is much more endomaged, and that his battery is more crooked, and therefore procures lesse danger to the Fortresse then if it were straight. But I am of an opinion, that if a man worke in that sort, the bulwarks cannot haue theyr ample places, and thicke sholders, to be able to sustaine the blowes of the Artillarie, and euen so it should be likewise difficile to make retraites.</p><p>Therefore I thinke it is not good to haue the Curtines folded compasse wise or crooked, if the situation of the place doo not re­quire the same. But I would rather they should be straight from <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12297"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=156">[Page 288]</a></span> one Bulwarke to another.</p><p>And furthermore, it were good that they were of such length, that not only the great Cannons of the first place, but also the smal Peeces may clense the front of y<sup>e</sup> Bulwarke. Some perchance wil affirme, that the Curtyne being short, the great Cannons would become hurtfull to the Bulwarks of the Fortresse. For aunswere whereof, I say: That in the first place when the enimie doth as­sault the Forte, the great Cannons ought not to bee charged with bullets, for defence of the sayd Forte: but rather filde with peeces of yron, or of some other Mettall, or with stones or chaynes, for these thinges worke a marueilous effect, against the assaults and Escalades which the Enimie doth giue.</p><p>To shoote bullets in great Cannons were good, when the Ditch is full of Rockes and heapes of stones: for the sayd Bullet striking amidst the sayd he apes of stones, dispearsing &amp; sparkeling them, will make a great slaughter of those which giue the assault. Bullets in the great Cannons be good also to break the Trenches and Engines, which the enimies make within the Dith: Moreo­uer the length of the Curtine beeing correspondent to the carying of the small Peeces, is cause that the shot of the sayde Peeces, be­comes the dispatch and mortalitie of the Enimies, and the defence and sustentation of the Fortresse: for almost against all Fortres­ses, the Enimie worketh vnder the Curtine with Trenches, in cutting through the Counterscarpe, or rather by filling of y<sup>•</sup> ditch, thereby the more commodiously to cut the sayde Curtine or Bul­warke, and so make steppes or degrees, to ascende to giue assault to the Fortresse: as I sawe performed at the siege of <span class="hi">Limbourgh,</span> the head Citty of that Dutchie, where the Prince of <span class="hi">Parma</span> being Lieuete<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ant of the Armie, in <span class="hi">Don Iohn d'austria</span> hys absence, betwixt the batterie and the breach in bottome of the dry Ditch, certaine close couerts were made, from whence the Souldiers might ascend vp to giue the assault, by certayne steppes cut out of the hyll and Bulwarke it selfe, by which the towne was entred, although in ende it yeelded.</p><p>It is profitable to haue water in the ditch, when a Fortresse is situate in such a place, that it borders vppon diuers Enimies: for water brings with it this comodity, that vnawares in the night, it cannot be assaulted by Escalade. Water likewise is profitable to small Fortresses, wherein there is not such great numbers of peo­ple, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12338"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=156">[Page 289]</a></span> as one may be able to make issue for the defence thereof.</p><p>But for a great Fortresse where it is necessary to make sal­lies, it is requisite the ditch be dry, for that in the same a man hath space to make retraites, and is farre more commodious to make issues and sallies, to defende the sayd Ditch, specially if the bancke descending from the Curtine, bee cutte rounde with couert and close Trenches, euen with the Counterscarpe: as was about the dry Ditch of <span class="hi">Louayne,</span> vnder the gouernment of my Collonell the <span class="hi">Baron</span> of <span class="hi">Cheuerau,</span> when we did dayly attend the siege of 60000. men in Campe by <span class="hi">Machlin,</span> guided by <span class="hi">Casamire</span> and the <span class="hi">Counte Bossu. 1578.</span></p><p>Lyke wise a Ditch being dry, one may comodiously take away the ruines, which the Enimyes make with theyr batteries: to the intent the sayde ruines, doe not serue the Enimie for a Ladder or steppes, to mount vp to the Fortresse, and for a Trench.</p><p>A dry Ditch hath likewise thys good cōmoditie, that when the Enimy would fill it with Fagotes, they may be the more easilie burnt, the which woulde not come to passe, if water were in the same, which doth extinguish fyre, and make the Ditch more easie to be filde.</p><p>Water is lykewise more daungerous in the time of Frost: for that being frosen, it maketh the walles more apt and easie to bee scaled and surprised. The dry Ditch is in this to be commended, that when the Souldiers sallie out to skirmishe, or do any other action, and would retyre by reason of the violent charge the Eni­mye giues them, they may saue themselues in the dry Ditch, if the draw bridge of the Fortresse were forced to be drawn vp.</p><p>A drye Ditch is lykewise good, that vpon any suddayne affaire or inuasion in tyme of warre, one may saue the Cattell of the ad­ioyning Country, within the sayd Ditches.</p><p>Notwithstanding all these deuises for y<sup>e</sup> defending of a Fortres being cōsidered, yet am I of a groūded opinion, that it is no wyse­dome to put such assured repose and trust in a Fortresse, howe strong soeuer it be, and how well victualled and furnished with all necessary thinges, that it is able of it selfe continually or any long tyme, to resist the force of a Royall Armie: For ether the Defen­dours become wearie, or by warlike sallies deuoured, wasted, and so by little and little, remayne consumed, or else the munition and the victualles, the which consists of infinite thinges, do fayle, if <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12394"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=157">[Page 290]</a></span> not in all respects, at leastwise in some particulers: the which, al­though it séeme to haue beene very little, yet hath it béene manie times the occasion of a generall losse: so that it dooth much more ensue when the principall things doo want, as water, wood, bread, wine, beare, vineger, salt, dryed flesh, and such like particulari­ties, necessary for mans life.</p><p>Moreouer, these things following, may procure the losse and ruine of a Fortresse, fyring of the Munition, the vaine consuming of the same, or by the meanes of Mutinies, secrete treasons, the death of some principall person, or els the deuouring domage which the sundry shots of the Artillary hath made: and cheefelie where somtimes dooth want matter to repaire y<sup>e</sup> ruine of a breach, and to stop vp y<sup>e</sup> battered wall. Sometimes the carelesse dilligence of the Captaines and souldiours defendants, suffer the Towne to be wonne by Mynes.

With fiue or sixe thousande Pyoners, they begin a rowling Trench, somwhat far from the Ditches, and neuer cease day nor night, vntill they haue perfor­med theyr enterprise, wherfore they place their Pyoners by garde and course, that one part workes whilst another rests, and when the earth is at the beginning raised the height of a man, and of the largenes that the same Trenches is to be made, there doe some of the Pyoners stand aloft, to cast vp the earth that those beneath cast vnto them, and so they alwaies continue, euen vntil such time as they haue made a Mountaine, neere to the Ditch. And when they be there, they make Bastillions, to withstand the sallies that those of the Towne might make vpon the Pyoners, &amp; so alwaies wyth great numbers of Pyoners, they cast thys Mountaine into the Ditch, the which consequently béeing as high or higher then the wall, they enter with the same into the Fortresse, and so at their pleasure expugne the same, against which, it séemes that nei­ther men nor Artillary can preuaile to vse defence, but that time will eate them out.</p><p>Yet thys notwithstanding, euery Fortresse in a Frontire, or vpon the border of any Country of importance, ought to be made as strong as is possible, without sparing of any cost, who although they cannot as is aforesaid, resist the reall force of an Armie, ne­uerthelesse <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12429"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=157">[Page 291]</a></span> they may entertaine and deferre time after time, vn­till such time as the part assaulted doo resolue to entreate of peace, truce, or accord: or els procure such prouision, as shall be suffici­ent for his defence vntil succour arriue to relieue the besi<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ged.

And although sometymes they haue not fallen out according to mans pretence, the same did aryse rather, because they were not well made, then for any other respect. Heerein diuers reasons may be alleaged. Amongst others it hath béene tryed, that going about to mine walles or Platformes, the fyre hath burst out, and forced that part towards the mouth, which was artificially stopt, rather then to ouerthrow and ruine the Bulwarke as was determined.</p><p>The same might easily fall out, by reason there was small height giuen to the Caue or vaute, and that by that meanes, shee coulde not take her accustomed force, to ryse vpwarde and worke the effect: but contrariwise she bursteth out, by that parte which is most féeble, without working very little or any domage at all to the Fortresse.</p><p>To confirme this saying, I will speake that which hath béen seene by experience, that is, hauing put powder not in great quan titie within Caues and Chambers, which haue not béene entyre­ly stopt: but haue diuers issues, as doores and windows, the same hath procured great ruines, and much more then a man woulde thinke.</p><p>Therefore in mine opinion, the same hath come to passe, for that the fyre hath had both space and height to worke his forces: the which hath beene such, as there hath beene no obstacle or en­counter, which woulde haue béene sufficient to haue repressed the same, and sent it to the open places, but it hath wrought and per­formed his course, according to the effect of his nature. Therfore when these Caues or Uautes are made, as dooth appertaine, gy­uing them such forme, as this Element may worke his force and effect, certaynely they bring foorth marueilous effects.</p><p>But for that these thinges are necessary to be entreated of in particulers, I will beginne a fresh to d<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>late somewhat more largely thereof. Therefore when an Armie doth march to besiege any Citty: It is necessary before hand, to examine the intelli­gences of such persons, as perfectly knowe the situation thereof, the strength, and all the wayes and passages vnto the same. And hauing together with the principall Captaynes, made full dis­course thereof, for theyr perfect instruction: determination must be made, what is to be done vppon theyr approch to the Towne, and what lodgings must be ceased vpon at the first, whether one, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12722"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=161">[Page 299]</a></span> two, or more according to the situation of the place, and as is most conuenient. For it is euer much better, for two reasons, to lodge euen at the first, as neere vnto the Portes and Gates as it is pos­sible.</p><p>The one is, that the enemy thereby shall be much abashed and discouraged: the other is, that they shall haue no leysure to burne, the adioyning houses, where the Army may lodge, if before it be not already done: neither shall these bee hindered, to take their Lodgings, or mount their Artillarie, to goe to that lodging a fresh vpon an other day. Sometime it hath béene séene, that the Armie hath planted &amp; lodged it selfe, before 3 or 4 gates at one in­stant, one part of the Campe as soone as an other, the which hath beene tryed very good, so that there were people enough in the Armie. The Marshall of the hoast must be accompanied, with so forcible and strong a band of horsemen and footemen, that he may ouermatch those of the Town: who, if they chaunce to sallie forth either on foote or on horse-backe, to repulse them as furiously as is possible, euen within the Gates: for sometimes there falles out such disorder and confusion, that either they may enter <span class="hi">Pesle Mesle,</span> or kill some <span class="hi">Chiestana,</span> or make such a slaughter of Souldi­ours, that the Towne shal be much the sooner taken: at the least­wise vpon the repulse, the Master Gunner or Ingeniour, follow­ing the great Marshall, may haue commodity to view and disco­uer the places and plottes, where the Artillarie is to be planted, &amp;c. Which beeing accomplished, the Marshall is to sound the re­traite, and to lodge as néere the Towne as is possible, so that it be without the batterie.</p><p>The approches be made by Trenches, and Maunds, &amp; Wooll sackes, as before I haue declared, and as heereafter may appeare by figures, in the defence of a Town. Neuerthelesse, they must be accommodated according to the situation of the grounde, and tur­ned and compassed according to the opposite Bulwarkes of the e­nemy, the which are to bee begun<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>e in the night, specially the planting of the batterie.</p><p>The Trenches are to be made, high, great, large, and déepe, for the safety of the Soldiours, and such men of account as vse to come into them: in respect that the Prince himselfe, may some­times goe into them, neuertheles verie seldome.</p><p>The Trenches beeing begunne where the Artillarie is, they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12763"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=162">[Page 300]</a></span> must be continued on euen to the Gates, thereby to cut of sallies. And against all the Portes, make a Bulwarke of Gabions, one vppon an other, and if it bee possible, néerer the Towne then the Trenches, both to stoppe their battery alongst the Trenches, and to barre theyr sallies.</p><p>Upon that side towardes the Campe, must be made Ditches &amp; little Trenches, for y<sup>e</sup> <span class="hi">Corps de Garde,</span> of those that must guard the Trenches, wherein must remayne such number of Combat­tants, as they may be able to repulse the enemie vntil succour ar­riue, which must be vpon great necessity: and then beeing ayded with some mayne squadrone, to repulse them with great furie.</p><p>For the better prohibiting and knowledg of which issues and sallies, it is not only requisite, to aduaunce the Trenches euen to the Counterscarpe and brincke of the Ditch, but also to haue lost Sentinelles euery night betwixt the Towne and the Trenches, within the sayd Ditch, if it be dry. Wherein lykewise a good In­geniour, may worke many good deuises.</p><p>The Marshall must if occasion serue, fortifie towardes the Champayne, place the Princes or Generals lodging in the midst of the Campe, that he may giue order to all mutinies, sallies, alla­rums, and disorders. And if the Towne be well peopled, to make certaine such Fortes as before I haue set downe, gouerned wyth valiant Captaynes, and good bandes of Soldiours, to kéepe shorte the enemy. And those lodgings or Campes so well distributed, that they may remayne safe from inuasion, yet so apt to come to­gether, that vpon the ariuall of any Armie, they may at one in­stant issue out, and be ranged together in battaile to fight: and therefore if a Riuer passe through the Towne, a bridge must be placed to passe ouer, guarded at both endes with bandes of Soul­diours, that thereby victualles and succours may be barred from the enemy. It is rather to be placed aboue, then beneath vpon the Riuer, in respect to auoyde burning by artificiall fyre, or else to be planted where they looke chéefely for succours.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5_div.6"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.5.6. </span><span class="head">Obseruations for an assault, and the sacke of a Citty.</span></h4><p>WHen the batterie of the Cannous haue made sufficient breach, and that the same is saultable, great diligence and celeritie is to be vsed, for that diuers thinges at one instant are to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12797"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=162">[Page 301]</a></span> be done.

Then must the Pyoners roul forward the artificiall Bridge, made vpon Barrels of purpose for that respect, hauing before cut the Counterscarpe to put the same into the ditch: the which must be done nimblie, and at one instant.

And from the time they begin to march, the Artillarie must shoote: to the end, the enemies haue no leysure, to shoote at them that march in the Ditches.</p><p>And when they are within the sayd Ditches, the small Ar­tillarie must alwaies batter at the defences and breach, vntill such time as thy come hande to hande.

And likewise the Cannoniers ought to be readie at that instant to doo theyr duetie, if it so chaunce. For it is the custome of the besieged, at the repulse of an Assault, the soul­diours more willingly doo show themselues, and appeare carelesly at the breaches then at the beginning, through the hart and cou­rage they haue taken to sée theyr enemies repulsed, and likewise at the loope holes, and ouer the Rampiers, for they thinke thē that no man can hurt them.

Other wise, it were almost impossible to constraine any one to kéepe order, but that euery one woulde be at the spoyle.</p><p>Immediatly vpon the taking of the Towne, the Prince or Generall, béeing accompanied with 20. or 30. <span class="hi">Caualieres,</span> and o­ther of his Garde, must enter into the Towne, with his sworde naked in his hand, and must goe to the principall Church to giue God thanks for his victorie, and also to defend, that the ornaments which appertaine to the Church be not pylled nor robbed, &amp; must leaue people to garde the same. And if the enemie doo not stand to theyr defence in the Churches, he must prohibite and hinder to his power that no blood be shedde in them, for the house of God ought to be pure and frée from slaughters.</p><p>And from thence he must goe to other Churches, and by and in the streetes likewise, hinder such euils.

And of some, that they did all withdrawe themselues within the Towne, and lodge there. Which two contrarieties, I leaue to the discretion of the Chiefe­taines: vnlesse the Campe béeing very well fortefyed and acco­modated, and contrariwise the Towne small and straight of lod­ging: in this case I would wish them to retire to the Campe, es­pecially if you meane to put a Garison in the Towne, thereby to auoyde the spoyle of victuals, and other confusions.</p><p>But if the Campe be not well fortefied, and that you doo feare the comming of the Enemie, and that the Towne be wide and great, sufficient to lodge your Armie: then shal it be good to enter the Towne, for it shall be hard vpon occasion when necessitie re­quires, to cause all the Souldiours to retyre out of the Towne to the fielde, but that a great part will remaine behind, vnlesse a man will sette the whole Towne on fyre, which is the onely way to cause them abandon the Towne, and otherwise not, but with great labour and length of time.</p><p>Thus haue I partly touched what is to be doone at the assault of a Towne, at the sacke thereof, and after the spoyle. Onelie I haue omitted, that the great Maister of the Artillary, to procure a spéedie battery, must now and then, to harten and encourage the Gunners, giue them seuerally and vpon occasion, certaine péeces of money or gold, to make them apply a pace the battery.</p><p>And likewise that the Generall, when the souldiours stande readie to giue the assault, and that they be in order to march, that he cause to be published before the Assailants, that the first which foreseth the breach and enters the Towne, shal haue such a sum of money by him limitted, and the second so much, which is lesse, and the third not so much as the other two. The which shal make them more couragiously to kisse the ground, and to aduance them selues forwarde, to repulse the Enemie valiantly, and to enter tryumphantly.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5_div.7"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12961"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=165">[Page 306]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.5.7. </span><span class="head">What is to be obserued of those, which haue charge giuen them to keepe and defende a Fortresse, and what re­medies they haue to saue themselues at a siege, batterie, and assault.</span></h4><p>HAuing presently declared, how to besiege and expugne a hold, I will now declare the order of the kéeping of a Fortresse, and the meanes wherewith the besieged are to defend themselues, an action to be performed, as well with the quicknes of the spirit, as the prowesse of the body.</p><p>Now for that the defence of a Cittie or any Fortresse, is one of the most important affayres, that can in the warres be com­mitted to any mans charge, it is very necessary for him that is to carrie such a burden, that he be very hardie, of good experience, very vigilant, and excéeding rich in inuentions, to the intent hée may be able, redily to resolue vpon all suddaine chaunces, as well to repayre the ruine the Artillary makes, as to furnish himselfe a­gainst diuers accidents that doo fall out, not onely through the want of courage in the Souldiours, but also by reason of the co­wardise and clamours of the people, whereby many inconueni­ences doe arise.</p><p>Wherefore he must with his prudent and haughtie courage, resist and striue against the feare and ignoraunce of hys people, carrying in his countenaunce such a maiestie and grauitie, that his commaundements may be of euery one reuerenced, approo­ued for good and performed.</p><p>But he cannot enioy these qualities, if hee be not a person of experience, and that in times past hath yéelded good account, and honourable effects of himselfe in his actions.</p><p>Moreouer, it is necessary that he shew himselfe most forward of all men, each where, as greatest dangers of importaunce doe principally fall out. Hée must likewise be able with his spéech to encourage his people, for in great affaires &amp; dangers, if a Chiefe­taine cannot serue turne by these meanes, feare wil easily slide in­to the harts of his Souldiours, which afterwards can not bee plucked out but with great paine.</p><p>It is likewise requisite he be of such a nature, that he willing­ly suffer to speake, and giue eare to those which would giue hym <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12994"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=165">[Page 307]</a></span> aduise and counsaile, yea euen of the simple Souldiours, for often times very profitable things be learned of such persons: and ma­ny good counsailes haue béene found hid in a man of base conditi­on.

But as the nature of many people is diffe­rent, so I thinke it not alwaies conuenient, to vse lenetie &amp; curte­sie, principally towardes souldiours: Neyther also is it alwayes expedient, to vse terrour and threatnings.

For if these rumors or opinions should once take roote, it shall be afterwards very difficile to stoppe the Souldiours from Mutintes. Let him therefore foresee, that hee preuent the follow­ing of these and all other daungerous euents. Wherefore euerie Chiefetaine, ought to haue this poynt in singuler recommendati­on, for that it toucheth him particulerly, and is of great impor­taunce for the conseruation of his credite and honour. And accor­ding to my iudgement, he shall much more content his Prince, if he loose the same intirely, with magnanimitie of courage, rather then he should yeelde the same with most honourable conditions. For in those conditions dooth not consist the entire satis-faction of his Prince, if it be not that hee be thereunto expresly commaun­ded, and in that case must accept the condition appointed him.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13029"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=166">[Page 308]</a></span>Hée must not haue regard to the sauing of his souldiours, nei­ther to theyr desire: for when the Chiefetaine dooth commit anie fault more then his duetie, the souldiours beare not the blame.

The <span class="hi">Corpes de gardes</span> and the Sentinels, be not sufficient, when a man hath to deale with an hardie Enemie, which willingly doth try fortune, and delights in actions of the night, the which when they be well conducted grow to meruailous issue.</p><p>Besides, the dilligence vsed in the placing of the bodies of the watch and Sentinels, I thinke it very requisite, there should bée sent foorth of the Cittie or Fortresse, eyght or tenne Horsemen, to skoure the way on that side that the Enemie might come to gyue the scalade and assault: for by this meanes you shall remaine as­sured, that there can nothing fall out, whereof you shall not be ad­uertised in due time to prepare your selfe for defence.

Therfore to auoyd such inconuenience, some haue vsed to blindfield the Enemies Drum and Trumpetter, with a scarfe, vpon his first comming to the Sentinell without the Gates, and frō thence to send a Sergiant or other trustie Officer with him, to the Gouernour, who accompanying hym vntill hys returne, may disband hys eyes, a Hargabuze shot from the walles.</p><p>I cannot héere passe ouer with silence, one note amongst other great trauels and toyles in warfare, which fals out in the defence of a Fortresse. In that sometimes a Prince or Generall wil com­maund thee to goe into a Towne or Castell, which before hande you know by effect, to be of small defence: wherefore considering it is a difficile thing, for a Souldiour of approoued experience, to yeeld account of hys honor, together with the losse of a Fortresse, many haue thought it good to refuse such a charge, by meanes whereof, they haue lost the good grace of theyr Prince, and haue béene diffamed of him &amp; of the people, and accounted as cowards and dastards. Wherefore in my iudgement, a Souldiour of ho­nour, ought rather to accept such a charge then to refuse it, yea, if it were to runne headlong into manifest danger, dooing his dutie neuerthelesse, with as great dilligence and valour as he can pos­sible.</p><p>It is good for all that, he giue his Prince or Generall to vn­derstand, that the same place is of no defence, neuerthelesse, to doo hym seruice, he is resolutly determined to hazard his life therein. Now if hys Chiefetaine be of discretion, as it is to be presupposed he is, and one that will not shewe himselfe ingratefull towardes his Souldiours, he wyll honour this Souldiour, and recompence hym for hys valour and loyaltie.</p><p>To come to the defence of a siege, I woulde first require the Chiefetaine, to reade my generall notes of fortification, wherin <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13157"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=167">[Page 311]</a></span> and in the other parts of this Booke, he shall finde many good ad­uertisements and obseruations.</p><p>Moreouer, let him aboue all things, victuall hys Fortresse well, for though it be otherwise inuinsible, yet for want of the same it may be lost: for a Towne beeing once besieged, it is hard to victuall the same, or to discharge it of improffitable mouthes, for the one is very hard &amp; vncertaine, the other doth profit smally, touching which, <span class="hi">Florence</span> and <span class="hi">Sienna</span> in the wars of <span class="hi">Italie</span> may be an example, who going about to vse this remedie, were in the end smally discharged. But alas, with what difficultie and incredible compassion did they obtaine the least part of theyr intent, a thing more miserable then is necessary to be rehearsed, &amp; therfore accor­ding to the place &amp; persons, requisite prouision ought in due time to be made, and to be kept in Storehouses for the siege time.</p><p>The number of Souldiours to defende a Fortresse, ought to be greater then those for the ordinary defence of the same when it is not besieged, to the intent there may be store to make sallies and issues: and besides, in the time of a siege many be destroyed and faile, eyther by sworde or sicknes. It is accounted most ne­cessary for the defence of a Cittie or Fortresse, to haue a thousand Souldiours for euery thousand pase, yea and a farre greater num­ber according to the bignesse of the Bulwarks and circuit of o­ther places.</p><p>When the Enemie hath enuironed the Towne, and begunne hys approches, it is requisite the Souldiours should likewise en­uiron the walles, and lodge and make theyr Cabbens at the foote of the Curtines and Ramparts, that according to theyr due ap­pointed Quarter, they may be ready vpon all occasions of seruice, keeping neuerthelesse, sufficient <span class="hi">Corpes de garde</span> in the Market­place, Towne-house, and other strength, to brydle the mutinous mindes of the Townes men.</p><p>Hée must with all dilligence, vse all possible meanes to garde and kéepe the Ditch, with the way which is made in the Coun­terscarpe, which commonly is called the couert way.

The entrie thereunto, must be by the Cannoniers of the Flancks, which defend y<sup>e</sup> same, which will serue to be of no small commodity to the Souldiours, hauing the meane to transport themselues easily and without danger, into all places where ne­cessitie dooth call them.</p><p>The Countergard must be sustained on that side towardes the Cittie, with a little wall, which must be of lesse height then the earth, by thrée or foure foote, to the intent you may easily discouer, (béeing before the Counterscarpe) fiue or sixe foote of the Wall, which dooth enclose and shut vp the Fortresse.</p><p>This earth must bee spred vniformally, and couched betwixt the two walles, according to the <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> before prescribed, to the in­tent that there may be nothing but it may discouer, and defende on all sides, and that no hinderaunce may be giuen to the Flankers and Caualiers to shoote and behold each place.</p><p>This proportion shal be very little able to be battered, and least before the Angles of the Bulwarks, and the midst of y<sup>e</sup> Curtines, by reason of their thicknesse; and if it should receiue any batterie, it should be onely but vpon the height and top of the same. And in the space betwixt the one wall and the other, certaine hearbes for the nourishment of Cattle may be sowne, amongst which, to ioyne the earth more fast together, it is good to sowe a certaine Hearbe, called <span class="hi">Medica,</span> for that it was brought from <span class="hi">Mede,</span> which dooth bring forth a very long roote, specially when the ground hath béene plowed and laboured much before, which will procure it to be able to be defended, against the iniurie of the ayre, and of men, neyther néedes it to be sowne but from ten yéeres to ten.

First it hydes and couers the sight of the foote of the wall: the Counterscarpe therof, doth prohibite the flankes or Cannonieres, which defende the bothome of the ditch, that they cannot be battered. The sayde ditch is frée and secrete, and doth greatly fauour the souldiours in a Fortresse, beeing enuironed with a Campe, for they may enter and issue, without receiuing any domage by the Enemy, during the siege. True it is that it may be the sooner fild vp, but that im­perfection may be succoured, neyther shal the same haue such force in the straite ditch, as in that which is so large and very broade, in the which the Souldiours béeing easily discouered, and not hauing any great libertie to make residence therein▪ without danger, they must alwaies stand vpon the garde of theyr persons. The which will not fall out, if they be within a more straite ditch, exempt from all feare: for béeing couered by the bancks of the ditch, they onelie haue nothing to doo, but to apply themselues to make frustrate the Enemies attempts. The which kind of defence, is one of the best that can be inuented for the besieged, and most endomageable to the assaylants. For the enemy entering resolutely into the Ditch, and marching forward to assault, hee must haue regarde to three sides, the one, to the Front, which is the body of the Fortresse, and the two other, to the souldiours which are within the ditch, and may offend the Enemy by the sides, and specially vpon the banck, if he presume to march farre forward, and to passe further on then the Counterscarpe.</p><p>Now to giue thys Ditch his competent largenes, to the intent it may accomplish these foresaid good qualities, it ought but to be 100. foote broade at the most, and in depth if it be plaine, but 18. or 20. foote, giuing to the wall of the Counterscarpe such a conue­nient enclyning, (as for 5. or 6. foote 1. foote,) to y<sup>e</sup> intent it may be strong, &amp; repulse the matter wherwith the Counterscarpe is to be filled. And for y<sup>e</sup> the Counterscarpe is one of y<sup>e</sup> most principal parts <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13888"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=176">[Page 328]</a></span> of the ditch, I will finally dilate somewhat therof, therby to make manifest the faults of Counterscarps now in vse.

Ouer whom, a Captaine ought to take no lesse care, then a father doth ouer his children, or a brother towards his bro­ther: or to speake more properly, a faithfull companion towards hys friend, in respect that hee ought to terme those that be his fol­lowers, and are guided by him, hys companions in Armes.</p><p>It is good the Generall make election of a fat &amp; fréendly Coun­try, which so néere as is possible is aboundant in all things, large, commodious, and of sound and open ayre, for the respect of gathe­ring together and making the Amasse of the people, and for y<sup>e</sup> con­ueiance of prouision for the Armie.

And so consequently, that the election of other Officers and Souldiours, depending vpon their choyse, be of good qualitie, as by all reason they ought to be, for we must perswade our selues, that, that num­ber is far lesse, which truely and exactly knowes, the importaunt and high secrets of the honourable arte of Armes, then those that are reputed meane and common. Therefore wise men affirme, that, that Prince, dooth most worthily merite the rule of a Monar­chie, that can make a good election of wise Counsellers and war­like Captaines.</p><p>After this, he must make choyse of a sufficient Comessarie Ge­nerall, who chéefely may haue charge, to giue carefull order, that all the people and Souldiours may be conducted, to the mayne A­masse and assembly, with speciall politique spéede, to the ende they may iourney without working domage to the Countrey where they passe: and that y<sup>e</sup> souldiours doo not fall to the spoile, through the ouer great pennury and want of necessary things.</p><p>Besides, thys great Comessary, obeyed by the particuler Pur­ueyours, béeing of accord with the Marshall of the Fielde: must vse his endeuour towards the prouision of ordinary victuals, that it may be well conducted, and better kept, sometimes if it be pos­sible renuing the same, specially in a Country that is aboundant, and distribute the old amongst the souldiours: but for al that, this must be doone, when as it cannot otherwise be spent or kept good, that he may drawe the money disbursed at the Officers and Col­lonels hands. Amongst these sufficient store of victuals, proui­ded by this Comessarie and his followers, I haue séene it thought very necessary, to conduct with the Armie, flockes and droues of beastes, great and small, the which is of little hinderance or impe­diment, because they are not of burden, and for that by themselues they may be kept in good disposition: and the rather béeing ayded by the Princes strong arme of authoritie.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14431"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=182">[Page 341]</a></span>This Comessary may vsually send out safe-gards or sealed Pa­tents, that there may be respect had vnto Townes and other pla­ces, aboundant in scraw, Corne, Meale, Beere, Wine, Oyle, Cattle, Powder, Flesh, Salt, Wood, Fruite, and such other neces­sary things, specially where such places be taken and comen vpon at vnawares by the Armie.</p><p>These commodities and Munitions, he must cause to be kept with good order, to the intent they may the longer serue, and with one of the Generals Trumpets, which may accompany the said safegards or patents, or with some small Troupes of souldiours, and nayle them vpon the gates of the Townes, Cattles, or hou­ses: these and the presence of the Trumpet, with a small ga<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>de of men of war, is of sufficient force to cause the said place to be re­spected so much as it ought or as is necessary: the which Office was very wel executed in the yéeres 1578. 1579. 1580. vn­der <span class="hi">Don Iohn</span> and the Prince of <span class="hi">Parma.</span></p><p>The Generall of the Armie, ought to examine often and verie narrowly the principall Officers, that good orders may alwaies with great diligence be executed, and cōtinually with circumspect care, alwaies kéepe open the vigilant eyes of the minde, and those of the body, warie and still waking, as well in aspecting occasion, as also in accepting and executing thē, with rare prouidence and valour.

For sometimes, either of peruerse purpose, or fainting hart, in suddaine assaults which at vnawares arise by meanes of the Enemie, and by the suddaine noyse of Allarmes, they doo flée away and saue themselues.

For as it is a thing most manifest and cleere, that hauing such as be good and faithful, the victory remaines as it were certaine, so the contrary dooth easily succeede, when his con­tinuall and wakefull eye hath not respect to these substantiall ad­uertisements.</p><p>Neyther can any Captaines execute or commaund with more assurance or better to the purpose, then those which are well con­ducted and led by Guides, and instructed so neere as is possible of all the Enemies determinations, and in what manner and forme he will worke by the intelligences of his Espyals. But hee must beware hee take carefull paynes to examine all things himselfe, without trusting to the indirect endeuor of any other person. And therfore it is a most necessary and excellent quality, to vnderstand and speake many languages by imitating that most famous and victorious Emperour <span class="hi">Charles</span> the fist, since that hee himselfe dyd vnderstand the speech of euery Nation accustomed to practise with him, and to the most part of them sententicusly and pithilie coulde aunswer: by reason that not onely for thys respect the beneuo­lence of diuers Nations and particuler persons is gained, which is a thing that much imports, but also moreouer deceite is auoi­ded, which through the defect and naturall vice of diuers malig­nent Interpreters might ensue: wherefore it is euer good to be doubtful.</p><p>Hée must of necessitie haue with him, such persons as be professed in Souldiours <span class="hi">Architecture,</span> for the most part properlie called by the name of Ingeniors, who must haue knowledge to cause and cast out the proportion of Trenches, to make them of sufficient defence, and to frame massiue Bulwarks, large and re­all Ditches, Gabions radled round about, to forme great Para­pets, and not onely to be good inuentors with iust proportions, but also more studious of the plots and formes, and those things that be therunto correspondent, and how to accomodate himselfe to the reasonable situation which is to be fortefied: and y<sup>e</sup> in effect they haue greater knowledge in warlike then in domesticall <span class="hi">Archi­tecture,</span> of which I haue in a particuler discourse intreated in my fist Booke.</p><p>Likwise it is very good, he take delight chiefly in cases of suspect (although he haue lodged his Armie, in a place that is of a good &amp; strong situation) to compasse the most weake places thereof, with <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14512"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=183">[Page 343]</a></span> ditches &amp; Trenches of good proportion, &amp; reasonable wel flancked.

The which through this great worke of Trenches, and together with many Carres planted vppon the one side, and vppon the other the great Riuer <span class="hi">Danubie,</span> and in front with certaine Pondes and Ditches of wa­ter, and vpon the backe, the town of <span class="hi">Inglistate,</span> it was altogether compassed and enuironed of sufficient force. But touching these respects, looke in my fourth booke, where I haue particularly tou­ched this matter.</p><p>Moreouer, it is necessary that the Captayne Generall, doe sometimes ryde by night about the Campe, and admonish the watch that they remaine ready and vigilant, since that in the eies and eares of so fewe, the health &amp; sauegarde of all the Campe doth consist. As little as may be, he must suffer alarums to be gy­uen to his people, either by daye or by night, or at any tyme whatsoeuer: but if thereunto hee bee constrayned, lette him make it secretly, and without striking vp the Drums, or sounding Trompets, but rather vse Drum stickes and Surdines. Or o­therwise in respect and place of those Instruments, which in such <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14560"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=184">[Page 344]</a></span> cases are accustomed to be sounded. It is very conuenient he send some persons of authority, of purpose therunto appoynted, to passe round about and through the Campe, to aduertise &amp; appoint spée­dily, such thinges as are to be performed, hauing before hand, had perfect discouerie of the enimie, and giuen resolute commission to make the alarum. Which quiet kinde of procéeding, shall after­wards cause lesse traueyle, and much more reputation to his peo­ple and to himselfe: and to his enemy great confusion and discon­ragement, perceiuing that by their pollitike and valiant procée­ding, they do smally estéeme or feare them. Which at sundrie a­larums in the Campe, surprises of Townes, Camisadoes, &amp;c. I haue in the low Countries, vnder <span class="hi">Don Iohn,</span> seene pollitikely put in practise.</p><p>Hee ought when any alarum shall chaunce to bee gyuen, to take order with the high Marshall, with as great dilligence as he <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>anne, to double the <span class="hi">Corps de garde</span> and watch: which ought be­fore hande to be placed with great Iudgement, in places that bée strong by nature, or otherwise fortefied by arte. Besides, he must carry a speciall care, and vse a singuler dilligence, not to giue occa­sion of Mutinies, the which are accustomed for the most parte, to bring foorth extreame ruine: chiefly when they bee of naughtie nature, although the dignitie, authority, and power of the Cap­tayne Generall bee very great, for there is almost neuer any remedy vsed agaynst such vprores, without great losse of reputa­tion and authority, so great is the terrible furie of this franticke encounter.</p><p>He neuer ought to suffer his Collonelles, neither his Cap­taines, to haue any dead payes, or supply their roomes by others, that passe vnder their names in Muster: for in time of important neede, many times the Captayne Generall, shal finde his Forces very much weakened, contrarie to his expectation. A thing verie daungerous for the totall ruine of the whole Armie. Together with this aduertisement, hee ought to be alwayes courteous and liberall towards those that do follow him, to the intent his Chief­taine may courteously entertayne those that be good Souldiours. A thing worthy to be noted.</p><p>He must search by all meanes possible, to kéepe his Armie continually, couragions and wyth aspiring mindes, by arteficiall functions, to the enemies confusion. Sometimes dispearsing a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14605"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=184">[Page 345]</a></span> rumor, that hee hath intercepted and taken, certayne aduertise­ments of importance. Somtimes to <span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>aigne, that he hath the com­moditie to ayde himselfe, with the succours of many Princes and cōmon Princes, although there be no such matter. To make ioy­full Triumphes and shewes with Artillarie, arteficial fyres and bondfyres, in the euenings, and sometimes making shew that he hath a desire to assault and inuade the enemy by night, by Cami­sado, they beeing vnprouided: as did <span class="hi">Charles</span> the fift against the <span class="hi">Lantzgraue,</span> vppon the arriuall of <span class="hi">Counte de Bure</span> with succours out of Flaunders: or as did <span class="hi">Iulian Romero,</span> vnder the Duke of <span class="hi">Al­ua,</span> when the Prince of <span class="hi">Orange</span> was repulsed from before <span class="hi">Moun­tes in he nault.</span></p><p>Besides this, hee may vse like functions, artes, or Strata­gemes, to aduance his warlike affayres: for, it is a vertue to vse deceit in Militarie actions, thereby to further the procéedings of iustice, against manifest enemies, when it is lawfull to assault, ei­ther with crafte or force, either openly or couertly, for that which doth succéede, whether it fall out by deceit or valour, is comenda­ble in warlike actions. As did <span class="hi">Don Iohn,</span> in suprising the Castell of <span class="hi">Namures,</span> a thing which fell out to be the safty of himselfe &amp; the whole Countrey, and the cause whereby hee had meanes to re­uenge himselfe of his enemies, at such times as we gaue thē that famous ouerthrow, betwixt <span class="hi">Namures</span> and <span class="hi">Gibloe.</span></p><p>Let the Generall haue great care to such chaunces and acci­dents, as haue néed of present remedy, repayring them with care­full prouidence, by reason that the most occasions which fal out in wars, can suffer no delayes: for whilst some haue béene in consul­ting, and deferring the matter but a little moment of time, they haue at that instant receiued losse not able to be recouered, &amp; ther­fore to proceede with a wise and spéedie policie, is of infinite ad­uantage, yea and altogether necessary. He must alwayes haue in memory, y<sup>e</sup> not by reason he is Superior, in number &amp; multitude of souldiours, he may make assured account of victory: but rather through the good order he doth obserue, in disposing &amp; framing a ready obedience, and the exercise of a true &amp; approued practise in warlike actions, is the only meanes to performe the same, &amp; dooth cause the difference thorowly to bee discerned, betwixt one Cap­taine Generall and an other. For the art of Militarie profession dooth nourish in the breastes of men which follow this exercise, a valiant and aspiring mind to fight. Therfore as from thence safty <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14693"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=185">[Page 346]</a></span> and victory doth procéede: so contrariwise, by not possessing the same, losse and totall ruine doth follow: Since that practise, doth make a man abound with exquisite qualities, whereby courage is kindled in our harts: and contrariwise quenched in him that is a Nouice and fresh water souldier, in the exercise of these causes, which in euery respect is grounded vppon long experience, confe­rence and reading, and not by proud and presumptuous rashnes.</p><p>He must likewise remember, that many times in new begun wars, specially against straunge nations, a new forme of fight is requisite. The election of new armes is necessary, the varying of order, &amp; the studie of a new art. Likewise it is good to Campe and discampe often, when it may be done without manifest perill, and without suspicion or daunger of the enemy: for thereby the infec­tion of the ayre is auoided, and souldiours kéept exercised, who by lying still become flouthfull and negligent. Moreouer, the Mar­shal of the field hauing at euery lodging, either planted or entren­ched the Campe: it is most necessary for the Generall, beeing accompanyed with some <span class="hi">Caualieres</span> of his owne Courte and guarde, hauing before hym hys generall Trumpet, and his Guidon or Cornet displayde (without which hee ought ne­uer to goe abroade) to ride vp and downe to visite the quarters, places of armes, Munitions, and Trenches. And to the intent he may kéepe the Souldiours in their Lodgings, and in their proper quarters, when it is expedient that they should not wander about the armie, for some good and speciall purpose. Let him cause some small stampe or countersigne to be giuen or dis<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>rsed to y<sup>e</sup> Cap­taynes, to the end, that they gyuing them to the Officers or soul­diours, they may accomplish all theyr necessary businesse, without being hindered or stayed of the prouost: who must carry a vigi­lant respect, touching this charg, so that those which haue not such countersignes or stampes, and bee founde foorth of their quarter, may be chastised without remission, according to the proclama­tion and bande, made to that effect.</p><p>When the Generall cannot in time, readily paye his Soul­diours, as many times it falles out through want of money, or by reason of some other accident, it is néedefull for him to make pro­uision, that the Countrey where he remaynes may beare them: or els let him carrie them into a barraine place, smally inhabited, to the intent, that not béeing able to liue but with great spare, through the want of many delicate thinges, they may bee more patient in attending theyr paie.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14734"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=185">[Page 347]</a></span>He must permit, that the baggage of all sort of people, the victu­als, the Munitions, with the other impediments, and finally al the disarmed, may haue a seueral Captaine, Chiefe, &amp; Ensigne, euery one apart, if their number will beare the same, for that they must march vnited together, and in order, as shal be most expedient and conuenient, to the intent they doo not cause great disturbance and confusion, through their s<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>oe or ouer-hasty going, which is an or­dinary thing amongst them, béeing vnruly people.</p><p>Let the Generall, as before I saide, carry a speciall care to the choyse of his principall Officers, and that in the election, he haue more respect to the valour &amp; vertue of the person, then to any parti­culer fauour, otherwise he may in time be brought to repent hys choise, and hardly redresse his calamities▪ Therfore let him often and vnlooked for, resort vnto the Captaines &amp; Collonels Tents, to sée what towardly readines they are or may bee in of a suddaine, and that he cause the Captaines make often like resort vnto the souldiours and vnder Officers, to sée if they be in the like orderlie readines for any suddaine seruice: and by degrées discending frō one to another, to make speciall proofe of euery mans sufficiencie. For y<sup>e</sup> better performance wherof, he must receiue into his hands, the order of all Offices in writing, together with all the names of the souldiours in the Band, wherby he may likewise sée whether he haue his iust number. And consequently examine euery Offi­cer, whether they haue a sufficient proportion of Armour, wea­pon, shot, powder, artillary, fireworks, boates to make bridges to passe Riuers, spades, mattocks, and euery other particularity, be­fore the Armie march.</p><p>The Generall hauing receiued his whole Armie entirely, hee must assemble his Counsell, and to ordaine stai<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>ts and lawes for the gouernment of his souldiours, first communicating the same with his Collonels and Captaines, causing them also to impart them to their Bands, suffering euery man franckly with due re­uerence to speake, obiect, and by writing (if they list) to offer vnto the Counsell what they can against any of them, which obiections considered, they shal resolue vpon such like Lawes &amp; Penalties as I haue adioyned to the dutie of a souldiour in my first Booke, be­ginning alwaies with Lawes for the feare of God, and the Chri­stian faith, and so follow on for the Prince, Country, and Campe. And then cause euery Collonel and Captaine to take his oath, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14776"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=186">[Page 348]</a></span> they likewise to cause euery souldiour at his Ensigne to take hys oath, to obserue, and as much as in them shall lye, to cause to be obserued euery of those lawes and Edicts so agréed vpon.</p><p>He must not onely cause the foresaid lawes to be written or im­printed in seuerall Bookes, giuen to the Collonels, Captaines, o­ther Officers and Corporals therby to instruct euery priuate soul­diour perfectly in thē, but also to prouide, that the Prouost Gene­ral doo prosecute y<sup>e</sup> offenders &amp; breakers of these Edicts, who with his followers must be specially respected, as before is set downe.</p><p>The General is by good, speciall and perfit plots, Maps, &amp; Mo­dels, to know the situation, nature, and property of the Country, and his parts where he is to passe with his Armie, whether it be plaine &amp; champion, or woody &amp; ful of waters, furnished with strong Townes, or no: and to proportion the Horsemen and Footmen of his Army accordingly. For if it be most part champion and full of forrage, it is meet to haue the more Horsemen: if it stand vppon straits and fortefyed places, he is to haue the more Footmen.</p><p>Light Horsmen are in all places for discouery, fetching in of boo­ties, &amp; pursuing of victory, very seruiceable, and not to be spared.</p><p>The General ought also to learne by good espial how his enemy is appointed: for against the French, who abound with shot, and haue few pikes, the Launce &amp; Light-horsmans staffe of the North is singuler good, especially in the plaine: but against the <span class="hi">Switzers</span> and <span class="hi">Launce Knights,</span> the Launce auaileth litle, but y<sup>e</sup> <span class="hi">Argoleteares</span> and <span class="hi">Pistoleteares</span> shall much more anoy them. It shal be likewise very cōmodious to haue some cariages allowed in pay, to attende on euery Band of footmen, as wel as on horsmen, who besides the carriage of necessaries for vse, may also in time of Skirmish, and other encounters, serue to carry hurt men out of the field. They be very good to empale the Armie, specially if the cartages &amp; horses bee arteficially flancked and shadowed with boordes filled wyth quires of paper.</p><p>Whilst faire wether is, the Generall must acquaint hys Soul­diours to sleepe on bare ground, and though the Enemy be far ab­sent, yet duly to maintaine their Scoutes to watch and ward, and performe all Millitary orders, as curiously as if the Enemy were present, so shall it not séeme gréeuous when necessity requires it.</p><p>If he haue many horse, he must sée that the Marshall of the field plant his Campe, where good store of forrage is néere, otherwise, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14833"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=186">[Page 349]</a></span> in forraging farre off, he may greatly hazard his companies, if good Conuoyes be not sent with his Forragers, and their iourneyes dis­creetly directed. Good regard must also be had, that the Camp be not subiect to any hill, from whence the enemy may beate with great Ar­tillary, nor so disioyned frō water, as the enemie may easily cut you from it, neither yet so low, as the Enemy cutting the bancks of anie Riuer, may drowne the Campe.

Then let them bend the Artillary that waie where most suspicion is the enemy shall approch, and if time wil per­mit, to cast some Trench also without the carriages against Artilla­rie.

And so to consider whether y<sup>e</sup> enemy may conueniently cut off his victuals, or by Ambush anoy him in his march, and for preuen­tion therof, to send abroad Light-horsemen &amp; Hargabuzers to garde the passages towards the enemies Garisons. Before the Armie dis­campe, all passages and waies for the souldiours and Artillary. &amp;c. to passe; should be discouered, and skilful men appointed to lead them.</p><p>He ought not to suffer any band to march scattered, but in battails order, or at least in straits &amp; narrow passages inforce to drawe them forth in Herses, and so soone as place serueth, to reduce them again in­to the order of battaile: and this is to be vsed in places of security for exercise, as in places of suspect for safetie. He ought to haue with him good Guides, that perfecty know all passages, hilles, vallies, &amp;c. for of the Country in generallitie, the Generall himselfe ought perfectly to be informed by Plots &amp; Models, wherby he shal the better conceiue any information that shal be brought him by espiall. If the General haue sundry Nations vnder his gouernment, it is not méete to gyue alwaies to any one Nation the Uaward, considering the same, being in marching towards the enemy the place of greatest honour, the o­thers will much repine against it, and not without good cause. The order therfore in marching, should so be framed, that euery Nation haue his turne, without partial fauor to any one. And if the number be great of any one Mercinary Nation, it is not amisse to deuide thē, both in marching &amp; imbattelling, for sundry respects, which in thys place I omit to show. If any strait be kept by the enemie, it is not méet first to charge them vpon the very front, but to send Light-hors­men &amp; shot to skyrmish with them on either flancke, and then wyth Targets of proofe to enter vpon them.</p><p>The Generall shold before he bring his Souldiours to deale with the enemy, first in some champion place, cause them to be ranged in forme of battaile, making of his footmen sundry <span class="hi">Battillions,</span> &amp; of these <span class="hi">Battillions,</span> sundry <span class="hi">Fronts,</span> to deuide his Horsemen also into sundry <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14930"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=187">[Page 351]</a></span> Troupes, placing the men at Armes, Demilances, Light horsemen, and <span class="hi">Argoleteares</span> euery Fort in seueral Troupes by themselues, to cause the forlorne to issue out, and skirmish thē before the <span class="hi">Battillions,</span> as if the enemy were indéed present, and vpon a signe giuen, suddain­ly to retire.

These things, if in pastime the souldiours be able orderly to performe, there is good hope they wil honorably put it in execution vpon the enemy.

Note that it is much better to ouercome the enemy, by weari­ing him with delaies, then by furious fight put himselfe to y<sup>e</sup> hazarde of doubtful fortune, which oftentimes hath in battaile greater puis­sance <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e15007"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6010&amp;page=188">[Page 352]</a></span> then valour or vertue it selfe, therefore alway procéede in these vncertaine ends of Armes, rather assuredly then perrillously.

In warres, for the most part, the victory comes by nothing els, but the euill counsell and base mind of his aduersary, therefore very hardly can he be ouercome, that can measure and knowe, both hys owne, and his enemies forces and order.</p><p>When a Prince or his Generall, hath fortefyed himselfe wyth Confederates, with good and experienced Captaines wyth valiant Souldiours, with Municion and weapons, with money and strong places: it followes that he endeuours himselfe to weaken the force, interrupt and breake in sunder the aduersaries determinations, the which thing may be performed spéedily or late, according as occasion shall offer it selfe, which is the fountaine and originall of all graci­ous acts.</p><p>To conclude, the Generall, the high Officers of the Army, Colo­nels, Captaines, and Souldiours, must daily serue God, for Religi­on causeth good orders, good orders brings good fortune, good fortune makes good successe to arise in all enterprises. The Armie wel paide, discipline must be vsed without respect of persons. Iustice to doo eue­ry man right, makes the Generall of great maiestie and reputati­on, beloued and feared, because hee dooth and is able to aduaunce the vertuous, and correct the wicked. For money is the flesh &amp; sinewes of the warres, and ordeined for the same.
