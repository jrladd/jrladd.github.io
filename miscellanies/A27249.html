For his firſt Clauſe, of conſulting with <span class="hi">able Lawyers,</span> and receiving their Judgement <span class="hi">in favour</span> of his <span class="hi">De­ſign;</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> thinks he hath ſufficiently anſwered that already; that one Story may be good till another be heard, that <span class="hi">he</span> hath alſo the Judgement of very <span class="hi">able Lawyers againſt</span> the <span class="hi">Deſign,</span> and that if Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> himſelf were fairly and fully to ſtate the Caſe to thoſe very Gentlemen named by Mr. <span class="hi">Poole,</span> he nothing doubts but, upon a clear ſight of the Pretenſions and Grounds on both ſides, they would be ready to entertain favourable thoughts to his Right in the Buſineſs controverted.</p><p>2. For Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Offer to refer all to <span class="hi">Arbitration,</span> &amp;c. and Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Refuſall; Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> has confeſſed it, and given a Reaſon for it ſufficiently good to ſatisfie any Rational man. For the <span class="hi">grand Abſurdity</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is guilty of, neither Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> nor any body elſe can tell where it lies. Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies, It was not to be referr'd whether the <span class="hi">CRITICI SACRI</span> were Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s; but what Right Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> had in Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s <span class="hi">Collections</span> out of <span class="hi">them</span> and <span class="hi">many others.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> anſwers, that Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s <span class="hi">Collections</span> out of the CRITICKS were Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s juſt Right, as being his <span class="hi">Authours in part;</span> and for his <span class="hi">many others,</span> they could be no ground of any <span class="hi">Reference,</span> ſince he never laid Claim to them, nor had any thing to ſay to them. So that Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">Authours in part</span> (which Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> calls his <span class="hi">Collections</span>) were the thing to be <span class="hi">referr'd,</span> whether they were Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s or Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Right. And where now lies the <span class="hi">Abſurdity?</span> Whereas Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies he offered an <span class="hi">Equivalent,</span> a greater proportion of <span class="hi">Materials,</span> and I know not how much <span class="hi">Care</span> and <span class="hi">Pains</span> in <span class="hi">contriving</span> and <span class="hi">digeſting</span> the <span class="hi">whole:</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> anſwers; for his <span class="hi">Pains</span> he may thank himſelf, if he would be buſier then he needed, and run his Plow into another man's Ground upon his own head. What his <span class="hi">Care</span> was, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> knows not; but when Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> ſhall have knock'd off Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s fingers from meddling at all with his CRITICKS, and Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſhall have given his <span class="hi">Subſcribers</span> two or three more ſuch <span class="hi">Slurrs</span> as he has done by quitting the <span class="hi">Biblia Maxima,</span> one of his beſt <span class="hi">Materials,</span> which he formerly promiſed to bring in, but <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ow declares he will let alone, (ſo that they know not what they pay their Money for) Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> thinks by that time he may have his <span class="hi">Labour for his Care and Pains.</span> For the reſt of his <span class="hi">Materials</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> knows not what they are: but were they of never ſo much worth and credit, when Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> ſaies he'll have nothing to doe with them, and Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s other <span class="hi">colle­ctions</span> are his own already, how can Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> or any man elſe look upon this as an <span class="hi">Equivalent?</span> So that Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> goes on to declare, that Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> may as well religiouſly <span class="hi">Epitomize</span> his <span class="hi">Purſe</span> upon the High-way, as goe about by theſe crooked and ſiniſter Artifices to extort his unqueſtionable Right out of his hands, and all (as he pre­tends) for the <span class="hi">Glory of God.</span> That Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> never <span class="hi">choſe</span> above <span class="hi">one</span> perſon to any <span class="hi">Meeting,</span> and <span class="hi">that one</span> declar'd himſelf unſatisfied with Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Profer, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> again affirms. And whereas Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> threatens never to offer the like Terms again; Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> cannot help it, but deſires Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> not to trouble his head about that, till ſuch time as he ſhall ſend to him, and beg ſuch a Favour of him.</p><p>3. For Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">Ʋnrighteouſneſs,</span> and his bringing down the <span class="hi">Prices</span> of Books to the loſs and prejudice of many Scholars, (if there be <span class="hi">any</span> ſo prejudiced) there needs no new Anſwer. But whereas Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies, If theſe Loſſes and Injuries be expiated by the Serviceableneſs of Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Deſign to the publick good, why may not he have the benefit of the ſame Plea? Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> anſwers, Becauſe Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> has not that true and juſt <span class="hi">Title</span> to the Copies he pretends to as himſelf had. For Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> meddled with no Authours that any <span class="hi">Engliſh­man</span> could claim a Right in, without firſt making them <span class="hi">Satisfaction:</span> But Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> declares to take his princi­pal Materials out of thoſe Authours that Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> has made himſelf a Legal Title in, and that without his <span class="hi">Leave</span> or <span class="hi">Conſent,</span> or any <span class="hi">Conſideration</span> for them. Let Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> but keep his own ground, and not treſpaſs upon the CRITICKS, and let his <span class="hi">Epitomizing</span> bring down the <span class="hi">prices</span> of what Authours he will.</p><p>4. To his fourth Clauſe, (which is moſt of it <span class="hi">Crambe</span>) concerning one man's <span class="hi">Epitomizing</span> anothe<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> Copy without being <span class="hi">queſtion'd</span> for it, (as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies) Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> gives his former Anſwer, That Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> will find no Book in <span class="hi">England,</span> of one ſort or other, (before the <span class="hi">Parliament</span> 1642) printed either <span class="hi">in whole</span> or <span class="hi">part,</span> but either by the right <span class="hi">Owner,</span> or with his <span class="hi">Conſent</span> and <span class="hi">Approbation;</span> and the like in any forein <span class="hi">ſettled</span> Kingdome, State, or Principality. What things have been <span class="hi">here</span> ſince done to the contrary, have been done beſide Law <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e691"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98363&amp;page=2">[Page 2]</a></span> and Reaſon. And if ſome men in thoſe <span class="hi">Arbitrary</span> and <span class="hi">Licencious</span> times have not been able to help themſelves againſt <span class="hi">Ʋſurpers,</span> their caſe was to be <span class="hi">pitied,</span> rather then drawn into <span class="hi">Example.</span> But if any true Proprietors will in <span class="hi">theſe daies</span> either wink at other men while they pick their Pockets, or be negligent of their own Intereſts, when they have the Law open to defend and juſtifie them, or think it not worth their while to <span class="hi">ſue a Beggar and catch Vermine,</span> or it may be have taken <span class="hi">Compoſition</span> under-hand, (all which are at leaſt <span class="hi">tacit Conſents</span>) why ſhould this ſway any thing with Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> who never made over the leaſt of his Right, nor any way allow'd another to meddle with it, but is reſolved (by God's aſſiſtence) to try what the Law will doe for him, which as it is the great <span class="hi">Diſcerner,</span> ſo the <span class="hi">Securer</span> of all mens <span class="hi">Proprieties?</span> For <span class="hi">Marlorat</span>'s <span class="hi">Epitome,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> again averrs, that it was printed at the Charge of the ſame Bookſellers that had the Propriety in the Authours he <span class="hi">Epitomized,</span> and printed by the very ſame Printer. Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies, he that looks on the Title-pages of thoſe Authours will find this a mere <span class="hi">Fiction</span> of Mr. <span class="hi">Bee.</span> But let Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> look on the Title-pages of the <span class="hi">firſt Im­preſſions</span> of thoſe Authours, (not thoſe <span class="hi">after-Impreſſions</span> in other Countries which lay out of the bounds of their <span class="hi">Privileges,</span> and could no way be prevented, as Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> cannot prevent a Diſcourteſie of that nature to him­ſelf in Forein parts, and therefore had need to be ſecured by his <span class="hi">Grant</span> at home) Let Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> look on theſe, and he will ſoon find Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Tale true, and the <span class="hi">Fiction</span> to lie at his own door. By that time Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> has ſerved an <span class="hi">Apprenticeſhip</span> to the Trade (as every Bookſeller ſhould) he will learn to make this diſtinction: but at preſent he is but <span class="hi">raw</span> and <span class="hi">green</span> in the way. That the <span class="hi">Law-Patent-Caſe</span> was determined by the Lord <span class="hi">Keeper</span> the <span class="hi">laſt Term,</span> (by which Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> muſt mean <span class="hi">Hilary Term,</span> for this is but the ſame <span class="hi">Ʋntruth</span> repeated, which he formerly printed in his firſt <span class="hi">Paper</span> a little after <span class="hi">that Term</span>) Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> wonders with what face Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> can perſiſt in ſo groſs and palpable a <span class="hi">Falſity;</span> when 'tis notoriouſly known that in that <span class="hi">laſt</span> Term (as he calls it) there was nothing like a <span class="hi">Determination,</span> but it was onely <span class="hi">referr'd</span> to a future Hearing the enſuing <span class="hi">Eaſter term,</span> that in that <span class="hi">Term</span> it was again heard, and again put off, and at this preſent <span class="hi">Term</span> continues undecided. This all the Town can tell him. Now what <span class="hi">eminent Lawyer</span> it was that ſhould ſo abuſe Mr. <span class="hi">Poole,</span> (if Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> does not rather abuſe his <span class="hi">Lawyer</span>) as to aſſure him he was preſent, and heard the Lord <span class="hi">Keeper determine</span> the Caſe, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> cannot imagine, but takes the whole Story for a <span class="hi">Caſtle</span> built <span class="hi">in the Air</span> of Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Fancy, as moſt of what he ſaies beſides ſeems to have had its firſt hatching and production there.</p><p>5. Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies, he does not pretend to <span class="hi">Epitomize</span> the <span class="hi">whole</span> CRITICKS. Nor does Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> know how it can be done: for can a man <span class="hi">Epitomize,</span> and yet take the <span class="hi">whole?</span> can he take but <span class="hi">parts</span> of a thing, and yet have <span class="hi">all?</span> However (as Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> ſaid formerly) he takes all that he judges the <span class="hi">beſt,</span> and makes moſt for his purpoſe; he takes the <span class="hi">Kernell,</span> and leaves the <span class="hi">Shell</span> to Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> for his <span class="hi">Fifteen thouſand pound.</span> No, ſaies Mr. <span class="hi">Poole,</span> there are many material things in them not belonging to <span class="hi">Expoſition of Scripture,</span> which are valu­able another way. But what if Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſhould fall upon another <span class="hi">Deſign</span> hereafter, and then Collect out of them all that he now leaves behind, by the ſame Law and Reaſon that he now thinks to run away with ſo conſiderable a part of them? Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> remembers the Apologue of the old <span class="hi">Fox</span> and the young one. A ſorry <span class="hi">Fox Epitomized</span> a Flock of <span class="hi">Geeſe,</span> and brought home a couple of the <span class="hi">fatteſt.</span> The young ones laugh'd. At dinner ſaies one of them, Mother, they are excellent meat; but why did you bring no more of them? Peace, you fool, ſaies the old one, I have brought you home two of the <span class="hi">beſt,</span> and when occaſion ſerves I know where to find <span class="hi">the reſt</span> of them. So that Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> has no Security for the Remainder, and all that he has to thank Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> for is, his <span class="hi">Reprieving</span> the reſidue of his CRITICKS till his <span class="hi">Luſt</span> and <span class="hi">Stomach</span> be as ready for them as his <span class="hi">Conſci­ence</span> is.</p><p>6. His laſt Clauſe divides the Hoof, ſplits into two parts, and behold there come forth <span class="hi">Twins.</span> The firſt part conſiſts of <span class="hi">a Tale of a Tub,</span> the ſecond, <span class="hi">with the Bottom out.</span></p><p>To the firſt Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> ſaies, that he underſtands not what Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> means, when he ſaies his Deſign can be no Loſs of any preſent or certain Benefit to Mr. <span class="hi">Bee.</span> 'Tis true, what is <span class="hi">certain</span> and <span class="hi">preſent</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is ſure of. But this is certain at preſent, that the noiſe of Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Project (with divers that did not well underſtand the true ſtate of Buſineſſes) has done him ſome manifeſt Diſſervice abroad, which Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> muſt bear as well as he can. And whereas Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> is ſo raſhly confident as to publiſh in print now a <span class="hi">ſecond time </span> that ſeveral of Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">Partners</span> declare they will not joyn with him in a <span class="hi">ſecond Impreſſion:</span> why ſhould they <span class="hi">declare</span> ſo, when Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> had never <span class="hi">propoſed</span> the thing to them? But to ſtop Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s mouth for this matter, and to ſpoil his game here, let him but reade the following few words as they <span class="hi">voluntarily</span> came from Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">Partners</span> (now living) ſubſcribed with their own hands.</p><div class="q">We declare that we never refuſed to joyn with Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> in re-printing the <span class="hi">CRITICKS,</span> as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> falſely chargeth us in his Paper. <ul><li class="item">Richard Royſton.</li><li class="item">William Wells.</li><li class="item">Sam.

And yet they are groſsly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1145"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98363&amp;page=2">[Page 3]</a></span> wide in their Gueſſes, which are directly beſides Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Reſolution, (if God permit) to go on as <span class="hi">vigorouſly</span> as Mr.<span class="hi">Poole,</span> according to the <span class="hi">Pattern</span> exhibited to the World in his late <span class="hi">Specimen.</span> But Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſays this Undertaking of Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> is a work of time, charge, and uncertainty. For the <span class="hi">Ʋncertainty,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Deſign is equally ſubject to it; and more uncertain in this reſpect, that the <span class="hi">Epitomizer</span> himſelf ſeems to be ſo <span class="hi">uncertain,</span> as not yet to be well reſolved what to take in to his <span class="hi">Doing,</span> and what to leave out; whereas Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s whole <span class="hi">Deſign</span> is completed and digeſted. For Accidents and Caſualties they are common to both. For the <span class="hi">Charge</span> of it, let it not trouble Mr.<span class="hi">Poole,</span> it ſhall never coſt him a farthing. For the <span class="hi">Time,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> hopes to carry it on with that convenient expedition, that poſſibly it may prevent Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s, and make a <span class="hi">younger Brother</span> of it, if it do not in the meanwhile prove <span class="hi">Abortive,</span> or ſtifled in the Wombe. And whereas Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſays he has a <span class="hi">Privilege</span> as well as Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> and bears himſelf high upon that: Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> wonders upon the account of what <span class="hi">Merit</span> he procured it. But how-ever, he hopes Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> will conſider he is his <span class="hi">ſenior</span> in <span class="hi">Privilege</span> eight years, and that the Scene lies not in <span class="hi">Kent,</span> but in <span class="hi">Middleſex,</span> where <span class="hi">Gavel-kind</span>-Law has no footing, but the <span class="hi">Elder</span> has the advantage and priority of the reſt, that is, the <span class="hi">Privilege.</span> Both Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> and Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> can't have Right to the Eſtate. But if Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">Privilege</span> will not hold water, and ſecure him from any attempt Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> can make upon his Propriety, what does Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> think will become of his, if any man ſhould go about in a <span class="hi">mad</span> humour to <span class="hi">Epitomize</span> part or <span class="hi">whole</span> (as he phraſes it) of his <span class="hi">Deſign?</span> If Mr. <span class="hi">Bee's Privilege</span> will doe no good, why ſhould Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> trouble himſelf to procure one, which may as well be undermined by another, and that by a third, and ſo Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> be reduced to the ſame condition as he endeavours to bring Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> into, ſmart by his own Rod, and be gull'd of his <span class="hi">pretended</span> Right after his own Example?</p><p>To the ſecond part; Whereas Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> inſtances in ſeveral Authours <span class="hi">Epitomized,</span> as <span class="hi">Baronius, Raleigh,</span> &amp;c. which yet bear good rates in the World, and therefore Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Clamours are groundleſs, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> an­ſwers, that there are <span class="hi">Epitomes</span> which have been undertaken with ſo little diſcretion and judgement in the Ma­nagery, that the Undertakers have been <span class="hi">laugh'd at</span> and <span class="hi">hiſs'd off the Stage:</span> and no wonder if thoſe Authours at large have kept their Advantage. But for others, <span class="hi">Baronius</span> for one, they have been manifeſtly obſtructed in their <span class="hi">ſales</span> and <span class="hi">rates,</span> ſays the <span class="hi">old Book-ſeller,</span> what-ever Mr.<span class="hi">Poole,</span> (who is yet but a <span class="hi">Pretender</span> to the Trade) may ſay to the contrary. But is there any Authour ſo <span class="hi">martyred</span> as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> threatens to ſerve Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span>'s, and yet <span class="hi">lives?</span> He pretends to <span class="hi">drain</span> and <span class="hi">ſuck</span> all the <span class="hi">marrow</span> and <span class="hi">heart-bloud</span> out of the CRITICKS, all that tends any way to the <span class="hi">underſtanding of difficult places of Scripture,</span> which is the whole <span class="hi">Deſign</span> and <span class="hi">Life</span> of Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span>'s nine Volumes? Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> ſays, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> did formerly declare that ſuch a <span class="hi">synopſis</span> as Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s would not prejudice his Work. If Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> means the <span class="hi">Synopſis</span> as he has now contriv'd it, to conſiſt two Vo­lumes in three out of his Work, there's no man can believe Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> ſo <span class="hi">ſenſleſs</span> as to expreſs himſelf to any ſuch purpoſe. All that he ſaid was, if Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> meddled not with his CRITICKS, or if his Deſign were as he firſt repreſented it to Mr.<span class="hi">Bee,</span> it would not be ſo prejudicial: but ſince he has declared to take one <span class="hi">whole Volume,</span> and another time no leſs then <span class="hi">two,</span> out of them, the caſe is alter'd, and Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> muſt not be underſtood to de­clare a thing ſo manifeſtly tending to his own ruine. Whereas Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> twits Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> with his conceit of <span class="hi">ima­ginary Profit</span> which may accrue to him, does not Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> expect the like in his Undertaking? and what may Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> think of <span class="hi">him,</span> who has the <span class="hi">real profit</span> and advantage of his <span class="hi">subſcription-money</span> for ſome moneths at leaſt, if his Deſign goes no farther on?</p><p>Having gone thus far, Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> propoſes two ſmart Caſes, which if Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> thought it worth the while he would anſwer. To the firſt of them he ſays onely this, That if Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> will bring his <span class="hi">imaginary</span> Reve­rend and Learned <span class="hi">Doctour</span> out of the <span class="hi">Clouds,</span> where he ſuppoſes him to live, and procure a Meeting betwixt Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> and him, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> will give him a ſatisfactory Anſwer to the wild <span class="hi">Quere</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> makes on his be­half, (whether he may not print a <span class="hi">Collection</span> gathered out of ſeveral other as well as Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Authours be­fore he printed them, (divers of which latter neither Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> nor his <span class="hi">learned Doctour</span> had ever ſeen or heard of, had not they found them in the CRITICKS) print this <span class="hi">Collection,</span> I ſay, which he made for his own <span class="hi">private uſe:</span>) but till then Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> will give neither him nor Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> leave to tamper with any thing that has ſo im­mediate a relation to himſelf by way of Propriety.</p><p>The other, of Epitomizing <span class="hi">Speed,</span> &amp;c. (which Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies is exactly <span class="hi">his</span> Caſe) is as ſhallow: But the main thing that Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> obſerves by Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s <span class="hi">ramble,</span> from the CRITICKS, to <span class="hi">Law-Books,</span> from them to <span class="hi">Dictionaries,</span> to <span class="hi">Hiſtorians,</span> to one thing after another, is this, that Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s aim is for the <span class="hi">levelling</span> of <span class="hi">all Propriety</span> in any ſorts of Books whatſoever: and if he be not well obſerved in his preſent motion, he (or ſome other of his Friends that now <span class="hi">lie fallow</span> and have leiſure enough) may ere long attempt farther in ſubjects of another nature, eſpecially if he once finde himſelf of ſtrength to deal with Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> in the preſent Diſpute.</p><p>But the thing that does moſt of all <span class="hi">ſting</span> and <span class="hi">nettle</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> is Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span>'s challenging him of <span class="hi">breach</span> of <span class="hi">Pro­miſe</span> before his going into <span class="hi">Holland,</span> which was, that he would deſiſt in his Deſign till Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s return from thence. Here Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> is <span class="hi">ſore</span> and <span class="hi">winces,</span> and at laſt is ſo far carried as to ſay he is ready to contradict Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> with an <span class="hi">Oath,</span> (which it may be for all that he would not doe if he were put to it.) He ſays, had any ſuch <span class="hi">Promiſe</span> been made, Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> would have put it in his <span class="hi">Firſt</span> Paper. That Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> ſpared him then, was out of a reſpect he had to his <span class="hi">Coat,</span> (though Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s were never perfectly <span class="hi">black</span>) and the hope he had he ſhould have no occaſion to urge it. But <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> nothing elſe would ſerve the turn, Mr.<span class="hi">Bee</span> thought it f<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> to dally no longer, but to let the world know how <span class="hi">unworthily</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> had dealt by him. So that it was no <span class="hi">afternoon-dream,</span> as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole waggiſhly</span> ſuggeſts, but a real <span class="hi">Truth</span> of ſome weeks ſtanding, though then firſt awak'd by Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> to the confutation of Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span>'s boaſt of his great <span class="hi">Sincerity</span> and <span class="hi">Candour</span> in this whole Tranſaction. But let Mr.<span class="hi">Poole</span> have a care, that notwithſtanding Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s <span class="hi">afternoon-dream,</span> he be not up time enough in the <span class="hi">morning</span> to meet him in the firſt full career of his <span class="hi">vigorous proceeding,</span> and take the boldneſs to bid him <span class="hi">Stand.</span> For Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s good invention, let any man judge where the <span class="hi">Invention</span> lies, and who has the beſt <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1714"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98363&amp;page=3">[Page 4]</a></span> knack that way, by the ſeveral Weakneſſes Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> has been trapp'd in through this whole Paper hitherto. When Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> cites 2 <span class="hi">Kings</span> 9. 11. Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is afraid he is beſide the Text, and had turned down the wrong leaf, or that he prick'd with a Pin for it, as Boys do in a <span class="hi">Lottery-Book;</span> otherwiſe Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> thinks he might have as well cited the firſt verſe in <span class="hi">Geneſis</span> as that, for any thing that either the one or the other concerns the preſent buſineſs. But though Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> be a little obſcure here, yet by and by Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> queſtions not but to make the World <span class="hi">know the man and his communication.</span> How much more pertinent had it been for Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> to have turned to another Chapter? where he ſhould have found <span class="hi">Ahab,</span> a branded man for notorious impie­ty, yet making Conſcience in the caſe of another's Vineyard, which he would not ſeize upon either in whole or part without firſt profering an equivalent Compenſation? But as to Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s <span class="hi">Promiſe</span> in <span class="hi">Jewin Street,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is ready to ſwear, that it was given, and for 3 months, with thoſe circumſtances which he has rela­ted in his former Paper. And though it had the fortune to be a <span class="hi">private</span> and <span class="hi">unwitneſſed</span> Tranſaction, (as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſaies, who has otherwhile told Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> that if a <span class="hi">third</span> man ſhould at any time come amongſt them, he would hold no diſcourſe of the buſineſs in difference betwixt them) yet Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> has ſufficient <span class="hi">witneſs,</span> that after his Return from <span class="hi">Holland,</span> this Paſſage was betwixt Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> and him in his Shop. Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> there in diſ­courſe taxed Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> with faileur in his Promiſe made before he went over. Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> then, as now, de­nied any ſuch Promiſe. What was it then, Mr. <span class="hi">Poole,</span> ſaid Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> that you and I talked of ſo long together in <span class="hi">Jewin street?</span> Was it not about my buſineſs? And was there nothing of a Promiſe mention'd? Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> at laſt ingenuouſly confeſs'd he promiſed for <span class="hi">three weeks.</span> This was over-heard and ready to be atteſted by one then at a little diſtance from us. Now Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> leaves it to others to judge, the onely <span class="hi">ground</span> of the <span class="hi">Pro­miſe</span> being his neceſſary occaſion of abſence in the <span class="hi">Low-Countries</span> about his Concerns, which he then told Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> would require <span class="hi">three months</span> time; whether it were to any purpoſe for Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> to promiſe, or Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> to accept the Promiſe for <span class="hi">three weeks,</span> which was all one as if there had been no Promiſe at all; and whether it be not probable (there being a Promiſe made) it was rather for the whole term Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Occa­ſions required; who, had it not been that he had thought himſelf ſecure during his being abroad upon Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s word paſſed, had at leaſt <span class="hi">deferr'd</span> his Voiage till ſome time after. But Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> grows warm, and ſaies he is ready to make Oath before a Magiſtrate that he made no ſuch Promiſe. Though Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is not a little pleaſed to find Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> ſo far coming on, that at length he can perſuade himſelf to be willing to take ſome kind of Oath upon ſome occaſion; yet for him, who, after ſome boggling, at laſt refuſed and ſtill ſtands out againſt a <span class="hi">Subſcription</span> tendered from the great Authority of the Nation, tending ſo much to the preſerva­tion of the quiet and peace of the Nation, for <span class="hi">him</span> to make his firſt Eſſay of Swearing in a Caſe tending to his own private profit and advantage, to the manifeſt Detriment of his neighbour, and where Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is con­fident the Truth ſtands againſt him; Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> deſires him to conſider whether there be not ſomething of his own <span class="hi">Gnat</span> and <span class="hi">Camel</span> in the caſe.</p><p>For Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s ſpreading a Report, that Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s Work was ſtopp'd; Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> gives this ſhort Anſwer in Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s ear: <span class="hi">'Tis falſe.</span> But if any employ'd by Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> to diſperſe his <span class="hi">Specimens</span> ſhould accidentally glean up ſuch a ſtory in the <span class="hi">Coffee-houſe,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> cannot help it, nor is he bound to anſwer what people ſay in that <span class="hi">prattling School.</span> How could Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> goe about to raiſe ſuch a Report, when he knew in his Conſci­ence he neve<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> had mov'd the leaſt ſtep towards the <span class="hi">ſtopping</span> of it? For as long as Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> was but onely words and Preparations, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> never troubled himſelf to meddle with him, or by any Application extra­ordinary to diſturb him; neit<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er is he a man of that temper, to impound his neighbour's Cattel till he take them <span class="hi">Damage-feaſant.</span> Now, is his time to <span class="hi">ſtop</span> him; and it may be Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> may ſoon find it more then a <span class="hi">Report.</span></p><p>But in the mean while, who raiſed the Report both in the City and Univerſities, that Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s friends need not make ſuch a ſtir about Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s unjuſt and hard dealing with Mr. <span class="hi">Bee,</span> for Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> was well ſatisfied by Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> in the buſineſs? Certainly this muſt be either Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s doing, (the ſtory is ſo falſe) or Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> knows not where to look the Authour; it being probable no unintereſted perſon would concern himſelf to hammer out ſuch a notorious invention. It muſt therefore be at leaſt a <span class="hi">Sharer</span> in the <span class="hi">Synopſis of Criticall and other Commentators</span> that firſt contrived it, as Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is well aſſured it was firſt publiſhed and maintained in the above-named talking <span class="hi">Academy.</span></p><p>To conclude, let Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> reſt content with what is his own, and leave Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> to diſpoſe as he thinks good of what is <span class="hi">his;</span> let him leave out the <span class="hi">Critical,</span> and retain his <span class="hi">other Commentators:</span> if then Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> have oc­caſion to cite here and there a paſſage out of Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span>'s Authours, (for confirmation of the Subject he treats on, as he may a Text of Scripture in a Sermon, according to the Judgement of one of his Lawyers) Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> ſhall not be againſt it, provided he do it <span class="hi">civilly</span> and <span class="hi">modeſtly;</span> for Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> does not love he ſhould cite <span class="hi">all</span> his Book thus <span class="hi">at a time.</span> But if a <span class="hi">Synopſis</span> be a Beaſt of that nature, to hook and fang in all that lies within its reach for its Maſter's advantage, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> thinks it not fit to be endured in a Commonwealth where <span class="hi">Meum</span> and <span class="hi">Tuum</span> are in faſhion. It is yet in Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span>'s power for him and Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> to part friends, the fault is elſe at <span class="hi">his</span> door: but in caſe Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> proceeds in his perverſe humour, Mr. <span class="hi">Bee</span> is reſolved (with God's help) to make uſe of thoſe Remedies which are proper for the Diſeaſe, and to endeavour by the beſt Art he can to put a ſtop to Mr. <span class="hi">Poole</span> in his unreaſonable proceedings.</p><blockquote class="closer"><div class="dateline"><span class="date">June 10. 1668.</span></div></blockquote></div><div class="publishers_advertisement" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><div class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2098"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=98363&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><span class="head">An Advertiſement concerning M<sup>r</sup>.
