## 1\. Cupids Courteſie: OR, The young Gallant foild at his own Weapon.

He ſcorned Cupid and his Dart,

Until he felt a wounded Heart.

By J. P.

To a pleaſant Northern Tune.

_[figure]_

THough the cool ſhady Woods, as I was ranging,

I heard the pretty Birds notes ſweetly changing;

Down by a Meadow ſide, there runs a River,

A little Boy I eſpy'd with Bow and Quiver.

Little Boy, tell me why thou art here diving,

Art thou ſome Run-away, and haſt no biding?

I am no Run-away, Venus my mother,

She gave me leave to play when I came hither.

Little Boy go with me, and be my Servant

I will take care to ſet for thy preferment;

If I with thee ſhould go, Venus would chide me,

And take away my Bow, and never abide me.

Little Boy let me know, what's thy name termed,

That thou doſt wear a Bow, and go ſo armed,

You may perceive the ſame, with often changing,

Cupid it is my name, I live by ranging.

If Cupid be thy name, that ſhoots at Rovers,

I have heard of thy fame, by wounded Lovers:

Should any languiſh that are ſet on fire,

By ſuch a naked Brat, I much admire.

_[figure]_

IF thou doſt but the leaſt, at my Laws grumble,

Ile pierce thy ſtubborn Breſt and make thee humble;

If I with golden Dart, wound thee but ſurely,

There's no Phyſicians art, that e're can cure thee.

Little Boy with thy Bow, why doſt thou threaten?

It is not long ago ſince thou was beaten:

Thy wanton Mother fair, Venus will chide thee,

When all thy Arrows are gone, thou mayeſt go hide thee.

Of powerful ſhafts you ſee, I am well ſtored,

Which makes my diety, ſo much adored:

With one poor Arrow now, Ile make thee ſhiver,

And bend unto my Bow, and fear my Quiver.

Dear little Cupid be courteous and kindly,

I know thou canſt not hit but ſhooteſt blindly.

Although thou calls me blind, ſurely i'le hit thee,

That thou ſhalt quickly find, Ile not forget thee.

Then little Cupid caught his Bow ſo nimble,

And ſhot a fatal Shaft which made him tremble:

Go tell thy Miſtreſs dear, thou canſt diſcover,

What all the Paſſions are, of a dying Lover.

And now this gallant heart, ſorely was bleeding,

And felt the greateſt ſmart from Love proceeding:

He did her help implore, whom he affected,

But found that more and more, him ſhe rejected.

For Cupid with his craft quickly had choſen,

And with a leaden ſhaft, her heart had frozen,

Which caus'd this Lover, more ſadly to languiſh,

And Cupids aid implore, to heal his anguiſh.

He humble pardon crav'd for his offence paſt,

And vow'd himſelf a ſlave, and to Love ſtedfaſt;

His prayers ſo ardent were, whilſt his heart panted,

That Cupid lent an ear, and his ſuit granted.

For by his preſent plaint, he was regarded,

And his adored Saint, his Love rewarded:

And now they live in joy, ſweetly imbraceing,

And left the little Boy in the Woods chaſing.

FINIS.
