## 1\. The True Lover's Paradice.

Cupid with his Golden Dart

Pierc'd this Youngſter to the Heart;

He counts Love a pleaſant pain,

And his Freedom doth diſdain,

Let other Lovers pattern take

By him who'll Dye for Celia's ſake,

To an Excellent New Play-Houſe Tune: Or, Ah how Pleaſant are the Charms of
Love.

AH! how pleaſant are the Charms of Love,

which like Streams are always flowing?

Ah! how pleaſant are the Charms of Love,

which like Streams are always flowing?

So my Paſſion's ſtill a growing,

nothing but my Celia's eyes can move,

So my Paſſion's ſtil a growing,

perfect and immortal are the joys above.

When Celia did my heart ſurprize,

every Sinew felt a pleaſure:

Each kind look from her obliging eyes

fill'd my heart with endleſs Treaſure:

Love, O Love! is the only Treaſure,

joy and bleſſing from the grave and wiſe,

Give me Love, and Life, and Pleaſure,

I ſhall never envy what the World enjoys.

In Love I chiefly now delight,

and Doting grown in me on wonder,

The Darts which did me once affright,

and dread me far worſe than Thunder,

Now are welcome unto me,

increaſing ſtill my warm deſire:

Celia's Captive I muſt be,

'tis ſhe and none but ſhe, that feeds my fire.

'Tis ſhe that breeds my hearts content,

I am like one dead without her,

If from me once ſhe doth abſent,

ſhe carries all joys about her:

With her looks ſhe kills or ſaves me,

and breeds my comfort, or my grief,

In ſubjection ſhe enſlaves me,

Celia thou moſt cunningly haſt plaid the Thief.

I now take pleaſure in my Chains,

in my Fetters I delight me,

Yet ſure to feel unceſſant pains,

if my Celia once doth ſlight me:

On my heart is her impreſſion,

adding to my paſſion night and day,

I from Love make no digreſſion,

Celia at thy feet my deareſt Life I'll lay.

Oh was ever ſuch a pleaſant wound

as my tender heart hath pierced?

Or ever ſuch a pleaſing found:

or any in love better verſed;

Freedom now ſhall be deſpiſed,

and Celia I am only thine;

His ſences ſure muſt be diſguiſed

that in his heart deſires to be a Libertine.

Cupid I will only thee adore,

and account it clear my Duty,

My reaſon I do ſhew therefore,

'tis I am compell'd by Beauty

Thy faireſt eyes have so encharm'd me,

thy ſelf love I muſt deny,

And Love's Fire's ſo ſtrangely warm'd me,

Celia I muſt freely for thy Love can dye.

Farewell all thoſe pleaſant Ioys

wherein Free-men are delighted;

For they to me appear as Toys,

by me they ever ſhall be ſlighted:

Love's the thing that doth poſſeſs me,

his Riches fain I would enjoy,

With my Celia, Cupid bleſs me,

nothing then of Croſſes can my Love annoy.
