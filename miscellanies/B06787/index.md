## 1\. THE Young Man's Vindication, A [...]ainſt the Virgin's Complaint.

She rail'd against[?] young Men in a Paſſion great,

But he more mildly ſeemswith[?] her to treat;

Young Men are not ſo bad as ſhe would make them.

Some[?] Maids a [...]e full as bad, how e're[?] you take them.

Tune o [...], The Virgin's Complaint: or, Cupid's Courteſie.

SWeet Virgin, hath Diſdain.

mov'd you to Paſſion,

N'er to love Man again,

but for the faſhion?

Was your abuſe ſo great,

beyond all meaſure,

That you can quite for get,

to think of Pleaſure?

Thou [...]h one falſe-hearted Man,

[...] to be named,

Ma [...] you look pale and wan,

muſt all be blamed?

As if ſcarce one were good,

in a whole City;

Your peviſh angry Mood,

I can but pity.

Men are not half ſo bad,

as you would make them;

More Maidens may be had,

if you forſake them:

Therefore I tell you plain,

be not diſdain [...]u [...],

If Cupid ſhoot again,

you'll find it painful.

Young Men had need beware,

leaſt they be taken,

And drawn into a Snare

and ſo forſaken.

Many Maid's prove untrue,

take it for certain,

'Twill be too late to rue,

of a bad Bargain.

Maidens falſe hearted are,

I can report it,

Their Craft they will not ſpare,

when they are courted:

They'll bend unto your Bow,

their VVits are nimble,

It's very hard to know,

wh [...]n they diſſemble.

They'll powder, prank and paint,

with each new Fangle,

Sometimes ſit like a Saint,

for to intangle:

Their pretty wanton Eyes,

are ſo alluring,

Life and Death in them lies,

Killing and Curing.

Their Beauty's like a Charm,

Lovers intrancing,

No Man receives mo [...]e Harm,

then by their Glancing;

Like Syrens they will ſing,

their Voices raviſh,

They make the Ecchoes ring,

their Tongues are laviſh.

By ſuch alluring Baits,

young Men are taken,

And then it is their Fates,

to be forſaken:

For the ſeen ticing Girls,

are ſo unconſtant,

They're won and loſt again,

all in an inſtant.

I have experience had

of their falſe dealing,

Some of them are ſo bad,

t [...]ey're not worth ſtealing,

If one in half a ſ [...]ore,

prove to be Vertuou [...],

She ſhall have Suitors ſtore,

her Love is precious.

Now tell me which are beſt,

young Men or Maidens?

I think 'tis here confeſt,

both have their Fai [...]ings:

Therefore be rul'd by me,

ſcorn not a young Man,

There's as much Truth in him,

as in a Woman.

Virgins take my Advice,

be not diſdainful,

Neither be coy nor nice,

ſquemiſh nor ſcornful;

'Tis but a pettiſh Strain,

for to love no Man;

If e're you love again,

pray love a young Man.

I am reſolved now,

tho' ſome miſcarry,

I'll have a Virgin too,

with her I'll marry:

Fro [...] love I'll not refrain,

tho' it be common,

But when I love again,

I'll love a Woman.
