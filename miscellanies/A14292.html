First, No women euer sacrificed in the <span class="hi">Old Testament.</span> Secondly, If any women, it had beene a regular Custome in the Church, that <span class="hi">Mary</span> her selfe did sacrifice in the <span class="hi">New Testament,</span> which wee neuer read of.

Fistly, Women were forbidden to speake in the Church.</p><p>Out of these Propositions he proues, that the <span class="hi">Virgin Mary</span> is not to be worshipped. First, Because he is a <span class="hi">Deuill,</span> which making a <span class="hi">God</span> of a mortall na­ture in the eyes of men, doth expresse by the varie­ties of Art any carued Images, which represent the shape of man. Secondly, Because the minde com­mits adulterie, which falls from the euer-liuing <span class="hi">God</span> to honour the Images of the Dead, like to a <span class="hi">Whore,</span> which forgoes the lawfull vse of a Husband to lye with others. Thirdly, Because <span class="hi">Mary</span> was not giuen vs to be worshipped, but that her selfe should wor­ship her <span class="hi">Sonne.</span> Fourthly, For that these words in the <span class="hi">Gospel</span> doth warne vs to take heed: <span class="hi">Woman, what haue I to doe with thee?</span> That by these words wee <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9848"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=54">[Page 79]</a></span> might note in calling her <span class="hi">Woman,</span> that others might not admire her, as a <span class="hi">Virgin</span> too holy and sacred. Fiftly, Because in the Scriptures wee doe not find, that any of the <span class="hi">Prophets</span> euer commanded vs to worship any man, much lesse a woman. Sixtly, <span class="hi">God</span> allowes vs not to worship <span class="hi">Angels.</span> Therefore hee will not haue vs to worship <span class="hi">Mary.</span> Shee may bee mentioned with honour.

The like, though not so openly, those ancient <span class="hi">Christians</span> were tolerated to enioy priuately in their Houses, as in hugger-mugger at <span class="hi">Rome,</span> the Capitall Seate of that Empire. In processe of time <span class="hi">Constantine the Great</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12308"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=67">[Page 104]</a></span> attained to the Empire, who for some causes, and principally because he would bee a neerer Neigh­bour to the Northerne Nations, and also to the <span class="hi">Persians,</span> who infested his State with sundry inrodes and hostile inuasions, he was constrained to remoue the Imperiall Seate to <span class="hi">Constantinople,</span> leauing the <span class="hi">Bishop of Rome</span> some power at <span class="hi">old Rome,</span> whereby in his absence hee might, as a Reuerend Prelate with his graue and Christianly exhortations retaine the Citizens in their Alleageance. In this sort these good <span class="hi">Bishops</span> continued loyall to their <span class="hi">Prince</span> and subiect to their Command and to their Successours in the Empire, vntill the <span class="hi">yeere of our Lord,</span> 606. a­bout which time after a great contention for the Primacie betwixt them and the <span class="hi">Patriarch of Con­stantinople,</span> which then was called <span class="hi">New Rome, Pho­cas</span> by the murther of his Lord and Master <span class="hi">Maurice the Emperour,</span> hauing gotten the Soueraigntie made <span class="hi">Boniface the Third</span> Supreme Bishop aboue all other Bishops, and to that end sent forth a Decree, <span class="hi">that all the Churches in his Empire should obey him as their Soueraigne Bishop,</span> which Iurisdiction he held onely <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note66">Naucler.</span> in Spiritull matters. After this the <span class="hi">Emperour Iustine Iustinians Sonne raigned;</span> who sent <span class="hi">Longinus</span> as his Deputy into <span class="hi">Italy,</span> to settle the confused state there­of after the expulsion of the <span class="hi">Gothes,</span> who altered the forme of Gouernment in <span class="hi">Rome,</span> and abrogated the <span class="hi">Senate</span> and <span class="hi">Consulary</span> Dignities, which till that time continued and carried with it a glimpse of the ancient <span class="hi">Maiestie of the Romane State,</span> and in steed of them appointed one Principall Gouernour, whom <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12387"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=67">[Page 105]</a></span> he called an <span class="hi">Exarch</span> or Viceroy. This innouation ministred an occasion to the <span class="hi">Lumbards</span> to enter into <span class="hi">Italie.</span> And then the Citie of <span class="hi">Rome</span> felt new trou­bles. But at last, <span class="hi">Theodoricus King of the Goths</span> by the <span class="hi">Popes</span> Counsell remoued from <span class="hi">Rome,</span> and e­rected <span class="hi">Rauenna</span> to be the Head Citie of his King­dome, and there keeping his <span class="hi">Royall Court</span> gaue room to the <span class="hi">Popes</span> to flourish in <span class="hi">Rome.</span> Sometimes they tooke part with the <span class="hi">Emperour,</span> some other times with the <span class="hi">Lumbards,</span> accommodating their fortunes warily to the strongest parties liking. Thus they continued vntill the <span class="hi">Emperour Heraclius</span> his time, who being oppressed by the <span class="hi">Persians, Saracens,</span> and <span class="hi">Arabians</span> vnder <span class="hi">Mahomet,</span> was so farre from loo­king into the affaires of <span class="hi">Italy,</span> and into the <span class="hi">Popes</span> as­piring designes, that he found much adoe to defend his neerer territories from those bloudy Enemies and Infidels. The <span class="hi">Popes</span> watchfull to take aduan­tage partly by their Religious carriage among the common people, and partly by Rewards got them­selues to be equall in Power with the <span class="hi">Kings</span> of the <span class="hi">Lumbards.</span> And then <span class="hi">Pope Gregorie</span> finding him­selfe reasonable strong, assaulted <span class="hi">Ra<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>enna</span> the chiefe Citie of <span class="hi">Italie</span> and tooke it. But being presently expulsed out of it by <span class="hi">Astulfus King of the Lum­bards,</span> hee was reseized thereof againe by succours sent vnto him from <span class="hi">Pipin King of France.</span> After <span class="hi">A­stulfus</span> death the <span class="hi">Pope</span> falling at ods with <span class="hi">Desiderius</span> the sonne of <span class="hi">Astulfus,</span> hee sent for aide to <span class="hi">Charles the Great King Pipins Sonne,</span> who in proper person came into <span class="hi">Italie,</span> tooke <span class="hi">Desiderius</span> Prisoner, aug­mented <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12524"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=68">[Page 106]</a></span> the <span class="hi">Popes</span> Dominion, and at his motion crowned himselfe <span class="hi">Emperour of the West</span> at <span class="hi">Rome.</span> At which time he againe to requite his good will ena­cted, that from thenceforth the <span class="hi">Bishop of Rome</span> as <span class="hi">Christs Vicar should neuer more bee subiect to any Earthly Potentate.</span> And whereas before that time they were themselues confirmed <span class="hi">Bishops</span> by the <span class="hi">Emperour</span> at <span class="hi">Constantinople,</span> now by this new <span class="hi">Em­perour of the West,</span> they began to be of themselues, and by their wits got the <span class="hi">Emperours</span> to be inuested at their hands. This <span class="hi">Pope</span> was <span class="hi">Leo the third.</span> And this notable Accident and alteration fell out about 801. yeares after <span class="hi">Christ.</span> After <span class="hi">Leo</span> his decease, <span class="hi">Pope Paschale</span> after the example of his Predecessour <span class="hi">Leo;</span> who had wrested the nomination of the <span class="hi">Pope</span> from the people of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> and also the confirmation from the <span class="hi">Emperour at Constantinople,</span> caused those <span class="hi">Priests</span> of the <span class="hi">Citie,</span> who had elected him as the next neigh­bours to be enobled with a glorious Title, and to be called Cardinalls. Thus in lesse then two hundred yeares after their Supremacie, obtayned from <span class="hi">Pho­cas</span> in spirituall matters, the <span class="hi">Popes</span> aspired to a Su­premacie in temporall affaires, not so much for their hypocriticall holinesse, as indeed for the Dig­nitie and repute of the Place and Seat, their <span class="hi">Citie of Rome</span> hauing beene the Lady of the world, and the eyes of all men being fixt on that Place, brought at length most <span class="hi">Princes of Christendome,</span> as Factions grew betwixt them, to make profitable vse of their friendship, either to appease their Aduerfaries, or vnder colour of their Excommunications and Saint <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12618"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=68">[Page 107]</a></span> <span class="hi">Peters keyes</span> to oppresse one another. Yea, and that which was most strange, as <span class="hi">Machiauell</span> obserues in his <span class="hi">Florentine Historie, King Iohn of England</span> vpon the dissention betweene him and his Subiects yeel­ded himselfe at the <span class="hi">Popes</span> dispose, when hee dur<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> not shew his face in <span class="hi">Rome,</span> by reason of the Facti­ons of the <span class="hi">Orsini</span> and <span class="hi">Columneses,</span> and of the <span class="hi">Gu<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ses</span> and the <span class="hi">Gibellines,</span> but was faine to translate the <span class="hi">Papacie</span> to <span class="hi">A<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>inion</span> in <span class="hi">France.</span> Whereby our <span class="hi">Politi­cians</span> may gather this remarkable Rule, that things which seeme to bee and are not such in very de<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d, are more feared or regarded afarre off, then at home by reason of the vncertaine knowledge, which strangers haue of other mens states. Thus may all good <span class="hi">Christians</span> note by what meanes the Church of <span class="hi">Rome</span> arriued to her Greatnesse, and how like a Foxe by little and little the Pope crept vp to the double Supremacie, which Saint <span class="hi">Peter</span> and the bles­sed <span class="hi">Apostles</span> neuer once dreamed, nor would our Sauiour <span class="hi">Christ</span> by any meanes accept of the Tem­porall Sword. For hee vtterly defied the Deuill, when hee motioned vnto him of an Earthly King­dome. And when some purposed afterwards to make him King, he forsooke that Coast. To con­clude this point of the <span class="hi">Popes Supremacie, Pope Hil­debrand,</span> whom some call <span class="hi">Gregory</span> the seuenth, after much contestation with the <span class="hi">Emperour</span> and his <span class="hi">Gi­bellines</span> was the first which triumphed ouer him a­bout one thousand yeeres after Christ. Of whom an ancient Historiographer thus testifieth: To this man only doth the <span class="hi">Latin Church</span> ascribe, that she is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12731"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=69">[Page 108]</a></span> free, and pluckt out of the Emperours hands. By his meanes she stands enriched with so much wealth <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note67"><span class="hi">Onuph. in vit<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Greg.</span> 7.</span> and Temporall Power. By his meanes shee stands inriched with so much wealth and temporall Pow­er. By his meanes shee got the Soueraigntie ouer all <span class="hi">Emperours, Kings,</span> and <span class="hi">Christian Princes;</span> where­as before shee was kept vnder like a base maid ser­uant not only by the <span class="hi">Emperour,</span> but by any <span class="hi">Prince</span> assisted by the <span class="hi">Emperour.</span></p><p>To returne now to the other cause, which aug­mented the <span class="hi">Popes Greatnesse,</span> that he cannot erre in <span class="hi">matters of Faith,</span> and therefore men are perswaded to beleeue in his Church, as the onely <span class="hi">Catholick</span> in the world, or indeed as if shee were equall vnto <span class="hi">Christ</span> in Puritie, and therefore partaker of our Creede. But the Truth auoucheth otherwise, that <span class="hi">all men are Lyers</span> and full of Sinne, euen from the beginning. The most Righteous man sinnes euery day in the weeke. The <span class="hi">Apostles</span> in <span class="hi">Christs</span> time contended for Dignitie. After his death <span class="hi">Peter</span> and <span class="hi">Paul</span> varied in opinion. <span class="hi">Paul</span> and <span class="hi">Barnabas</span> could not agree. <span class="hi">Liberius</span> Bishop of <span class="hi">Rome</span> subscribed to the <span class="hi">Arrian Heresie. Honorius</span> Bishop of <span class="hi">Rome</span> was a <span class="hi">Monothelite,</span> and condemned for the same Heresie by the <span class="hi">Generall Councell</span> held at <span class="hi">Constantinople.</span> Saint <span class="hi">Augustine</span> mentions of the Errour maintayned by <span class="hi">Innocent</span> Bishop of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> that Innocents could not be saued, except they receiued the Communion. And as <span class="hi">Popes</span> erred thus in <span class="hi">matters of Faith:</span> so did <span class="hi">Generall Councels</span> themselues most grossely erre.

For if the Occa­sions of <span class="hi">Suites</span> were taken away, men would follow their Husbandry diligently at home, fall to enclo­sures, plant Orchards, marle their Lands, and not scratch the Earth with weake Heyfers or Steeres. They might then keepe strong Oxen to plough withall, which now they are enforced to sell for their <span class="hi">Lawiers</span> vse.

That hee was sory to see such extreme seueritie. Yet notwithstanding some­what glad, that the matter hauing beene so charge­able and trouble some for a long time he might now enioy the continuall company of his wife and chil­dren at home, which before he could not doe. That Peace was a blessed thing, and Patience an excellent vertue. Which the Gentleman hearing, and hauing no comfort else for his great expence, paines, and troubles, he brake forth into Passion, saying, what doe you tell me of Peace and Patience, and going home to haue the company of my wife and chil­dren? All this I had before I met with your vnfor­tunate Counsell, and but for you I might haue had more meanes to doe for them, then now I haue.

But the matter casually discouered, some of them were hanged, and the rest made Gal­ly-slaues, which comming to the eares of Captaine <span class="hi">Eliot</span> at <span class="hi">Madrid,</span> and hearing, that his Brother, whom he had left to ouer-see the Pinnasse, had like­wise tasted of this <span class="hi">Spanish</span> Courtesie, hee repayred in this male-content to <span class="hi">Father Parsons,</span> pittifully complayning of his cruell fortune, and this bloudie course extended toward his people, which hee brought of purpose to serue the <span class="hi">King of Spaine,</span> ho­ping of reward rather then to bee so inhumanely dealtwith. <span class="hi">Father Parsons</span> at that time being more in a moode of deuotion, then willing to shew himselfe a Statesman, began to reade a Lecture to Captaine <span class="hi">Eliot</span> of Patience, Humilitie, and of Mortification.

They answered, that it was not the loue of the wine, but of the Compa­nie, which drew them to carowse so many pots. And further they alledged, that their natures be­ing accustomed to drinke, they bare it out well without the least giddinesse in the head, reeling, or staggering, which as long as they could so doe, they hoped no man might taxe them of Drunkennesse. To this <span class="hi">Apollo</span> replied, that by the late <span class="hi">Statutes of England</span> no Trauellers might drinke aboue one q<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>rt of Ale or Beere at a penny the quart, vpon one <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>itting or meale: so that to drinke more then that measure prescribed by <span class="hi">Law,</span> ought to bee con­strued <span class="hi">Drunkennesse,</span> because the wise <span class="hi">Law-makers</span> of that <span class="hi">State</span> foresaw, that so much would serue any reasonable Creature.

And whereas (said he) yee would couer your Drunkennesse with the ablenesse of your braine, I must tell you, that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e25760"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=127">[Page 75]</a></span> he is to bee termed a reall Drunkard which surpas­seth the set stint of his Countryes Lawes, or if hee enters after his bibbing into any vnseemely passion or borrowes the gesture of a raging Lion, of the toyish Ape, of the sensuall Hog, or of the lasciui­ous Goat, pratling or acting any feates more then are decent, or more then he vsed at other times, he may be branded with the note of a Drunkard, then which nothing is more odious in the sight of our vertuous Societie. Bring a horse to the water, all the world cannot vrge him to drinke more then sufficeth nature at that time. And yet man a Creature enriched with free will in naturall things, wil proue himselfe worse then the Beasts which haue no vn­derstanding. Most honourable be those Masters of Families, which hate and curb this wanton excesse of Drinking in their Seruants. And worthy of ap­plause in our <span class="hi">Court</span> is that <span class="hi">Nobleman,</span> who seeing no admonitions nor change of Butlers could restraine his vnruly Seruants from this Swinish vice, caused his seller to bee remoued, by building one within his Parlour, whereby shame, his Eye being vpon them, might bridle their inordinate affections, free­ly protesting, that hee would haue nothing spent which might be honestly spared, nor any thing spa­red which might be honestly spent; that it was not the expence, but ciuill gouernment to settle sobrie­tie in his house, which made him to take so strict a course. In this he imitated that Learned <span class="hi">Emperour Antonius Pius,</span> which banished all the Wine­tauernes in <span class="hi">Rome,</span> because hee saw his Subiects be­gin <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e25794"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=128">[Page 76]</a></span> to turne Drunkards, and that none but <span class="hi">Apo­thecaries</span> should presume to sell any wine; and that, as Phy sick to the sick and weake. Heeretofore a <span class="hi">King of England</span> noting that by the Companie of the <span class="hi">Daues</span> all his Subiects were infected with this Sinne, he imposed a fit and limited measure for eue­ry man to drinke by. Within these fiftie yeeres Drunkennesse was scarce knowne in <span class="hi">England.</span> At such time as the <span class="hi">Low Countrey</span> warres began, the souldiers at their returne by the <span class="hi">Diuels</span> temptations brought it thither to impouerish their natiue Coun­try.

The Wise­man <span class="hi">Thales,</span> hee said, would faine haue a Surgeon of the <span class="hi">Fairy-land</span> to open a little window in the heart of man, whereby all his deceitfulnesse might appeare to one anothers sight.

In conclusion, <span class="hi">Traiano Boccalini</span> accused these <span class="hi">Reformers</span> for their Hypocriticall suggestions and conspiracies against the sacred honour of <span class="hi">Apol­lo,</span> in setting out <span class="hi">Proclamations</span> onely to please Fooles, that no Hucksters should sell oaten meale, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e26638"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=132">[Page 85]</a></span> or pease by a false dish, and such like trifling mat­ters.

Saint <span class="hi">George</span> answered, that the causes of his sadnesse conceiued for the vices and decayes of <span class="hi">Great Brit­taine</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e26809"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=133">[Page 87]</a></span> proceeded of a fellow-feeling of a vertuous Conscience, and to that end they came now to discouer their knowldge, and to lay open the ge­nerall faults of that <span class="hi">Monarchie</span> in a new kinde of tickling straine, not so much to content the Iudici­ous, for <span class="hi">they that be whole need no Physicians,</span> as to draw the carnall minds of the Common people to heare their <span class="hi">vices</span> blamed, and consequently to make them ashamed, which are not altogether past grace.

Whereto he ad­ioyned, that by many yeares experience, hee had learnt the skill of discerning spirits. And that hee found out this quality of the <span class="hi">English,</span> to delight in <span class="hi">varieties;</span> of <span class="hi">Newes,</span> though for the most part false; of <span class="hi">Apparell,</span> though they sold their lands for it; of <span class="hi">multiplicities of Law suits,</span> though oftentimes they knew themselues bought and sold by them which they most trusted; of <span class="hi">meate and drinke,</span> though they felt the euent in grieuous torments. And as in their natures they respected choise and change, so in their outward senses hee obserued first that their <span class="hi">sight</span> receiued more contentment in many colours, then in one alone; specially, those colours of Gold and Siluer, they preferred be­fore the pure and simple, which they held in con­tempt as fitter for Hob-lurkins, then for generous spirits.

The like he said, he could discourse of the rest of their senses, outward and inward.

By which meditations of mine, I perceiued, that nothing but <span class="hi">gaine</span> could moue the carelesse minds of our <span class="hi">Ilanders</span> to seeke abroad for new habitati­ons. I lookt into the <span class="hi">Plantations</span> at the <span class="hi">Summer Iles, Virginia,</span> yea into <span class="hi">Affrick,</span> as farre as the <span class="hi">Cape of good hope,</span> where for the ease of our <span class="hi">East-Indian Fleetes,</span> I conceiued at <span class="hi">Sancta Helena,</span> or <span class="hi">Soldana,</span> a fit <span class="hi">Plantation</span> might be erected.

It abounds with Deere, as well fallow Deere, as Ellans, which are as bigge as our Oxen. And of all other sorts of wilde Beasts, as here in <span class="hi">Europe,</span> Beuers, Hares, &amp;c. The like I may <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e31996"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=155">[Page 24]</a></span> say for Fowle and Fish. I knew one Fowler in a winter, which killed aboue 700. Partridges him­selfe at <span class="hi">Renoos.</span> But for the Fish, specially the Cod, which drawes all the chiefe Port townes in <span class="hi">Chri­stendome</span> to send thither some ships euery yeare, either to fish, or to buy the same; it is most won­derfull, and almost incredible, vnlesse a man were there present to be hold it. Of these, three men at Sea in a Boat, with some on shoare to dresse and dry them, in thirty dayes will kill commonly be­twixt fiue and twenty and thirty thousand, worth with the Traine oyle arising from them, one hun­dred or sixe score pounds. I haue heard of some <span class="hi">Countries,</span> commended for their twofold haruest, which here we haue, although in a different kinde: yet both as profitable, I dare say, as theirs so much extolld. There is no such place againe in the world for a poore man to raise his fortunes, comparable to this <span class="hi">Plantation;</span> for in one moneths space, with reasonable paines, he may get as much as will pay both Land-lords Rent, Seruants wages, and all Houshold charges, for the whole yeare, and so the rest of his gaine to increase.</p><p>As for the other <span class="hi">question,</span> whether the title of the <span class="hi">Golden Fleece</span> may bee conferred more de­seruedly vpon this <span class="hi">Iland,</span> then on any other for­raigne place, where his <span class="hi">Maiesties</span> Subiects of <span class="hi">Great Britaine</span> doe vse to Trade?

For wee may saile hither within twelue or fourteene daies, being not aboue sixe or seuen hundred leagues passage: whereas <span class="hi">Virginia</span> lieth as far again. Secondly, it is better in respect of <span class="hi">Trade,</span> and the concourse of people, which with 500. or 600. Ships, doe yearly resort thither. By which meanes they augment their <span class="hi">Princes Customes,</span> and doe maintaine many thousands of their fellow-sub­iects, their wiues and children.

The Country I assure your <span class="hi">Maiestie,</span> is as tolerable as <span class="hi">England, Caeteris paribus,</span> comparing all the sea­sons together.</p><p>And if some nice persons feele one <span class="hi">winter</span> a­mong many, more snowy and frosty then other, they seeme to forget their owne Country, where the like inconuenience hapneth.

Secondly, let them dig welles neere their houses against winter, that they may haue water in despite of the frost or snow.

Fourthly, let them build their houses with a hill, or great store of trees interposed as a shelter betwixt them and the <span class="hi">sea-windes,</span> which there are <span class="hi">Easterly</span> and very nipping. There is no <span class="hi">winter</span> to speake of before the midst of <span class="hi">Ianuary.</span> And when the <span class="hi">Easterly windes</span> blow, the weather is no other, then it is in <span class="hi">Holland.</span> And I verily beleeue, that in the <span class="hi">south part</span> of the Land, where it trends to­wards the <span class="hi">west,</span> and where the ground is eauen and plaine without hilles, it differs not much from the temperature of the south part of <span class="hi">Germany.</span> And for the further encouragement of our <span class="hi">Planters,</span> I can auow this for a certaine rule, that once being passed a mile or two into the Land, the weather <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e32316"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=157">[Page 29]</a></span> is farre hotter.

Ha­uing found it a habitable place, commodious for the vse of many distressed people, whom I saw to grone vnder the burthen of pouerty in my natiue Soile; I resolued to imitate the painefull Bees, to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e32638"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=159">[Page 33]</a></span> build houses, like Hiues, and therein to transplant them. For which purpose to auoyd the confused state of an <span class="hi">Anarchy,</span> I prepared the <span class="hi">Plantation</span> intended with the support of the <span class="hi">Regall</span> counte­nance, and to that end got the <span class="hi">Patent</span> specified by my Aduersaries with large priuiledges, immuni­ties, and power, whereby our <span class="hi">Planters</span> might rest assured, not onely of security against Drones, but also of the quiet fruition of their profitable ende­uours hazarded with their liues, and not to bee attained without labours and the sweat of their browes. Of what consequence not only this <span class="hi">Plan­tation</span> is, but likewise all others of the like nature, who knowes better then your <span class="hi">Maiestie,</span> who once a yeare suruayes the vttermost parts of the earth, euen to the <span class="hi">Southerne Pole?</span> For what is it, which renders a <span class="hi">Nation</span> vnhappy? Next to the want of <span class="hi">Gods knowledge,</span> which the <span class="hi">Scripture</span> termes <span class="hi">Dark­nesse,</span> it is the want of necessaries for the sustenta­tion of life, as meat, drinke, and apparell. And when through a long peace, and their ouerspent fields, their Country-men doe increase and mul­ply, so that the extent of their natiue Land is not capable nor sufficient to maintaine them, what (poore soules) shall they doe? If they rob or steale, they are hanged. If they looke for worke, perhaps they may meet with some couetous wretch that will retaine them during the haruest of Hay and Corne: but in the Winter, which in this <span class="hi">Climat</span> is longer then the Summer, they may starue for lacke of food, rayment and fyring.

We neuer gaine-said them to <span class="hi">fish</span> vpon our Coast, but on the contrary, we were very glad of the occasiō.

As for the <span class="hi">Passage,</span> hee verily beleeued as Sir <span class="hi">Martin</span> did, it lay open. And that hee would haue done his endeuour to haue sailed through. For in <span class="hi">Hudsons Bay,</span> hee saw two very likely <span class="hi">passages</span> towards the Northwest, to enter in; but that hee was otherwise authorized and com­manded to goe on <span class="hi">Southwestwards</span> to the bottome of <span class="hi">Hudsons Bay,</span> so that hee durst not but follow the tenor of his <span class="hi">Commission.</span> Yet notwithstanding he hoped, that he had not spent his time in vaine, during his voyage in those angry <span class="hi">climates.</span> For first he discouered, that those Seas could not bee sailed through, but in Iune, Iuly, and August, be­ing alwaies subiect to foggs, ice, stormes, and sud­den windes. The <span class="hi">sunne</span> seldome seene, so that the best <span class="hi">Nauigator</span> can hardly obserue the certaine height thereof. Onely his chiefest comfort during his abode there, was, that the dayes were very long, with very short nights: though otherwise the want of cleernesse to obserue either <span class="hi">sunne</span> or <span class="hi">starre,</span> were able vtterly to ouerthrow the whole voyage. Further, he noted, that Trumpets might not be spared, but most necessary to be had of such as passe in those Seas. For if two ships went toge­ther, they would quickly lose one another by rea­son of the thicke mist, though they went so neere as they might hallow one to the other. Likewise, he said, that <span class="hi">shirts of male</span> might not be spared, for feare of the <span class="hi">sauages</span> arrowes out of some ambusca­do: Or else thicke leather Targets made of Buffe, as the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> vse. To this hee added, that by <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33617"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=165">[Page 45]</a></span> experience hee found another necessary note, which hee wished all such as were imployed in these remote Enterprizes to beare in minde, to carry with them good tooles, as well for repay­ring of their Ships, as to dig on the land, if they suffer shipwracke: And withall, the fittest engines which can bee deuised for weighing of shipping vpon such occasions; and in any case a couple of <span class="hi">Crabs</span> to be brought along with them in these vn­knowne Discoueries, for the hoising and landing of their Ships, or other heauy necessaries, as Artil­lery, Timber, &amp;c. Also, that the Discouerer should marke the set of the <span class="hi">Tide.</span> For whensoeuer he loseth his strong <span class="hi">Tide,</span> or findes ground in 100 <span class="hi">fathomes,</span> let him rest assured, that he goes out of his direct course, for the finding of this hopefull passage. To conclude, Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Button</span> deliue­red two notes more of great consequence for the preseruation of the Discouerers healths and liues, which <span class="hi">Apollo</span> better liked then all the former Dis­courses; whereof the one was, that hee obserued <span class="hi">Aqua vita, Sacke,</span> and such hot liquors, to become most hurtfull to his men in the cold Winter, and on the other side, small drinke and Barly water most soueraine to maintaine them in health. The other obseruation was, that the <span class="hi">iuyce</span> of th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>se ten­der branches or sprigs of trees which flourished fresh and greene in the Winter, out-daring the bitter blasts, and withstanding the extremity of the frosts, being pressed out, and ministred to the <span class="hi">sicke,</span> did miraculously restore them to their health, And the meanes of his first knowledge thereof, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33665"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=166">[Page 46]</a></span> proceeded by seeing of the multitudes of <span class="hi">Partrid­ges,</span> which fed and liued thereon all the Winter, to become fat and plumpe.</p></div><div class="chapter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.3_div.7"><h3><span class="headingNumber">3.7. </span><span class="head">CHAP. 7.</span></h3><div class="argument"><p>Apolloes <span class="hi">Censure of Sir</span> Thomas Buttons <span class="hi">voyage to the</span> Northwest Passage.</p><p><span class="hi">His Directions for the preseruation of health in fro­sty seasons, and for the preuenting of the</span> Scuruy.</p><p><span class="hi">An</span> Elegy <span class="hi">in their commendations which aduentu­red their persons for the discouery of the afore­said</span> Passage.</p></div><p><span class="hi">APollo</span> seemed much delighted with these narrations of Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Button;</span> and to let the vertuous of <span class="hi">Parnassus</span> know some­what more of these remarkeable euents, hee made this discourse: How many famous Captaines here haue I admitted into my <span class="hi">Court,</span> which neuer entred into these hidden and magisteriall secrets of nature?

And now to enter into the lat­ter points of those secrets, which he mentions to haue tried, so vsefull for his peoples health; know this, <span class="hi">O ye that study Physicke,</span> that as <span class="hi">Hippocrates</span> wrote, mens inward parts, specially the stomacke, is hotter in Winter then in Summer. Looke in an extreame frosty Winter, how all the sap and ver­tue of Plants and Hearbs, shoote inwardly, and descend into the root, running thither as to their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33807"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=167">[Page 48]</a></span> sanctuary, refuge, and last helpe in nature. Euen so stands it with the body of man, which for ve­getation and vigorous constitution, may in some sort be compared to a <span class="hi">Plant.</span> In Summer, the heat and radicall moysture is dispersed here and there, vp and downe, and through all the parts of the body, so that the heat in the stomacke is of a mild oily warmth, and at that time more truely natu­rall, then in the <span class="hi">winter.</span> For Experience teacheth, and <span class="hi">Anatomists</span> confirme it, that in the <span class="hi">winter,</span> chiefly in frosty weather, mans liueliest heate set­leth it selfe in the stomacke, neere the heart, the center and root of life, the other parts being op­pressed with cold. There likewise it will beginne quickly to inflame in frosty seasons. When the raw ayre gets into the body at the mouth, and at the pores, or at such time, when these pores of the skinne and outward superficies become thick­ned, whereby the spirits may not haue their free euaporation. Hence grow oppilations and obstru­ctions; and consequently the <span class="hi">Scuruy,</span> being aided on by the meseraicall veines, full of putrified dam­pish blood, or by the melancholike spleen, swolne with too much windy nourishment. For the aba­ting of which infirmities, moyst opening medi­cines of a biting nature, cooling and piercing liquors, somewhat of a milky mildnesse, and the iuyce of springing hearbs, must bee regarded by a wise <span class="hi">Phisitian,</span> and preferred before strong liquors and fiery Drinkes, which commonly are too too binding.

What greater glory can arriue to this part of the world, then to search into the vttermost parts of those Southerne Regions? In all ciuill Countries, the Inhabitants must as well looke into the Artificiall waies of acquiring wealth, as into the naturall meanes abounding in the places of their abode. This consists in Corne, Cattell, Wooll, Lead, Tinne, or in the like Commodities, which are or­dinarily and without much Art deriued from their natiue Seates. The other depends on their in­dustry and more curious skill to work vpon those materialls, as by their Wooll to Compose Stuffes of Serges, Perpetuanaes, Paropous, or the like; or else by Commerce and Traffique to exchange some of their superfluous wares with Forraigners, for some of their superfluities.

Will they feed and sucke still on the blood of their decaied veines? The best grounds will grow out of heart in a short time, vnlesse they be holpen by Art. I confesse the subiect, which I intend now to commend, is sordide, rude, and more beseeming a Clownish <span class="hi">Coridon,</span> then one of my education in this magnifique <span class="hi">Court;</span> yet neuerthelesse, because the same serues to inrich his <span class="hi">Maiesties</span> Territories in these Westerne Coasts, which hee holds as deere as his <span class="hi">Thessalian Tempe,</span> I will disclose the secret meanes to renew the life of ouer-wearied Lands. There is no ground but hath <span class="hi">Marle,</span> ei­ther neere the superficies of it, or deeper in the wombe of the earth abounding. This <span class="hi">Marle</span> in some Countries, by the reuolution of time, is tur­ned to lime, or limestone, and this lime in some places is growne to a finer mould, euen to chalke, which is the perfection of all <span class="hi">Marle.</span> Where none of these abound, nature hauing not as yet wrought her selfe to her fulnesse; I wish euery Landed man with an Augur, boarer, or piercing worme, to search and try in the deepest part of his earth, where the same lieth hid; for surely shallow or thicke, he may finde <span class="hi">Marle</span> vpon his Land. If it be oily, vnctuous, and clammy, then it is fat and rich. It is of sundry colours, and different likewise in the goodnesse. For there is a yellow <span class="hi">Marle,</span> a Red, a Grey, and Blew; all which are good, if they be oily and slippery as Sope, and mixed with earth; as also weake, if it be incorporated with gra­uell, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e35082"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=174">[Page 63]</a></span> stone or sand. The <span class="hi">red Marle</span> is the worst, vnlesse it be found to lye neere the <span class="hi">blew.</span> For the best is the <span class="hi">blew</span> in operation, and will last longest. Next vnto it is the <span class="hi">yellow,</span> and the <span class="hi">grey</span> better then the <span class="hi">red.</span> All which may bee searched after in the veines of the earth. Hauing met with it, let the Husband man glory, that hee hath met with trea­sure, able to supply his owne and his Countries necessities. Onely let him take this for a <span class="hi">Caueat,</span> that at the <span class="hi">first marling</span> of his ground, hee must look he plow not with broad and deepe furrowes, but narrow, lest he throw his <span class="hi">Marle</span> into the dead mould. For the nature of <span class="hi">Marle</span> is to send all the goodnesse downewards, and for that cause it must not be buried too deepe, but still kept aloft on the vpper mould. And in this it differeth much from Dung and Mucke, which spend their vertue vp­ward, and will ascend by their misty vapour springing vp to the face of the ground, though they be buried deeper then they ought to bee. I could admonish men oftener to hearten their out­worne grounds with other remedies, as with the soile of old Ditches, or with sand, or to transferre and temper fresh earth brought from lay grounds, with their ouerspent mould, as they vse in <span class="hi">Deuon­shire.</span> Or to adde tough clay to the tender sandy, for the one is life to the other being so incorpo­rated, specially moist with the dry. But I hope this being practised, their Corne fields will pro­duce sufficient increase, so that they shall not be­come too often beholding to the <span class="hi">Sound of Den­marke</span> for <span class="hi">Rie,</span> as commonly heretofore euery <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e35142"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=175">[Page 64]</a></span> fiue yeares they haue beene.</p><p><span class="hi">Periander</span> after this speech, produced his opini­on: Seeing we haue, like <span class="hi">Moles,</span> begunne to treat of earthly Commodities to inrich this decayed Countrie, let me exhort them to plant <span class="hi">Orchards,</span> the benefits I dare well say, will counteruaile the <span class="hi">French Vineyards</span> if they be rightly followed, and need but small pruning and looking to after the first planting.

If they think it much to erect so many <span class="hi">Salt houses,</span> as will serue all the <span class="hi">Ilanders,</span> by reason of the deare rate of <span class="hi">Coales</span> to be conuerted for other vses, let them set vp some in <span class="hi">Newfound land,</span> some in <span class="hi">New England,</span> and others in <span class="hi">New Scotland,</span> where they may haue plenty of woods. And it is knowne, that Wood fire without conuerting Wood into Charcoale, wil serue to boile <span class="hi">Salt</span> as wel as <span class="hi">Coal.</span> There <span class="hi">Salt</span> be­ing at hand to be had for the <span class="hi">Fishermens</span> vse, it will saue at the least twenty thousand pound, vnto the <span class="hi">English,</span> which now with the tunnage and the <span class="hi">Salt</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note137">Discouery of Newfound Land.</span> they are forced to be at charge. <span class="hi">Captain Whithorne</span> in his book of the Cōmodities of that Country, among other exceeding good notes by him there deliuered, writes, that one Panne will make aboue 20. bushels of good <span class="hi">Salt</span> in euery 24. houres, one­ly with mans labour and the Salt water; and not, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e35344"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=176">[Page 66]</a></span> as some doe vse to make <span class="hi">Salt</span> vpon <span class="hi">Salt;</span> which so there made, shall not stand in three pence the bu­shell to those that prouide in that manner: Wher­as <span class="hi">Salt</span> now stands them in twenty pence at the least euery bushell.

Since the Statute enacted in <span class="hi">King Iames</span> time, for 8. in the 100. money is farre more scarce. And there­fore in my iudgement, if that <span class="hi">Act</span> were repealed, there might insue a twofold benefit. First, money would become more plentifull. And then if an <span class="hi">Act</span> were made, that <span class="hi">Vsurers</span> might be tolerated to take 9. pound in the 100. pound, for one yeares vse, &amp; that the party which borrowes, should pay 20. shillings more to make it vp 10. pound, as in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e35659"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=177">[Page 69]</a></span> former time, and this last to be conuerted towards some meritorious work, mony would waxe more abundant, and no man would grudge to pay 20. shillings for a vertuous purpose.

But in my iudgement next vnto <span class="hi">suits</span> at Law, which the wise <span class="hi">Solon</span> obserued to begger both Towne and Country, the populousnesse of some chiefe Cities, and specially of <span class="hi">London,</span> doth impouerish the <span class="hi">Roy­all Chamber</span> of that <span class="hi">Empire,</span> insomuch that it is in a manner impossible to inrich them, before the Drones, and yong hungry Bees bee remoued to some forraigne Places by an <span class="hi">Act of Parliament,</span> and so prest by transcendent authority. The peo­ple which I would haue thus prest, are the Inmates, the Cottagers, the needy, and needlesse numbers. An honest <span class="hi">Minister</span> assured me, that in his Parish at <span class="hi">London,</span> there were many which perished of want, being ashamed to begge; and that he knew <span class="hi">tenne persons</span> hauing but a roome of twelue foot square to containe them, &amp; but one bed for them all. Many of the like calamity might bee found in that <span class="hi">City,</span> two or three housholds crept into one house; that I haue diuers times wondred, that they are not euery second year visited with the <span class="hi">Plague,</span> or <span class="hi">Purples,</span> considering the multitudes of Chan­nels, Iakes, and other vnpleasing places which in­fect the Aire, able to poyson the strongest Snake. For the verifying of this my allegation, I will pro­duce one example which may serue to confirme the same. I haue heard it reported by very credible persons, that about 4. yeares past in a house neere <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36113"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=180">[Page 74]</a></span> S. <span class="hi">Dunstons</span> of the West, the <span class="hi">Priuies</span> there being emptied on a night, the next morning they found not onely their Brasse and Pewter in the lower roomes soild and filth'd, but likewise their Plate two sto<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>s higher standing on their Cupboord, tainted and corrupted with a yellowish vnseeme­ly colour. Yea and that which <span class="hi">Aristotle</span> himselfe would admire at, they found their money in their purses to haue lost the colour, as if it had beene of purpose varnished with smoaky dung. If the seri­ous regard of their healths moue them not, yet let the wisedome of <span class="hi">Magistrates</span> foresee the in­conuenience which yearely accrues to the Gene­rality, by suffering vnnecessary people to hinder the gaines of the industrious, and withall to know this, that too many of the industrious Craftsmen themselues flocking together, doe so diuide the profit, which more politikely being fitter for a <span class="hi">few,</span> that both the one and the other, are often seene to faint vnder their owne waight. Better it is for a <span class="hi">City</span> to content themselues with a few sub­stantiall neighbours, then to be troubled with ma­ny rakers. If the <span class="hi">City of London,</span> which is thought to hold eight hundred thousand Soules within it, and the Suburbes were rid of 40000 of these, the rest would thriue the better, and saue at least two hundred thousand pounds a yeare, which now are spent in vain, &amp; hereafter wil be conuerted for the weale of the whole <span class="hi">Iland.</span> In one yeare there were suppressed 700. Cottagers in <span class="hi">Glocestershire,</span> since which time, that Country flourished.</p><p><span class="hi">Comineus Lord of Argenton,</span> the great States­man <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36167"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=180">[Page 75]</a></span> of <span class="hi">France,</span> whom <span class="hi">Katherine de Medicis</span> Queen Mother, and somtimes <span class="hi">Regent</span> of that Kingdome, was wont to terme the Heretike of State, because he disclosed the secrets of <span class="hi">Princes,</span> vttered his opi­nion next after <span class="hi">Cornelius Tacitus.</span> In the warres betwixt the <span class="hi">House of Burgundy</span> and my Soueraigne <span class="hi">Lewis the eleuenth,</span> I remember, that <span class="hi">Money</span> fell out very scarce, as it doth now in <span class="hi">Great Britaine,</span> for all that saying, which this wise <span class="hi">King</span> was accu­stomed to repeat, that his <span class="hi">France</span> might be com­pared to a Meadow ready to bee mowne twise a yeare. And one of the principall meanes, which he inuented to be stored with money, was <span class="hi">to raise his Coine.</span> From the <span class="hi">Saxons</span> time vntill my time in the Raigne of <span class="hi">King Henry the sixt,</span> an ounce of Sil­uer was diuided into 20. peeces, and so passed for 20. pence. <span class="hi">King Henry</span> by reason of his wars with vs, and afterwards with the <span class="hi">House of Yorke,</span> proclai­med the ounce at 30. pence. <span class="hi">King Henry</span> the 4. vp­on the like necessity, enhansed it to 40. pence, which so lasted vntill <span class="hi">King Henry the</span> 8. daies, who raised the ounce to the value of 45. pence. <span class="hi">King Edward the</span> 6. proclaimed it at fiue shillings. If Money continues still scant, I see no reason, but that it might be raised higher, as in former times; which also would induce men to bring forth their Plate. In <span class="hi">France, Venice,</span> yea and in Golden <span class="hi">Spaine,</span> Brasse money goes current, two and thirty Mara­uedis amounting to sixe pence; which they call a Reall. Of these Marauedis, I heard a Rhodomon­ting <span class="hi">Castilian</span> vaunt, that hee would bestow 600. thousand of them with his deare Daughter, to her <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36256"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=181">[Page 76]</a></span> mariage. In some Countries they vse Shelles, Pep­per, and lether peeces for money. In other places, gaddes of Steele or Iron. At the first troubles of the <span class="hi">Low Countries,</span> they made stampes on Past-Boords, which they licensed to goe current for Money. In the last warres of <span class="hi">Ireland,</span> base Coine was ordained to supply the vse of the finest Siluer. As long as it will passe in estimation, and warran­ted by publike authority, either Money may bee raised, or the same of a mixt alloy, as the <span class="hi">Venetian Liure,</span> or the <span class="hi">French Souls,</span> or of such other met­tall as the Prince liketh, may serue the Subiects turne in time of warres, as it serues those Nations both in Warre and Peace.</p><p>The <span class="hi">Lord Cromwell</span> succeeded this <span class="hi">Noble French­man,</span> and said: that hee was one of the chiefest In­struments vnder <span class="hi">King Henry the</span> 8. to dissolue the Religious Houses in <span class="hi">England,</span> &amp; wished, that now some of those <span class="hi">Farmes</span> and <span class="hi">impropriated Tithes,</span> were for a few yeares lent by the State of <span class="hi">England</span> to support Ecclesiasticall persons in the new <span class="hi">Plan­tations,</span> meaning those, which the <span class="hi">State</span> could spare in their places. And he hoped by this meanes, the <span class="hi">Clergy</span> being prouided for in those New Lands, <span class="hi">Churches</span> would there be built the sooner, and the <span class="hi">Plantations</span> in a short time would helpe to inrich this <span class="hi">Kingdome</span> with many sorts of Commodities, specially if some of the Religious that went in per­son, &amp; others well beloued in their Country: that for their sakes, others of good account would ac­company them, and so assist the Common-wealth by their power and example.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36333"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=181">[Page 77]</a></span> Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Chaloner</span> renewed the old proiect of building <span class="hi">Busses</span> &amp; flat <span class="hi">Flemish</span> boates for fishing on the Easterly coasts of this kingdome, saying, that it was a shame for his nation to looke on while the <span class="hi">Hollanders</span> yearely tooke worth 300000 pounds of fish vpon our sea coasts, and in our liber­ties, although they fished farther off then they did; for the truth of which assertion of his he alleadged the testimony of <span class="hi">Bartolus</span> the famous Lawier. <span class="hi">As Ilands</span> (saith he) <span class="hi">in the sea next adioyning, so likewise the Sea it selfe to an hundred miles extent is assigned to the bordering Countrey, I<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Insul ff <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>de Iur.</span></p><p><span class="hi">Secretary Walsingham</span> was of opinion, that letters of Mart or Reprizals would furnish the land with treasure, so that they went forth in Fleetes more strongly prepared then in <span class="hi">Queen Elizabeths</span> daies; For that now-a-dayes the <span class="hi">Pyrates of Algiere</span> had taught the <span class="hi">Spaniards</span> more wit not to go so weak­ly mand and stor'd as in times past. In <span class="hi">Drakes, Hau­kins,</span> and other braue Aduenturers voyages, our <span class="hi">English</span> found a <span class="hi">Golden age.</span> But that now the case was otherwise. Therefore they must goe strong, if they meane to surprize any rich Carricks. Like­wise he wished them, whose powers extended not to supply themselues with many Copartners, to watch about the lesser Ilands in <span class="hi">America,</span> and not to draw too neere those Forts where the Gallies frequēted, nor to be aduenturous about the time when the <span class="hi">Spanish Fleet</span> repaired thither. About <span class="hi">Brazill,</span> and the riuer of <span class="hi">Plate</span> hee supposed they might intercept good booties &amp; with more safe­ty: or if they entred into <span class="hi">Lameeres straights,</span> they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36418"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=19655&amp;page=182">[Page 78]</a></span> might in the <span class="hi">South sea</span> meet with rich prizes. Fur­ther, he animated the <span class="hi">East Indy Company</span> to ioyne with the <span class="hi">Hollanders</span> to driue the <span class="hi">Portingals</span> out of the wade of Spiceries. Further, he aduised the <span class="hi">En­glish</span> to prouide the like kinde entertainment for the <span class="hi">Spanish</span> prisoners, if not in their owne Coun­trey, yet in the <span class="hi">Summer Ilands,</span> and other <span class="hi">Plantati­ons</span> where they might be put to labour as well as they employ them in their Gallies, vntil they paid sufficient ransomes. Lastly, he counselled them to erect a speciall <span class="hi">society</span> of men of war to ioyne to­gether in the Nauall expedition, and to lend vpon reasonable considerations some of those shippes, which they tooke, to waft our Fishermen, and to defend the <span class="hi">Plantations.</span></p><p>Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Smith</span> protested, that there must be strait <span class="hi">Lawes</span> enacted against superfluous commo­dities imported into the land out of other Coun­treyes, before the <span class="hi">Golden Fleece</span> could possibly be­come the Catholike Restoratiue.
