AWay with Cupids idle Darts

what doth he mean I wonder,

He makes a ſtir with breaking hearts,

ſuch grief I'le ne'r lye under:

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be Jolly,

with me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair

which is not kind, and willing.

Some doating fools there is I know,

will cringe and bow to Beauty

And ſtand in fear of Cupids Bow,

as counting it their Duty:

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

to me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair

which is not kind and willing.

Let me enjoy the charming Bowl

of Liquor when in Seaſon,

It quickens e'ry Noble Soul,

and Ripens all our Reaſon;

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

with me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair

which is not kind and willing.

No Lo [...]ve no Life.

_[figure]_

Now fill the Glaſſes to the brim,

for this will paint our Faces,

And drink a full Carrouſe to him

that ſlights all fond embraces:

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

to me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair,

which is not kind and willing.

Fair Phillis once her Love did ſhow

to me, but once I loſt her,

I ſcorn'd the Tyrannizing Bow

of Cupid that Impoſtor:

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

with me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair,

which is not kind and willing.

Since Cupid uſes ſubtile Charms,

I ſcornfully beheld him,

I'le hugg the Bottle in my arms

now may the D —Geld him;

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

with me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair,

which is not kind and willing.

Now drink about and never ſpare,

reſolving to be merry,

No Phillis in the World more fair

then Glaſſes of Canary:

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

to me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair

which is not kind and willing.

Now he's an Aſs that ſeems to dote,

and waits a Womans Leiſure,

I'de have him learn to change his note

with us enjoy true pleaſure;

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

to me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair,

which is not kind and willing.

We'l lay our hearts a ſoak in Sack,

it is a cure for Sadneſs,

This Liquor never let us lack,

ſince too much Love is Madneſs;

Fond Love is a folly, Boys we'l be jolly,

to me it ſhan't be Killing,

Grand fools they are that counts her fair

which is not kind and willing.

I know there's few but love to ſport,

of all degrees I vow man,

From jovial Gallants at the Court,

to Country Ralph the Plow-man:

For he [...]l be jolly, with Hate and Molly,

who take delight in billing,

Grand fools they are who count her fair,

which is not kind and willing.
