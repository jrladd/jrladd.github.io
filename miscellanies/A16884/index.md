## TO THE RIGHT WOR­ſhipfull, Syr Thomas Moun­ſon, Knight.

ENgliſh Maecenas, bounties elder brother,

The ſpreading wing, whereby my fortune flies;

Vnto thy wit, and vertues, and none other,

I conſecrate theſe ſacred Poeſies.

Which whilſt they liue, (as they muſt liue for euer)

Shall giue thy honour life, and let men know,

That thoſe to ſuccour vertue who perſeuer,

Shall conquer time, and Laethes ouerflow.

[...]pickt theſe flowers of Learning from their ſtem,

Whoſe heauenly Wits & golden Pens haue chac't

Dull ignorance that long affronted them.

In view of whoſe great glories thou art plac't,

That whilſt their wiſdoms in theſe writings floriſh,

Thy fame may liue, whoſe wealth doth wiſedome noriſh.

Your Worſhips humbly at commaund. R. A.

## To the Reader.

I Hang no Iuie out to ſell my Wine,

The Nectar of good witts will ſell it ſelfe;

I feare not, what detraction can define,

I ſaile ſecure from Enuies ſtorme or ſhelfe.

I ſet my picture out to each mans vewe,

Limd with theſe colours, and ſo cunning arts,

That like the Phaenix will their age renewe,

And conquer Enuie by their good deſarts.

If any Cobler carpe aboue his ſhoo,

I rather pittie, then repine his action,

For ignorance ſtil maketh much adoo,

And wiſdom loues that, which offēds detrac­tion.

Go fearles forth my booke, hate cānot harm thee,

Apollo bred thee, & the Muſes arm thee.

R. A.

## 1\. THE CHOYSEST FLOW­ers of our Moderne Engliſh Poets.

### 1.1. Angels.

FAire is the heauen where happie ſoules haue place,

In full enioyment of felicitie,

Whence they do ſtill behold the glorious face

Of the diuine eternall maieſtie.

More faire is that where thoſe Idees on hie

Enraunged be, which Plato ſo admirde,

And pure intelligences from God inſpirde.

Yet fairer is that heauen, in which do raigne

The ſoueraigne powers and mightie Potentates,

Which in their hie protections do containe

All mortall Princes and imperiall ſtates.

And fairer yet, whereas the royall ſeats

And heauenly Dominations are ſet:

From whom all earthly gouernance is fet.

Yet farre more faire be thoſe bright Cherubins

Which all with golden wings are ouer dight,

And thoſe eternall burning Seraphins

Which from their faces dart out fiery light.

Yet fairer then they both, and much more bright

Be th' Angels and Archangels, which attend

On Gods owne perſon, without reſt or end.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 2]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=8)

The firſt compoſing of the number nine,

Which of all numbers is the moſt diuine,

From orders of the Angels doth ariſe,

Which be contained in three Hierarchies,

And each of theſe three Hierarchies in three,

The perfect forme of true felicitie:

And of the Hierarchies I ſpake of erſt,

The glorious Epiphania is the firſt,

In which the hie celeſtiall orders bin

Of Thrones, of Cherubs, and of Seraphin:

The ſecond holds the mightie Principates

The Ephionia, the third Hierarchie

With Vertues, Angels, and Archangels bee.

And thus by threes we aptly do define,

And do compoſe this ſacred number nine:

Yet each of theſe nine orders grounded be

Vpon ſome one particularitie.

M. Drayton.

Out of the Hierarchies of Angels ſheene,

The gentle Gabriell God cald from the reſt:

Twixt God and ſoules of men that righteous beene.

Embaſſador he is for euery bleſt.

The iuſt commands of heauens eternall king,

Twixt skies and earth he vp and downe doth bring.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

Our walls of fleſh that cloſe our ſoules, God knew how weak, and gaue

A further gard, euen euery man, an Angell guide to ſaue:

And men for vs be angels, while they work our ſouls to ſaue.

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

[[Page 3]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=8)

—If Angels fight

Weake men muſt fall, for heauen ſtil gards the right.

W. Shakeſpeare.

### 1.2. Ambition.

Ambition is a Vultur vile,

That feedeth on the heart of pride,

And finds no reſt when all is tride.

For worlds cannot confine the one,

Th'other liſts and bounds hath none.

And both ſubuert the mind, the ſtate

Procure deſtruction, enuy, hate.

S. Daniell.

Ambition, fie vpon thy painted cheeke,

(Woe worth the beautie ſleepes not with the face)

For thou art hatefull, foule, vnfaire, vnmeete:

A poyſon-painted pleaſure▪ mads men chaſe.

Thou reaſonleſſe deſire that makes men ſeeke

To kiſſe the ſame, whileſt fire doth thee imbrace.

Thou onely ſtrong diſordered, ruleſt paſſion,

Thou marſt mens minds, and pu [...]ſt them out of faſhiō.

I. Markham.

The golden chaine of Homers hie deuiſe

Ambition is, or curſed auarice:

Which all gods haling being tied to Ioue

Him from his ſetled height could neuer moue.

Intending this, that though that powerfull chaine

Of moſt Herculean vigor to conſtraine

Men from true vertue, or their preſent ſtates,

Attempt a man, that manleſſe changes hates:

And is enobled with a deathleſſe loue,

[[Page 4]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=9)Of things
eternall dignified aboue:

Nothing ſhall ſtirre him from adorning ſtill,

This ſhape with vertue and his power with will.

G. Chapman.

—The greedy thirſt of royall crowne

That knowes no kindred, nor regards no right,

Stird Porrex vp, to pluck his brother downe:

Who vnto him aſſembling forraine might,

Made warre on him, and fell himſelfe in fight:

Whoſe death to auenge his mother mercileſſe

Moſt merciles of women, Eden hight:

Her other ſonne faſt ſleeping did oppreſſe,

And with moſt cruell hand him murdred pittileſſe.

Ed. Spencer.

A diademe once dazeling the eie,

The day too darke, to ſee affinitie:

And where the arme is ſtretcht to reach a crowne,

Friendſhip is broke, the deareſt things thrown downe.

M. Drayton.

—Realme-rape, ſpareth neither kin nor friend.

I. Higgins. Mir. of Ma.

Who fight for crownes, ſet life, ſet all to light,

Who aime ſo hie, wil die, or hit the white.

Doctor Lodge.

One riſeth by an others fall, and ſome do clime ſo faſt,

That in the clouds they do forget what climats they haue paſt

W. Warner.

The Eagle minded minds that neſtle in the ſun,

Their lofty heads haue leaden heeles, and end where they be­gun.

Idem.

O, fatall is the aſcent vnto a crowne,

[[Page 5]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=9)From whēce
men come not down, but tumble downe

S. Daniell.

Like as the heauen two Sunnes cannot containe,

So in the earth two Kings cannot remaine

Of equall ſtate: ſo doth Ambition craue,

One King will not another equall haue.

Tho. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Whom ſo the mindes vnquiet ſtate vpheaues,

Be it for loue or feare; when fancie reaues

Reaſon her right, by mocking of the wit,

If once the cauſe of this affection flit,

Reaſon preuailing on the vnbrideled thought,

Downe falls he, who by fancie climbd aloft.

I. H. M. of Magiſt.

Deſire of rule within a climbing breſt

To breake a vowe, may beare the buckler beſt.

G. Gaſcoigne.

In ſome courts ſhall you ſee Ambition

Sit peecing Dedalus old waxen wings:

But being clapt on and they about to flie,

Euen when their hopes are buſied in the cloudes

They melt againſt the ſunne of maieſtie,

And downe they tumble to deſtruction.

Tho. Dekkar.

Better ſit ſtill men ſay then riſe and fall.

High ſtate the bed wherein misfortune lies.

Mars moſt vnfriendly, when moſt kind he ſeemes:

Who climeth hie on earth, he hardeſt lights,

And loweſt falles attends the higheſt flights.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

As higheſt hils with tempeſt be moſt touched,

[[Page 6]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=10)And tops of
trees moſt ſubiect vnto winde,

And as great Towers with ſtone ſtrongly couched,

Haue many falles when they be vnderminde,

Euen ſo by proofe in worldly things we finde,

That ſuch as climbe the top of hie degree,

From feare of falling neuer can be free.

I. H. M. of Magiſt.

Ambition with the Eagle loues to build,

Nor on the mountaine dreads the winter blaſt:

But with ſelfe ſoothing doth the humour guild

With arguments, correcting what is paſt.

Forecaſting kingdomes, dangers vnforecaſt:

Leauing this poore word of content to ſuch,

Whoſe earthly ſpirits haue not fiery tuch.

M. Drayton.

—The ambitious once inur'd to raigne,

Can neuer brooke a priuate ſtate againe.

S. Daniell.

—Warlike Caeſar tempted with the name

Of this ſweet Iſland neuer conquered,

And enuying the Britons blazed fame,

(O hideous hunger of dominion) hither came.

Ed. Spencer.

—Ambition

In princely pallace and in ſtately townes,

Doth often creep, and cloſe within conuaies

(To leaue behind it) damage and decaies:

By it be loue and amitie deſtroid.

It breakes the lawes, and common concord beates.

Kingdomes and realmes it topſie turuy turnes.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Be not ambitiouſly a king, nor grudgingly decline,

[[Page 7]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=10) One God did
roote out Cis his ſtock, and raiſe vp Ieſſes line.

VV. Warner.

The aſpirer once attain'd vnto the toppe,

Cuts off thoſe meanes by which himſelfe got vp.

S. Daniel.

Haughtie Ambition makes a breach in hills,

Runs drie by ſea amongſt the raging ſcills.

Th. Hud.

### 1.3. Affection.

Affection is a coale that muſt be coolde,

Elſe ſuffered, it will ſet the heart on fire,

The fire hath bounds, but deepe deſire hath none.

Ʋ Ʋ. Shakeſpeare.

Affection by the countenance is deſcri'de,

The light of hidden fier it ſelfe diſcouers,

And loue that is conceal'd, betraies poore Louers.

Th. Marlowe.

—Moſt wretched man,

That to affections doth the bridle lend,

In their beginning they are weake and wan,

But ſoone through ſufferance growe to fearefull end,

Whil'ſt they are weake, betime with them contend.

For when they once to perfect ſtrength do growe,

Strong warres they make, and cruell battrie bend,

Gainſt fort of reaſon, it to ouerthrowe.

Ed. Sp.

### 1.4. Affliction.

If ſo Affliction once her warre begin,

And threat the feeble ſenſe with ſword and fire,

The mind contracts her ſelfe and ſhrinketh in,

And to her ſelfe ſhe gladly doth retire.

[[Page 8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=11)As Spiders
toucht ſeeke their webbes in moſt part,

As Bees in ſtormes vnto their hiues returne,

As bloud in daunger gathers to the hart,

As men ſeeke townes when foes the country burne.

I. Dauies.

If ought can touch vs ought, afflictions lookes

(Make vs to looke into our ſelues ſo neare)

Teach vs to know our ſelues beyond all bookes,

Or all the learned ſchooles that euer were.

Idem.

This makes our ſenſes quicke and reaſon cleare,

Reſolues our will and rectifies our thought:

So do the winds and thunder clenſe the aire,

So working ſeas ſettle and purge the wine,

So lopt and pruned trees do flouriſh faire.

So doth the fire the droſſie gold refine.

I. Dauies.

### 1.5. Audacitie.

What need we creepe the croſſe to giue vnto a begging ſaint,

Tuſh, tuſh, a fig for booke loue, none be fortunate, that faint.

W. Warner.

Things out of hope are compaſt oft with ventering,

Chiefly in loue, whoſe leaue exceeds commiſſion:

Affection faints not like a pale fac'd coward,

But then woes beſt, when moſt his choice is froward.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Bluſhing and ſighing Theſeus neuer ſtroue

To wooe and winne Antiope his loue.

I. Weeuer.

—VVhen all is done that do we may,

Labour we ſorrowing all the night, and ſuing all the day,

[[Page 9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=11) The female
faultie cuſtome yeelds leſſe merit, greateſt pay:

And ventrous more then vertuous means doth bear the bel away.

W. Warner.

### 1.6. Art.

Art hath a world of ſecrets in her powers.

M. Drayton.

Art curbeth nature, nature guildeth Art.

I. Marston.

Things ſenceleſſe liue by Art, and rationall die,

By rude contempt of Art and induſtrie.

G. Chapman.

Art hath an enemy cald ignorance.

B. Iohnſon.

Arts periſh, wanting honour and applauſe.

D. Lodge.

— Arts beſt nurſe is honours chaſt deſire,

And glory ſets all ſtudious hearts on fire.

Tho. Storer.

Art muſt be wonne by art and not by might.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Valour and Art are both the ſonnes of Ioue,

Both brethren by the father not the mother:

Both peeres without compare, both liue in loue,

But Art doth ſeeme to be the elder brother,

Becauſe he firſt gaue life vnto the other.

Who afterward gaue life to him againe,

Thus each by other doth his life retaine.

Ch. Fitz. Ieffery.

Art is nobilities true regiſter,

Nobilitie Arts champion ſtill is ſaid:

Learning is fortitudes right calender,

[[Page 10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=12)And
fortitude is Learnings ſaint and aide,

Thus if the ballances twixt both bewaide,

Honour ſheelds Learning from all iniurie,

And Learning honour from blacke infamie.

Idem.

Vaine is the Art that ſeeks it ſelfe for to deceiue.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.7. Auarice.

— Greedie Auarice by him did ride,

Vpon a Camell loaden all with gold,

Two iron coffers hung on either ſide,

With precious mettall, full as they might hold:

And in his lap a heape of coyne he tolde,

For of his wicked pelfe his god he made,

And vnto hell, himſelfe for money ſolde

Accurſed vſurie was all his trade,

And right and wrong alike in equall ballance waied.

Ed. Spencer.

Forth of a Deſart wood an vgly beaſt

There ſeem'd to come, whoſe ſhape was thus defined,

Eares of an Aſſe, a Wolfe in head and breaſt,

A carkaſſe all with pinching famine pined,

A Lyons griſly iawe, but all the reſt

To fox-like ſhape did ſeeme to be enclined,

In England, France, in Italy and Spaeine,

Yea all the world this monſter ſeem'd to raine,

Where ere this cruell monſter ſet his foote,

He kild and ſpoyld of euery ſort and ſtate:

No height of birth or ſtate with him did boote

He conquered Kings and crownes all in like rate.

Yea this beaſts power had tane ſo deep a roote,

[[Page 11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=12)It entred in
Chriſts Vicars ſacred gate,

And vexed Cardinalls and Biſhops chiefe,

And bred a ſcandall euen in our beliefe.

S. I. Harr.

Python whom Phoebus kil'd with thouſand darts,

Was monſter leſſe then this by thouſand parts.

Idem.

Eriphilaes Armor.

In vaine it were for to declare in Verſe,

How ſumptuouſly her armour all was wrought,

All ſet with ſtones, and ſet with Indian Gold,

Perfect for vſe, and pleaſant to behold.

Mounted ſhe was, but not vpon a ſteede,

In ſtead whereof, ſhe on a Wolfe did ſit:

A Wolfe whoſe match Apulia doth not breede,

Taught to obey, although ſhe vs'de no bit.

And all of ſandy colour was her weede,

Her armes were this, for ſuch a Champion fit,

An vgly toade was painted on her ſhield,

With poyſon ſwolne, and in a ſable field.

Idem.

—Auarice, all arm'd in hooking  [...]enters,

All clad in birdlime, without bridge ſhe venters,

Through fell Charibdis and falſe Syrtes Neſſe,

The more her wealth, the more her wretchedneſſe,

Cruell, reſpectleſſe, friendleſſe, faithleſſe elſe,

Thoſe foule baſe figures in each dunghill poole,

Like Tantalus ſtaru'd in the midſt of ſtore,

Not that ſhe hath, but what ſhe wants ſhe counts,

A well-wing'd Bird, that neuer loftie mounts.

I. Syluister. Tranſl.

[[Page 12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=13)

Regard of worldly mucke doth fowly blend,

And lowe abaſe the hie heroike ſpirit,

That ioyes for crownes and kingdomes to contend.

Ed. Spencer.

We aged carke to liue, and leaue an ouerplus in ſtore,

Perhaps for ſpend-alls: ſo amidſt abundance liue we pore.

W. Warner.

Thoſe which much couet, are with gaine ſo fond,

That what they haue not that which they poſſeſſe:

They ſcatter and vnlooſe from their bond.

And ſo by hoping more, they haue but leſſe,

Or gaining more, the profit of exceſſe

Is but to ſurfet, and ſuch griefes ſuſtaine,

That they proue banckrout in this pore rich vaine.

VV. Shakespeare.

Thoſe that will all deuour, muſt all forgoe.

Tho. Dekkar.

Cōtent thee with vnthreatned mean, & play not Aeſops dog

The gold that gētle Bacchus gaue, did greedy Mydas clog:

Commit not treaſure with thy child to greedy minded men,

Thou leaueſt Polydor a ſpoile to Polymneſtor then.

VV. Ʋ Ʋarner.

### 1.8. Beautie.

—Sacred Beautie is the fruit of ſight,

That curteſie that ſpeakes before the toong:

The feaſt of ſoules, the glory of the light,

Enuy of age, and euerlaſting yoong:

Pitties commaunder, Cupids richeſt throne,

Muſicke entraunced, neuer duly ſung:

The ſumme and court of all proportion.

And that I may dull ſpeeches leaſt afford,

Rhethorickes Flowers, in leſſe then in a word.

G. Chapman.

— Bewtie borne of heauenly race.

Bewtie (daughter of maruaile) ô ſee how

Thou canſt diſgracing ſorrowes ſweetly grace,

What power thou ſhew'ſt in a diſtreſſed browe,

That mak'ſt affliction faire giu'ſt teares their grace.

What? can vntreſſed locks, can torne rent haire?

A weeping eye, a wailing face be faire?

I ſee then artleſſe feature can content,

And that true Bewtie needs no ornament.

S. Daniell.

— Bewtie is the bait which with delight

Doth man allure for to enlarge his kinde,

Bewtie the burning lampe of heauens light,

Darting her beames into each feeble minde,

Againſt whoſe power, nor God nor man can finde

Defence, reward, the daunger of the wound:

[...]ut being hurt, ſeeke to be medicinde,

Of her that firſt did ſtirre that mortall wound.

Ed. Spencer.

— Bewtie is womans golden crowne,

Mans conquereſſe and feminine renowne:

[...]ot ioind with loue, who deare yet euer ſold it?

[...]or bewties cheape, except loues eye behold it.

I. Weeuer.

— Bewtie is an adamant to all.

[...]ewtie, natures Iuie-buſh each paſſenger doth call.

W. Warner.

[...]eldome wants gueſts where Bewtie bids the feaſt,

[...]ens eyes with wonders nere are ſatisfied,

[[Page 14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=14)At faireſt
ſignes beſt welcome is ſurmiſed,

The ſhrine of loue doth ſeldome offring want,

Nor with ſuch counſell, clients neuer ſcant.

M. Drayton.

All Orators are dumbe where Bewtie pleadeth.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Bewtie it ſelfe doth of it ſelfe perſwade

The eyes of men, without an Orator?

What needeth then Apollogies be made,

To ſet forth that which is ſo ſingular?

Idem.

Nought vnder heauen ſo ſtrongly doth allure

The ſenſe of man, and all his minde poſſeſſe,

As Bewties louely bate that doth procure

Great warriors oft their rigor to repreſſe,

And mightie hands forget their manlineſſe.

Driuen with the power of an heart-robbing eye,

And wrapt in flowers of a golden treſſe.

That can with melting pleaſance mollifie,

Their hardned hearts enur'd to bloud and crueltie.

Ed. Spencer.

O how can bewtie maiſter the moſt ſtrong,

And ſimple truth ſubdue auenging wrong?

Idem.

No armour can be found that can defend,

Tranſpercing raies of chriſtall pointed eyes.

S. Daniell.

Hard is that heart which Bewtie makes not ſoft.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

[[Page 15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=14)

— Who ſo young that loues not?

Or who ſo olde that womens Bewtie moues not?

W. Weeuer.

A ſparke of Bewtie burns a world of men.

Idem.

O what is Bewtie if it be not ſeene?

Or what is't to be ſeene and not admir'd,

And though admir'd, vnleſſe in loue deſir'd.

Neuer were cheekes of Roſes locks of Amber,

Ordain'd to liue impriſoned in a Chamber.

S. Daniell.

Nature created Bewtie for the view,

(Like as the fire for heate, the Sun for light)

The faire do euer hold this pledge as due,

By auntient charter to liue moſt in ſight,

As ſhe that is debar'd it, hath not right:

In vaine our friends from this do vs dehort,

For Bewtie will be where is moſt reſort.

Idem.

All excellence of ſhape is made for ſight,

To be a beetle elſe were no defame:

Hid Bewties loſe their ends, and wrong their right.

G. Chapman.

Heauen made bewtie like her ſelfe to viewe,

Not to be lapt vp in a ſmoakie mewe:

A roſie tainted feature is heauens golde,

Whil'ſt all men ioy to touch, all to behold.

M. Drayton.

The ripeſt corne dies if it be not reapt,

Bewtie alone is loſt too early kept.

Ch. Marlowe.

[[Page 16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=15)

It hath bene through all ages euer ſeene,

That with the praiſe of armes and chiualrie,

The praiſe of Bewtie ſtill hath ioyned beene,

And that for reaſons ſpeciall priuitie,

For either doth on other much relie,

For he me ſeemes moſt fitteſt is to ſerue,

That can her beſt defend from villanie,

And ſhe moſt fit his ſeruice doth deſerue,

That faireſt is, and from her faith doth neuer ſwarue.

Ed. Spencer.

— Bewtie is more bright and cleare.

The more it is admir'd of many a wight,

And nobleſt ſhe that ſerued is of noble Knight.

Idem.

Rich Bewtie, that each Louer labours for,

Tempting as heapes of new coynd glowing Golde,

(Rackt of ſome miſerable treaſurer,)

Drawes his deſires, and them in chaines enfold,

Vrging him ſtill to tell it and conceale it:

But Bewties treaſure neuer can be tolde,

None can peculiar ioy, yet all muſt ſteale it.

O Bewtie, this ſame bloodie ſiege of thine,

Starues me that yeeld, and feeds me till I pine.

G. Chapman.

O Bewtie, ſtill thy Empire ſwims in blood,

And in thy peace, warre ſtores himſelfe with foode.

Idem.

O Bewtie Syrene faire enchaunting good,

Sweete ſilent Rhethoricke of perſwading eyes:

Dumbe eloquence, whoſe power doth moue the blood

More then the workes, or wiſedome of the wiſe.

[[Page 17]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=15)Still
harmony whoſe Diapazon lies

Within a brow, the key which paſſions moue

To rauiſh the ſence and play a world in loue.

S. Daniell.

Beautie enchaſing loue, loue gaining Beautie,

To ſuch as conflict Sympathies enfold:

To perfect riches doth a ſounder dutie

Then all endeuours, for by all conſent

All wealth and wiſedome reſts in time content.

More force and art is beautie ioynd with loue,

Then thrones with wiſedom, ioyes of them compoſde,

Are armes more proofe gainſt any griefe we proue:

Then all their vertue ſcorning miſerie,

Or iudgements graue in ſtoicke grauitie.

G. Chapman.

Beautie a begger, fieit is too bad

When in it ſelfe ſufficiencie is had:

It was not made to pleaſe the wandring eie,

But an attire to adorne ſweet modeſtie.

If modeſtie and women once do ſeuer,

Farwell our fame, farwell our name for euer.

M. Drayton.

O Beautie that betraies thy ſelfe to euery amorous eie,

To trap thy proud profeſſors, what is it but wantons trie?

Ʋ Ʋhere through it ſildom haps the faire from mean deceits to flie.

W. Warner.

This Beautie faire, is an inchauntment made

By natures witchcraft, tempting men to buie

With endleſſe ſhowes, what endleſly will fade,

Yet promiſe chapmen all eternitie.

But like to goods ill got a fault it hath,

[[Page 18]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=16)Brings men
inricht therewith to beggery,

Vnles the enricher be as rich in faith

Enamourd, (like god ſelfe-loue) with her owne

Seene in an other then tis heauen alone.

G. Chapman.

—Beautie is a baine

To ſuch as feed their fancy with fond loue,

That when ſweet youth with luſt is ouerthrowne,

It rues in age.

R. Greene.

Where Venus ſtrikes with Beautie to the quicke,

It little vailes ſafe reaſon to apply:

Fewe are the cares for ſuch as are loue ſicke,

But loue.

Idem.

Truce, warre, and woe, do wait at Beauties gate,

Time loſt, laments, reports and priuie grudge:

And laſt, fierce loue is but a partiall iudge,

Who yeelds for ſeruice ſhame, for friendſhip hate.

D. Lodge.

The bees of Hybla haue beſides ſweet hony ſmarting ſtings,

And beauty doth not want a bait that to repentance brings.

W. Warner.

—Faire colours ſooneſt ſoyle,

Things of beſt price are ſubiect moſt to ſpoyle.

Ch. Middleton.

The fairer cheeke hath oftentimes a ſoule

Leprous as ſin it ſelfe, then hell more foule.

Th. Dekkar.

All men do erre, becauſe that men they bee,

And men with Beautie blinded, cannot ſee.

G. Peele.

[[Page 19]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=16)

Beautie, heauen and earth this grace doth win,

It ſupples rigor, and it leſſons ſin.

G. Chapman.

Nought is vnder heauens wide hollownes,

That moues more deare compaſſion of mind:

Then Beautie to vnworthy wretchednes

Through enuies ſnares, or fortunes freakes vnkind.

Ed. Spencer.

—Nothing ill becomes the faire,

But crueltie which yeelds vnto no praier.

S. Daniell.

Like as the Sun in a Diameter

Fires and inflames obiects remoued far,

And heateth kindly, ſhining laterally,

So Beautie ſweetly quickens when tis nie:

But being ſeperated and remoued,

Burnes where it's cheriſht, murders where it loued.

Ch. Marlowe.

Simples fit Beautie, fie on drugs and art.

M. Drayton.

—Faire words and powre-attractiue bewtie,

Bring men to want on in ſubiectiue dutie.

I. Weeuer.

—Wayward Beauty doth not fancy moue.

A frowne forbids, a ſmile ingendreth loue.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

—What els is forme, but fading aire?

Yea oft, becauſe aſſaulted of, it hurteth to be faire.

VV. Ʋ Ʋarner.

Full ſoone the faireſt face would ceaſe from being ſuch,

If not preſerued curiouſly from tendring more then much

[[Page 20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=17)That
wondrous patterne where ſoeuer it bee

Whether in earth laid vp in ſecret ſtore,

Or els in heauen that no man may it ſee

With ſinfull eies, for feare it to deflore:

Is perfect Beautie which all men adore.

Whoſe face and feature doth ſo far excell

All mortall ſence, that none the ſame may tell.

Ed. Spencer.

O Beautie, how attractiue is thy power?

For as the liues heat clings about the hart,

So all mens hungry eyes do haunt thy bower:

Raigning in Greece, Troy ſwumme to thee in art.

Remoued to Troy, Greece followed thee in feares,

Thou dreweſt ech ſyreleſſe ſword, ech childleſſe dart

And puldſt the Towers of Troy about thine eares.

G. Chapman.

### 1.9. Varietie of Beauties.

The harbingers of luſt his amorous eyes did walke,

More clogd with chāge of Beauties thē K. Midas once wit [...] gold

Now this, now that, and one by one he did them all behold.

This ſeemed faire, & that as faire, and letting either paſſe,

A third he thought a proper girle, a fourth, a pleaſant laſſe.

Louely the fift, liuely the ſixt, the ſeuenth a louely wench,

The eight of ſweet complexion, to the ninth he altereth thē  [...]

That mildly ſeem'd maieſticall, tenth modeſt lookes & toong

The eleuenth could ſweetly entertain, the twelft was freſh & yoong

The next a gay brownetta, next admir'd & yoong.

And euery feature ſo intic't his intricate affection,

As liking, all alike, he lou'd confounded in election.

W. Ʋ Ʋarner.

[[Page 21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=17)

### 1.10. Baniſhment.

No Baniſhment can be to him aſsignde,

Who doth retaine a true reſolued minde.

M. Drayton.

[...]n exile, euery man or bond or free

Of noble race, or meaner parentage:

[...]s not in this vnlike vnto the ſlaue

That muſt of force obey to each mans will,

And praiſe the peeuiſhneſſe of each mans pride.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

### 1.11. Baſhfulneſſe.

—So reſpected

Was Baſhfulneſſe in Athens it erected

To chaſt Agneia, which is ſhamefaſtneſſe

A ſacred temple, holding her a goddeſſe.

G. Chapman.

Preferment ſildome graceth Baſhfulneſſe.

Idem.

Let ſoberneſſe be ſtill thy wiſedomes end,

Admitting what thou canſt not comprehend.

I. Sylueſter. Tranſl.

### 1.12. Bliſſe.

Theſe dayes example hath deep written here

Deep written in my heart with yron pen,

That Bliſſe may not abide in ſtate of mortall men.

Ed. Spencer.

Doth ſorrow fret thy ſoule? ô direfull ſpirit,

Doth pleaſure feed thy heart? ô bleſſed man.

Haſt thou bene happie once? ô heauy plight.

[[Page 22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=18)Are thy
miſhaps forepaſt? ô happie than:

Or haſt thou bliſſe in eld? ô bliſſe too late:

But haſt thou bliſſe in youth? ô ſweet eſtate.

E. of O.

—Hard it is

To immitate a falſe and forged bliſſe,

Ill may a ſad mind forge a mery face,

Nor hath conſtrained laughter any grace.

G. Chapman.

—Bliſſe not in height doth dwell.

Idem.

—Quiet Bliſſe in no ſtate laſteth long.

Aſſailed ſtill by miſchiefe many waies,

Whoſe ſpoyling battery glowing hote and ſtrong,

No flowing wealth, no force nor wiſdome ſtaies.

Her ſmoakeleſſe powder, beaten ſouldiers ſlaies.

By open force, foule miſchiefe oft preuailes:

By ſecret ſleight, ſhe ſild her purpoſe failes.

I. H. of Magiſt.

Bleſſed the man that well can vſe his bliſſe.

Ed. Spencer.

We think no greater bliſſe, then ſuch to be, as be we would,

When bleſſed none, but ſuch as be, the ſame, as be they ſhould▪

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

Our bliſſe conſiſts not in poſſeſsions,

But in commaunding our affections.

In vertues choyce, and vices needfull chace,

Far from our harts for ſtaining of our face.

Tho. Kid.

[[Page 23]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=18)

### 1.13. Bountie.

O ſacred Bountie, mother of content,

Proppe of renowne, nouriſher of Arts:

The crowne of hope, the roote of good euent,

The trumpe of fame, the ioy of noble hearts,

Grace of the heauens, diuinitie in nature,

Whoſe excellence doth ſo adorne the creature,

M. Drayton.

— On the other part was to be viewde

His vertues, each one by it ſelfe diſtinct,

Prudence and temperance,, and Fortitude,

And Iuſtice, and a fift vnto theſe linckt

So nie, that who with it is not indued?

The reſt may ſeeme blotted, or quite extinct,

Bountie, employed in giuing and in ſpending,

A ſpeciall grace to all the other lending.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Auguſtus Caeſar was not ſuch a Saint,

As Ʋirgill maketh him by his deſcription,

His loue of learning ſcuſeth that complaint,

That men might iuſtly make of his proſcription [...]

Neither the ſhame that Neroes name doth taint,

Confirm'd now by a thouſand yeares preſcription,

Be e'ne as it is, if he had had the wit,

To haue bene franke to ſuch as Poems writ,

Idem.

— This reaſon is the chiefe,

That wits decay becauſe they want their hire,

For where no ſuccour is, nor no reliefe,

The very beaſts will from ſuch place retire.

Idem.

[[Page 24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=19)—He is mad
and worſe,

That plaies the nigard with a Princes purſe.

M. Drayton.

### 1.14. Care.

—Another ſhape appeares

Of greedy Care ſtill bruſhing vp the knees,

His knuckles knobd, his fleſh deep dented in:

With tawed hands, and hardy tanned skin,

The morrow gray no ſooner hath begun

To ſpred his light, euen peeping in our eies,

When he is vp and to his worke yrunne,

But let the nights black miſtie mantels riſe,

And with foule darke neuer ſo much diſguiſe

The faire bright day, yet ceaſeth he no where,

But hath his candles to prolong his toyle.

M. Sackuill.

Rude was his garment, and to rags all rent,

No better had he, ne for better carde:

With bliſtered hands among the cynders brent,

And fingers filthy, with long nayles vnpared,

Right for to rend the food on which he fared.

His name was Care; a black Smyth by his trade:

That neither day nor night from working ſpared.

But to ſmall purpoſe yron wedges made,

Thoſe be vnquiet thoughts, that woful minds inuade.

Ed. Spencer.

Care keepes his watch in euery olde mans eye,

And where Care lodges, ſleepe will neuer lie:

[[Page 25]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=19)But where
vnbruiz'd youth with vnſtuft braine

Doth couch his limbs, there golden ſleepe doth raine.

W. Shakespeare.

Care and ſuſpition are faire Bewties dower.

M. Drayton.

Care the conſuming canker of the minde,

The diſcord that diſorders ſweet-hearts tune,

Th'abortiue baſtard of a coward minde,

The lightfoote lackie that runnes poſte by death,

Bearing the leters which containe our end:

The buſie aduocate that ſells his breath,

Denouncing worſt to him is moſt his frend,

H. Conſtable.

### 1.15. Charitie.

[...]he was a woman in the freſheſt age,

Of wondrous bewtie, and of bowntie rare,

With goodly grace, and comely perſonage,

That was on earth not eaſie to compare,

[...]ull of great loue; But Cupids wanton ſnare

As hel ſhe hated, chaſte in worke and will,

Her necke and breſt were euer open bare,

That aye thereof her babes might ſucke their fill,

The reſt was all in yealow robes araied ſtill.

A multitude of babes about her hung,

Playing their ſportes that ioyed her to behold,

Whom ſtill ſhe fed, while they were weake and yoong,

But thruſt them forth ſtill as they waxed old,

And on her head ſhe wore a tyre of gold:

[[Page 26]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=20)Adorn'd with
Gems and Owches wondrous faire,

Whoſe paſſing price vnneath was to be told,

And by her ſide there ſate a gentle paire

Of Turtle-doues, ſhe ſitting in an Iuorie chaire,

Ed. Spencer.

Due Charitie in louing doth preferre,

Her neighbours good, fore her vtilitie.

I. Syluister. Tranſl.

Who may but will not helpe, doth hurt we know, and curious they,

That dribling alms by art, diſband wel mēt frō wel done pay,

And he that queſtions diſtreſſe and doth not help endeuour,

Thē he that ſees & nothing ſaies, or cares is leſſe deceauour▪

W. Warner.

It is a worke of Charitie God knowes,

The reconcilement of two mortall foes.

Ch. Middleton.

—Charitie brings forrh but barren ſeeds,

And hatred ſtill is ſowne in ſo great ſtore,

That when the fruites of both came to be reaped,

The tone is ſcarce, the tother ouerheaped.

S. I. Harr.

### 1.16. Chastitie.

O Chaſtitie the chiefe of heauenly lights,

Which mak'ſt vs moſt immortall ſhape to wear [...],

S. Ph. Sidney.

—Chaſtities attire,

The vnſtained vaile which innocents adorne,

Th'vngather'd roſe defended with the thorne.

S. Daniel.

[[Page 27]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=20)

O Charitie, the gift of bleſſed ſoules,

Comfort in death, a crowne vnto the life:

Which all the paſſions of the minde controlles,

Adornes the maide, and bewtifies the wife,

That grace, the which nor death, nor time attaints.

Of earthly creatures making heauenly Saints.

M. Drayton.

— A Woman cannot take vpon her,

With bewtie, riches, nor with hie nobilitie,

To claime the true deſerued praiſe of honour,

If Chaſtitie do faile by her fragilitie,

This is the vertue that defends her honour.

S, I. Harrington.

Who doth deſire that chaſte his wife ſhould bee,

Firſt be he true, for truth doth truth deſerue,

Then he be ſuch as he his words may ſee,

And alwaies one credit, which her preſerue

Not toying kind, nor cauſleſly vnkinde.

Not ſtirring thoughts, nor yet denying right,

Not ſpying faults, nor in plaine errors blinde,

Neuer  [...]ard hand, nor euer raines to light,

As farre from want, as farre from vaine exſpence:

Th'one doth enforce, th'other doth entice,

All owe good company, but driue from thence

All filthy mouthes that glory in their vice.

This done, thou haſt no more, but leaue the reſt

To nature, fortune, time, and womans breſt.

S. Ph. Sydney.

Penelope in ſpending chaſte her daies,

As worthy as Vliſſes was of praiſe.

S. I. Harrington.

[[Page 28]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=21)

### 1.17. Of Christ.

The brooſer of the ſerpents head, the womans promiz'd ſeed

The ſecond in the Trinitie, the foode our ſoules to feed.

The vine the light, the doore the way, the ſhepheard of vs al,

Whoſe manhood ioynd to deitie, did raunſome vs from thrall

That was and is, and euermore will be the ſame to his,

That ſleeps to none, that wakes to him, that turns our curſe to blis,

Whō yet vnſeen the Patriarks ſaw, the Prophets had foretold

The Apoſtles preacht, the Saints adord, & Martyrs do be­hold

The ſame (Auguſtus Emperor) in Paleſtine was born

Amōgst his own, & yet his own did curſe their blis in ſcorn,

W. Warner.

Auguſtus quailing Anthonie, was Emperour alone,

In whoſe vnfoed monarchy our common health was knowne

The bruizer of the ſerpents head, the womans promiſd ſeed

The ſecond in the Trinitie, the foode our ſoules to feede.

The vine the light, the doore the way, the ſhepheard of vs all,

The ſame (Auguſtus Emperor) in Paleſtine was borne,

Amōgſt his own, & yet his own did curſe their blis in ſcorn

Idem.

### 1.18. Children.

Riches of children paſſe a princes throne,

Which touch the fathers heart with ſecret ioy.

When without ſhame he ſaith, theſe be mine owne.

S. Ph. Sidney.

This patterne good or ill our children get,

For what they ſee, their parents loue or hate,

Their firſt caught ſence prefers to teachers blowes,

The cockerings cockerd, we bewaile too late,

[[Page 29]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=21)When that we
ſee our ofſpring gayly bent,

Women man-wood, and men effeminate.

Idem.

— What children apprehend,

The ſame they like, they followe and amend.

D. Lodge.

There is no loue may be compa'rd to that,

The tender mother beares vnto the childe,

For euen ſo much the roote it doth encreaſe,

As their griefe growes, our contentation ceaſe.

G. Gaſ.

### 1.19. Chaunge.

All is but fained, and which oaker died,

That euery ſhowre will waſh and wipe away,

All things do Chaunge that vnder heauen abide,

And after death, all friendſhip doth decay,

Therefore what euer man bear'ſt worldly ſway

Liuing, on God and on thy ſelfe relie,

For when thou dieſt, all ſhall with thee die.

Ed. Spencer.

All ſuffer Chaunge, our ſelues new borne euen then begin to die.

W. Warner.

—The euer Chaunging courſe of things,

Runne a perpetuall circle, euer turning.

S. Dan.

Change liues not long, time fainteth, and time mourns,

Solace and ſorrow haue their certaine turnes.

M. Drayton.

All Chaunge is perillous, and all chaunce vnſound.

Ed. Spencer.

—Seldome Chaunge the better brought,

Content who liues with tried ſtate,

Need feare no Chaunge of frowning Fate:

[[Page 30]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=22)But will
ſeeke for vnknowne gaine,

Oft liues by loſſe, and leaues with paine.

Idem.

What doth remaine to man that can continue long?

What ſun cāſhine ſo cleare, but clouds may riſe amōg?

G. Gaſcoigne.

No flower is ſo freſh, but froſt can it deface,

No man ſo ſnre in any ſeate, but he may looſe his place

Idem.

Moſt true it is, as we doo daily proue.

No good nor ill, can ſtand ſtill at one ſtay.

S. I. Harrington.

The man that of himſelfe is moſt ſecure,

Shall finde himſelfe moſt fickle and vnſure.

Ed. Spencer.

Men change the ayre, but ſeldome change their care.

M. Drayton.

### 1.20. Chaunce.

What ſhould we thinke of ſignes? they are but haps,

How may they then be ſignes of after-claps?

Doth euery Chaunce foreſhew, or cauſe ſome other?

Or ending of it ſelfe, extend no further?

As th'ouerflowing flood ſome mount doth choake,

But to his guide, ſome othet flood it yoake,

So if that ſignes thy ſinnes once ioyne, beware

Elſe-whereto Chaunces tend do neuer care.

M. of M.

True it is if fortune light by Chaunce,

There fortune healpes the boldeſt to aduance.

G. Gaſcoigne.

[[Page 31]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=22)

### 1.21. Counſaile.

Sacred Counſaile, true heart ſuppling balme,

Soule-curing plaiſter, true preſeruing blis,

Water of life in euery ſudden qualme,

The heauens rich ſtore-houſe, where all treaſure is.

True guide, by whom foule errors due we mis,

Night burning-beacon watch, againſt miſhaps,

Foreſight, auoyding many after claps,

M. Drayton.

— Euery ſtrawe proues fewell to the fire,

When Counſell doth concurre with our deſire.

Idem.

What eld hath tried and ſeeene good counſell is.

D. Lodge.

— Counſell ſtill is one.

When fathers, friends, and worldly goods are gone.

Idem.

Counſell that comes when ill hath done his worſt,

Bleſſeth our ill, but makes our good accurſt.

M. Drayton.

Vaine ſounds of pleaſure we delight to heare▪

But Counſell iarres as diſcord in our eare.

Idem.

A King that aimes his neighbours crowne to win,

Before the fruite of open warres begin,

Corrupts his Counſell, with rich recompences,

For in good Counſell ſtands the ſtrength of Princes.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

A Kingdomes greatneſſe hardly can he ſway,

That wholſome Counſell did not firſt obey.

M. Dr.

[[Page 32]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=23)

Euen as by culling fruitefull Vines encreaſe,

So faithfull counſailes worke a Princes peace.

D. Lodge.

### 1.22. Concord.

— Concord,

Mother of bleſſed peace and friendſhip true,

They both her twins, both borne of heauenly ſeed,

The which her words diuine right well do ſhewe,

For ſtrength and wealth, and happineſſe ſhe lendes,

And ſtrife, and warre and anger does ſubdue,

Of little, much, of foes ſhe maketh frendes,

And to afflicted mindes, ſweet reſt and quiet ſends.

Ed. Spencer.

The richeſt Iewell of all heauenly treaſure,

That euer yet vnto the earth was ſhowne,

Is perfect Concord, th'onely perfect pleaſure,

That wretched earth-borne men haue euer knowne▪

For many hearts it doth compound in one,

That what ſo one doth, will, or ſpeake, or doo,

With one conſent, they all agree there too.

I. Dauies.

By her the heauen is in his courſe containd,

And all the world in ſtate vnmoued ſtands:

As their almightie maker firſt ordaind,

And bound them with inuiolable bands,

Elſe would the waters ouerflowe the lands,

And fire deuoure the water, and hell them quite,

But ſhe them holds with her all-bleſſed hands,

She is the nurſe of pleaſure and delight

And vnto Princes grace the gates doth open right.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 33]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=23)

O bleſſed concord bred in ſecret breſt

Of him that guides the reſtleſſe rolling skie:

That to the earth for mans aſſured reſt,

From height of heauens vouchſafeſt once to flie:

In thee alone the mightie power doth lie.

With ſweet accord to keep the frowne ſtarres,

And euery Planet els from hurtfull warres.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

When tract of time returnes the luſtie Ver,

By thee alone the buds and bloſſomes ſpring:

The fields with flowers be garniſh [...] eu'ry where,

The blooming trees aboundant leaues do bring,

The cheerfull birds melodiouſly do ſing.

Thou doeſt appoint the crop of ſommers ſeed

For mans reliefe, to ſerue his winter need.

Idem.

### 1.23. Conſcience.

—Within the ports and iawes of hell,

Sate deep remorſe of Conſcience, all beſprent

With teares: and to her ſelfe oft would ſhe tell

Her wretchednes, and curſing neuer ſtent

To ſob and ſigh, but euer thus lament

With thoughtfull care, as ſhe that all in vaine

VVould were and waſt continually in paine:

Her eyes vnſtedfaſt rolling in her head:

Whurld on ech place, as place that vengeance broght,

So was her mind continually in feare,

Toſſed and tormented with tedious thought

Of thoſe deteſted crimes which ſhe had wrought.

With dreadfull lookes and cheare throwne to the skie,

[[Page 34]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=24)Wiſhing for
death, and yet ſhe could not die.

M. Sackuill.

So gnawes the griefe of Conſcience euermore,

And in the heart it is ſo deeply graue

That they may neither ſleepe nor reſt therefore:

Ne thinke one thought, but on the dread they haue,

Sill to the death ſore toſled with the waue

Of reſtleſſe woe, in terror and diſpaire

They lead a life continually in feare.

Idem.

The feare of Conſcience entreth yron walles.

M. Drayton.

No armour proofe againſt the Conſcience terror.

Idem.

A guiltie conſcience neuer is ſecure,

Idem.

No meanes at all to hide

Man from himſelf can find

No way to ſtart aſide,

Out from the hell of mind,

But in himſelf confinde,

He ſtill ſees ſin before,

And winged footed paine

That ſwiftly comes behind

The which is euermore

The ſure and certain gaine

Impietie doth get,

And wanton boaſt reſpect,

That doth himſelfe forget.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 35]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=24)

Like to the Deare that ſtriken with the dart

Withdrawes himſelfe into ſome ſecret place,

And feeling griefe the wound about his hart,

Startles with pangs till he fall on the graſſe,

And in great feare lies gaſping there a ſpace.

Forth braying ſighes, as though each pang had brought

The preſent death which he doth dread ſo oft.

So we deep wounded with the bloudy thought

And gnawing worme that greeu'd our conſcience ſo,

Neuer tooke eaſe but as our heart out brought:

The ſtrained ſighes in witneſſe of our wo.

Such reſtleſſe cares our fault do well be know,

Wherewith with our deſerued fall, the feares,

In euery place rang death within our eares.

M. Sackuill.

—Looſe Conſcience is free

From all Conſcience what els hath libertie:

As't pleaſd the Thracian Boreas to blow,

So turnes our weary Conſcience too and fro.

I. Marſton.

Kings but the Conſcience all things can defend.

M. Drayton.

Whē as thou feel'ſt thy cōſcience toucht with greefe,

Thy ſelfe purſues thy ſelfe, both robd, and theefe.

Idem.

—Many with the Conſcience of the crime

[...]n colder blood will curſe what they deſignde:

And bad ſucceſſe vpbraiding their ill fact,

Drawes them, that others draw from ſuch an act.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 36]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=25)

### 1.24. Craft. Deceit. Fraud.

What man ſo wiſe, what earthly wit ſo ware,

As to deſcry the craftie cunning traine

By which Deceit doth maske in vizard faire:

And caſt her colours died deep in graine,

To ſeeme like truth, whoſe ſhape ſhe well can faine,

And fitting geſtures to her purpoſe frame,

The guiltleſſe mind with guile to entertaine.

Ed. Spencer.

Fraud ſhowd in comely cloathes a louely looke,

An humble caſt of eye, a ſober pace:

And ſo ſweet ſpeech, a man might her haue tooke

For him that ſaid haile Mary full of grace:

But all the reſt deformedly did looke,

As full of filthineſſe and foule diſgrace:

Hid vnder long large garments that ſhe ware,

Vnder the which, a poyſoned knife ſhe bare.

S. I. H.

Oft Craft can cauſe the man to make a ſeeming ſhow

Of hart, with dolor all diſtaind, where grief doth neue [...] grow▪

S. T. B.

—Craft wrapt ſtill in many comberments,

With all her cunning thriues not though it ſpeed.

S. Daniell.

Craft findes a key to open euery doore.

M. Dr.

### 1.25. Conqueſt.

Who hopes a conqueſt, leaues no conqueſt ſought.

M. Drayton.

Tis much to conquer, but to keep poſſeſſion

Is full as much, and if it be not more.

I. Sylueſter. tran [...]

[[Page 37]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=25)

To win the field againſt our armed foes,

Is counted honourable any waies,

Whether it be with pollicie or blowes:

Yet bloodie conquēſt ſtaines the Captaines praiſe.

But chiefeſt honour doth belong to thoſe

Whom fortune to ſuch height of hap doth raiſe,

To haue their foes ſuppreſt and ouerthrowne,

With little loſſe and daring of their owne.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Whereas proud conqueſt keepeth all in awe,

Kings oft are forſt in ſeruile yoakes to drawe.

M. Drayton.

### 1.26. Country, common-weale.

We muſt affect our Country as our parents,

And if at any time we alienate

Our loue or induſtry from doing it honor,

It muſt reſpect effects and touch the ſoule,

Matter of conſcience and religion,

And not deſire of rule or benefit.

G. Peele.

Neceſſitie enforceth euery wight,

To loue his natiue ſeat with all his might.

A happie quarrell is it and a good,

For countries cauſe to ſpend our deareſt blood.

G. Gaſcoigne.

That publike weale muſt needs to ruine go,

Where priuate profit is preferred ſo.

G. Geffrayes.

Home though it homely be, yet is ſweet,

And natiue ſoyle is beſt.

S. I. Harr.

[[Page 38]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=26)

If ſo the temperature of Common-weale

Be guided by the courſe of heauenly powers,

Such as in deep affaires will iuſtly deale,

Muſt haue an eye to thoſe eternall bowres,

And by their view direct this ſtate of ours.

Then how can he a perfect ſtates man proue,

That knowes not how celeſtiall bodies moue?

Th. Stouer.

—The loue

That men their country and their birth-right beare,

Exceeds all loue, and dearer is by farre:

Our countries loue, thē friends or children are.

T. Kyd.

### 1.27. Content.

All wealth and wiſedome reſts in true Content.

Contentment is our heauen, and all our deeds

Bound in that circle, ſeld or neuer cloſde.

G. Chapman.

Who ſeekes to haue the thing we call enough,

Acquaint himſelfe with Contentation:

For plenteouſneſſe is but a naked name:

And what ſufficeth vſe of mortall men,

Shall beſt apay the meane and modeſt harts.

G. Gaſcoigne.

The nobleſt mind the beſt contentment hath.

Ed. Spencer.

High climing wits do catch a ſudden fall,

With none of theſe Content doth dwell withall.

D. Lodge.

Content feeds not on glory nor on pelfe.

Cōtent can be contented with her ſelfe.

Th. Baſtard.

[[Page 39]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=26)

Cōtent is worth a monarchy, and miſchief hits the hie.

W. Warner.

Who ſo contented liues, is happie wiſe.

D. Lodge.

Inconſtant change ſuch tickle turnes hath lent,

As who ſo feares to fall, muſt ſeeke Content.

Depriue the world of perfect diſcontent.

All glories end, true honour ſtrait is ſtain'd:

And life it ſelfe in errors courſe is ſpent.

All toyle doth ſort but to a ſory end,

For through miſlikes each learnes for to amend.

D. Lodge.

He only liues moſt happily

That's free and farre from maieſtie:

Can liue content, although vnknowne:

He fearing none, none fearing him:

Medling with nothing but his owne,

While gazing eyes at crownes grow dim.

Th. Kyd.

### 1.28. Courage.

—To Courage great

It is no leſſe beſeeming well to beare,

The ſtorme of fortunes frowne, or heauens threat,

Then in the ſun-ſhine of her countenance cleare,

Timely to ioy and carry comely cheare.

Ed. Spencer.

High Courage with true wiſedome euer backt,

Winnes perfect fame.

Th. Lodge.

[[Page 40]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=27)

Nere was there euer noble courage ſeene,

That in aduantage would his puiſſance boaſt,

Honor is leaſt where ods appeareth moſt.

Ed. Spencer.

Where is no courage, there is no ruth nor mone.

Idem.

Good hart in ill, doth th' euil much amend.

Idem.

Courage imboldneth wit, wit courage armes.

M. Drayton.

They make their fortune who are ſtout and wiſe,

Wit rules the heauens, diſcretion guides the skies.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

Action is fiery valou [...]s ſouerainge good.

G. Chapman.

No foote to foe Repining courage yeelds.

Ed. Spencer.

Then are the valiant who more vaine, then cowardes who more wiſe,

Not men that trauell Pegaſus, but fortunes fooles do riſe?

W Warner.

Be valiant, not too ventrous, but fight to fight againe,

Euen Hercules did hold it ods, for one to ſtriue with twaine.

Idem.

Might wanting meaſure, moueth ſurquedrie.

Ed. Spencer.

—More is he that ventureth for more,

Then who fights but for what he had before.

S. Daniell.

—Valour mixt with feare, boldeneth dread,

May march more circumſpect with better heed.

Idem.

[[Page 41]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=27)

Valour in greateſt daungers ſhewes moſt bright.

As full-fac't Phoebe in the darkeſt night.

Ch. Fitz Geffrey.

The Spartanes once exilde Archilochus,

The Author of Lycambes Tragedie,

Becauſe he ſaid it was commodious,

Rather to caſt away his ſhield and flie,

Then boldly to reſiſt, and brauely die.

Idem.

### 1.29. Court.

The Princes Court is manſion of the wiſe.

Figure of heauen, faire fountaine of delights,

Theater of honours, earthly paradice,

Sudden aduancer, Spheare of pureſt light,

The liuely Vatican of bewties bright.

Thither let Phoebus progenie reſort,

Where ſhines their father, but in Ioues great Court?

Th. Storer.

— This is euer proper vnto Courts,

That nothing can be done but fame reports.

S. Daniell.

To cenſure is the ſubiect of the Court,

From thence fame carries, thither fame doth bring,

There too each word, a thouſand ecchoes ring,

A Lotterie, where moſt looſe, but fewe do winne.

M. Drayton.

Nothing in Court is done without a fee,

The Courtier needs muſt recompenced bee.

E. Sp.

Moſt miſerable man, whom wicked fate

Hath brought to Court to ſue for, had I wiſt,

That fewe hath found, but many one hath miſt.

Idem.

[[Page 42]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=28)

— The Court is counted Venus net,

Where gifts and vows, foreſtalls are often ſet:

None be ſo chaſte as Veſta, but ſhall meere,

A curteous tongue, to charme her eates with ſweete.

R. Greene.

—The Court hath much of vanitie and painfull eaſe.

W. Ʋ Ʋarner.

—The Court is now become a skittiſh colte,

Of wiſe men hardlier man aged then of the glorious dolt,

Idem.

Theſe all deformities in forme in ſome one man we ſee,

More garded then regarded, franke not to continue free,

Whē as the merchāts booke, the map of all his wealth ſhalbe.

Idem.

Sometimes the courts of kings were vertuous ſchooles,

Now finde we nought in Court, but curious fooles.

O you whoſe noble hearts cannot accord,

To be the the ſlaues to an infamous Lord,

And knowes not how to mixe with perillous art,

The deadly poyſon with the amorous dart,

Whoſe natures being found, wills no conſtraint,

Nor will your face with flattering penſill paint.

For weele nor woe, for pitie nor for hire,

Of good my Lords their fauours to require,

Goe not to Court, if ye will me beleeue,

For in that place where ye thinke to releeue:

The honour due fot vertue yee ſhall finde,

Nought but contempt which leaues good men behind.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

The wanton luxurie of Court,

Doth forme the people of like ſort.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 43]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=28)

Ye worthy dames that in your breaſts do beare,

Of your all-ſeeing god, no ſeruile feare:

Ye that of honour haue a greater care,

Then ſights of Courts, I pray you come not there,

Let them that in their purſe haue not a mite,

Cloathe them like Kings, and play the Hypocrite,

And with a lying tale and fained cheare,

Court-coozen them whom they would ſee on beare,

Let there the Pandar ſell his wife for gaine,

With ſeruice vile, his nobleſſe to attaine:

Let him that ſerues the time, chaunge his intent,

With faith vnconſtant ſaile at euery vent.

Th. Hudſrn. Tranſl.

The Court was neuer barren yet of thoſe

Which could with ſubtill traine, and hard aduiſe,

Worke on the Princes weakenes and diſpoſe,

Of feeble frailtie eaſieſt to entice.

S. Daniell.

Golden cuppes do harbor poyſon,

And the greateſt pompe diſſembling,

Court of ſeaſoned words hath foyſon

Treaſon haunts in moſt diſſembling.

D. Lodge.

Ye fearefull wits, ye impes of Achelous,

Which wracks the wiſeſt youth with charming voice,

Ye Circes, who by your enchauntment ſtrange,

In ſtones and ſwine, your Louers true doo change:

Ye Stymphalids, who with your youth vptakes,

Ye Rauens that from vs our riches takes.

Ye who with riches, art, and painted face,

For Priams wife puts Caſtor's ſiſter in place.

[[Page 44]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=29)Ye Myrrhaes,
Canaces, and Semyrames,

And if there were yet moe defamed dames,

Come all to Court, and there ye ſhall receiue

A thouſand gaines, vnmeete for you to haue,

There ſhall you ſee the gifts of great prouinces,

There ſhall you ſee the grace of graceleſſe Princes.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Courtiers as the tide do riſe and fall.

Ed. Spencer.

— It doth not ſit

With Courtiers maieſtie to be reputed

Too learn'd, too graue, too fine, or too conceited.

Thomas Stouer.

Who full of wealth and honours blandiſhment,

Among great Lords his yoonger yeares hath ſpent,

And quaffing deeply of the Court delights,

Vſde nought but tilts, armours, and maskes, and ſights,

If in his age his Princes angry doome,

With deepe diſgrace, daine him to liue at home

In homely cottage, where continually

The bitter ſmoake exhales aboundantly,

From his before vnſorrowe-drained braine,

The brackiſh vapours of a ſiluer raine,

Where vſher leſſe both day and night the North,

South Eaſt, and Weſt windes enter and go forth.

Where round about the lower roofte-broke walles,

In ſtead of Arras, hang with Spider calles:

Where all at once he reacheth as he ſtands,

With brows the roofe, both walls with both his hands.

He weepes and ſighes, and ſhunning comforts aye,

Wiſheth pale death a thouſand times a day,

[[Page 45]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=29)And yet at
length falling to worke, is glad

To bite a browne cruſt that the mouſe hath had,

And in a diſh, in ſtead of Plate or glaſſe,

Sups oaten drinke, in ſtead of Hypocraſſe.

I. Syluister.

### 1.30. Courteſie.

Of Court it ſeemes, men Courteſie do call,

For that it there moſt vſeth to abound,

And well beſeemeth that in Princes hall,

That vertue ſhould be plentifully found.

Which of all goodly manners is the ground,

And roote of ciuill conuerſation.

Ed. Spencer.

Mongſt vertues all growes not a fairer flower,

Then is the bloome of comely Courteſie,

Which though it on a lowely ſtalke do bower,

Yet brauncheth forth in braue nobilitie,

And ſpreads it ſelfe through all ciuilitie:

Of which though preſent age doo plentious ſeeme,

Yet being matcht with plaine antiquitie,

Ye will them all but fained ſhewes eſteeme,

Which carry colours faire, which feeble eies miſdeem.

Idem.

— In the triall of true Courteſie,

Its now ſo farre from that which once it was,

That it indeed is nought but forgerie,

Faſhion'd to pleaſe the eyes of them that paſſe,

Which ſee not perfect things but in a glaſſe,

Yet is that glaſſe ſo gay, it cannot blinde

The wiſeſt ſight, to thinke that gold is braſſe.

[[Page 46]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=30)But vertues
ſeate is deepe within the minde,

And not in outward ſhew, but inward thoughts defind.

Idem.

— This noble vertue and diuine,

Doth chiefly make a man ſo rare and odde,

As in that one, they moſt reſemble God.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

— Courteous ſpeech vſage milde and kinde,

Wipes malice out of euery noble minde.

S. I. Harrington.

— Courteſie ofttimes in ſimple bowers,

Is found as great, as in the ſtately towers.

Idem.

Tis meete a gentle heart ſhould euer ſhowe

By Courteſie, the fruites of true gentilitie,

Which will by practice, to an habit growe,

And make men do the ſame with great facilitie.

Likewiſe, the dunghill-blood a man ſhall know

By churliſh parts, and acts of inciuilitie,

Whoſe nature apt to take each lewde infection,

Cuſtome confirmes, and makes ill in perfection.

Idem.

### 1.31. Crueltie.

All lay on hands to puniſh Crueltie.

M. Drayton.

— Cruell deeds can neuer ſcape the ſcourge

Of open ſhame, or elſe ſome bloody death,

Repentance ſelfe, that other ſinnes may purge,

Doth flie from this, ſo ſore the ſoule it ſleieth,

Diſpaire diſſolues the cruell caitiffes breath,

[[Page 47]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=30)For
vengeance due doth ſuddenly alight

On cruell deeds, the miſchiefe to requite.

I. H. Mir. of M.

### 1.32. Cuſtome.

Round headed Cuſtome th'apoplexie is,

Of bedrid nature, and liues led amis,

And takes away all feeling of offence.

G. Chapman.

Cuſtome abuſd brings vertue in diſdaine.

Nature with Cuſtome ioyned, neuer failes

But by her ſelfe, and her ſelfe preuailes.

D. Lodge.

Whereas to nature, forward to retaine,

Lewde obiects are annext, and Cuſtomes vaine,

The wounds grow deſperate, and death doth  [...]nd,

Before good counſell can the fault amend.

Idem.

Cuſtome the worlds iudgement doth blind ſo farre,

That vertue is oft arraign'd at vices barre.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

### 1.33. Danger.

— Danger cloath'd in ragged weede,

Made of beares skinne, that him more dreadfull, made,

Yet his owne face was dreadfull, ne did neede

Strange horror to deforme his griſly ſhade,

A net in th'one hand, and a ruſtie blade

[...]n th'other was, this miſchiefe, that miſhap

With th'one, his foes he threatned to inuade,

[...]or whom he could not kill, he practis'd to intrap.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 48]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=31)

Danger hath honour, great deſignes their fame.

S. Dan.

The greateſt daungers promiſe greateſt bliſſe.

M. Drayton.

Danger deuiſeth ſhifts, wit waits on feare.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Daunger's the chiefeſt ioy to happineſſe,

And reſolution honours faireſt ayme,

Ch. Marlowe.

The path is ſmooth that leadeth vnto Daunger.

VV. Sh.

When as we thinke we moſt in ſafetie ſtand,

The greateſt daunger then, is neare at hand.

M. Drayton.

The Daunger hid, the place vnknowne and wilde,

Breeds dreadfull doubts: oft fire is without ſmoake,

And perill without ſhewe.

Ed. Spencer.

Ay-me, how many perills do enfolde

The righteous man, to make him daily fall:

Were not that heauēly grace did him behold,

And ſteadfaſt truth acquite him out of all.

Idem.

A thouſand perills lie in cloſe awaite,

About vs daily to worke our decay,

That none except a god, or god his guide,

May them auoyd, or remedie prouide.

Idem.

In perill, we do thinke our ſelues moſt ſure,

And oft in death ſome men are moſt ſecure.

No Danger but in hie eſtate, none enuies mean degre [...]

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

[[Page 49]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=31)

—Daungerous things diſſembled ſildome are,

Which many eyes attend with buſie care.

M. Drayton.

The abſent danger greater ſtill appeares,

Leſſe feares he, who is neare the thing he feares.

Moſt ſtrong is he when daungers are at hand,

That liues prepard' their furies to withſtand.

Of common ſence he is depriued cleane,

That falles with cloſed eyes on daunger ſeene:

And he that may both paine and hurt eſchue,

Is vaine, if he his proper death purſue.

S. Daniell.

### 1.34. Dread.

Next ſawe we Dread, all trembling how he ſhooke,

With foote vncertaine profered here and there:

Benumbd of ſpeech, and with a gaſtly looke,

Searcht euery place, all pale and dead for feare:

His cap borne vp with ſtaring of his haire.

Stoynd and amaz'd at his owne ſhade for dread,

And feeling greater daungers then was need.

M. Sackuill.

—Coward Dread lackes order, feare wants art,

Deafe to attend, commaunded, or defirde.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

### 1.35. Death.

—A dumbe dead courſe we  [...]awe,

Heauy and cold the ſhape of death aright,

That daunts all earthly creatures to his lawes

Againſt whoſe force in vaine it i [...] to fight,

[[Page 50]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=32)Ne Peeres,
ne Princes, nor no mortall wight,

No Townes, ne Realmes, Cities ne ſtrongeſt Tower,

But all perforce muſt yeeld vnto his power.

His dart anon out of his corpes he tooke,

And in his hand (a needfull fight to ſee)

With great tryumph eftſoones the ſame he ſhooke:

That moſt of all my feares affraied me,

His body dight with nought but bones perdie.

The naked ſhape of man there ſawe I plaine,

All ſaue the fleſh, the ſinew, and the vaine.

M. Sackuill.

Death is a port, whereby we paſſe to ioy,

Life is a lake, that drowneth all in paine:

Death is ſo neare it ceaſeth all annoy.

Life is ſo leaud, that all it yeelds is vaine.

And as by life to bondage man was brought,

Euen ſo likewiſe by death was freedome wrought.

E. of Surrey.

Nought is immortall vnderneath the Sun,

All things are ſubiect to deaths tyrannie:

Both clownes & kings, one ſelfeſame courſe muſt run,

And whatſoeuer liues is ſure to die.

Th. Kyd.

Death's alwaies readie, and our time is knowne

To be at heauens diſpoſe, and not our owne.

Idem.

The braueſt are as bloſſomes, and the longeſt liuer dies:

And dead, the louelieſt creature as the lothſoms carion lies.

W. Warner.

Our frailties done are written in the flowers,

Which flouriſh now, and fade away ere many howres.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 51]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=32)

—All earthly things be borne

To die the death, for nought long time may laſt:

The ſunne his beautie yeelds to winters blaſt.

I. H. M. of Magiſt.

Is't not gods deed what euer thing is done,

In heauen and earth? Did not he all create

To die againe? all ends that was begunne:

Their times, in his eternall bookes of fate,

Are written ſure, and haue their certaine date.

Who then can ſtriue with ſtrong neceſſitie,

That holds the world in his ſtill chaunging ſtate?

Or ſhun the death ordaind by deſteny,

When houre of death is come, let none aske whence or why.

Ed. Spencer.

—Death amongſt all deales equally,

For hee's impartiall, and with one ſelfe hand

Cuts off both good and bad, none can withſtand.

Ch. Middleton.

Death certaine is to all the prouerbe ſaith:

Vncertaine is to all the houre of death.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Pale fearefull death with bloudy dart doth ſtrike,

The wretched caitiffe and the king alike.

Vntimely neuer comes the lifes laſt meere,

In cradle death may rightly claime his debt,

Straight after birth, is due the fatall beere:

By deaths permiſſion th'aged linger heere.

Euen in the ſwath-bands our commiſsion goeth,

To looſe thy breath, that yet but yoongly bleweth.

I. H. Mir. of M.

All muſicke ſleepes where death doth lead the daunce.

Ed. Spencer.

Let nature for perfection mould a paragon each way,

Yet death at laſt on fineſt lumps of liuing fleſh wil pray

For nature neuer framed it, that neuer ſhall decay.

VV. VVarner.

—Fatall death the emperor of graues.

I. Markham.

Death is the key which vnlockes miſerie,

And lets them out to bleſſed libertie.

M. Drayton.

All is but loſt that liuing we beſtowed,

If not well ended at our dying day.

O man haue mind of that laſt bitter rage,

For as the tree doth fall, ſo lies it euer lowe:

Ed. Spencer.

No feare of death ſhould force vs to do ill.

Th. Kyd.

—When for feare of an enſuing ill

We ſeeke to ſhorten our appointed race,

Then tis for feare that we our ſelues do kill:

So fond we are to feare the worlds diſgrace.

Idem.

Happie, thrice happie, who ſo loſt his breath,

That life he gaineth, by his godly death.

Vnwiſe and wretched men to weet whats good or ill,

We deeme of death as doome of ill deſert:

But know we fooles what it vs brings vntill:

Die would we daily once it too expert.

No danger there the ſhepheard can a ſtart,

Faire fields and pleaſant fields there beene,

[[Page 53]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=33)The fields
aye freſh, the graſſe aye greene.

Ed. Spencer.

—This ſame

Which we call death, the ſoules releaſe from woe,

The worke which bring our bliſſe to happie frame:

Sildome arreſts the bodie, but we finde

Some notice of it written in our minde.

I. Markham.

The worth of all men by their end eſteeme,

And then due praiſe, or due reproach them yeeld.

S. Spencer.

—Death is an euill doome.

To good and bad, the common Inne of reſt,

But after death the triall is to come

When beſt ſhall be to them that liued beſt,

But both alike when death hath both ſuppreſt.

Religious reuerence doth buriall teene,

Which who ſo wants, wants ſo much of his reſt.

For all ſo great ſhame after death I weene,

As ſelfe to dien bad, vnburied, bad to beene.

Ed. Spencer.

—Beaſts with careleſſe ſteppes to laethe go,

Where men whoſe thoughts and honours clime on hie,

Liuing with fame, muſt learne with fame to die.

D. Lodge.

Death but an acted paſſion doth appeare,

Where truth giues courage and the conſcience cleare.

M. Drayton.

Who dies, the vtmoſt dolour muſt abide:

But who that liues, is left to waile his loſſe,

So life is loſſe, and death felicitie.

[[Page 54]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=34)Sad life
worſe then glad death, and greater croſſe

To ſee friends graue, then dead, the graue ſelfe to en­groſſe.

Ed. Spencer.

—In wretches ſudden death at once

There long-ſome ill is buried with their bones.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Death is to him that wretched life doth lead

Both grace and gaine; but he in hell doth lie

That liues a loathed life, and wiſhing cannot die.

Ed. Spencer.

Death is moſt louely ſweet and amiable:

But captiu'd life for fouleneſſe admirable.

I. Marſton.

—The toongs of dying men

Inforce attention like deep harmony,

Where words are ſcarce, they are ſildom ſpent in vaine:

For they breath truth, that breath their words in paine.

He that no more muſt ſay, is liſſened more,

Then they whom youth & eaſe haue taught to gloſe:

More are mens ends markt, then their liues before.

The ſetting ſunne and muſick at the cloſe,

As the laſt taſt of ſweet is ſweeteſt taſt,

Writ in remembrance more, then things long paſt.

W. Shakeſpeare.

### 1.36. Delaie.

On the one ſide doubt, on the other ſate Delaie,

Behind the gate, that none her might eſpie;

Whoſe manner was, all paſſengers to ſtaie,

And entertaine with her occaſions ſlie.

Through which, ſome loſt great hope vnheedilie,

Which neuer they recouer might againe:

[[Page 55]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=34)And others
quite excluded forth did lie.

Long languiſhing there, in vnpittied paine,

And ſeeking often entrance afterward in vaine.

Ed. Spencer.

—Daunger growes by lingring till the laſt,

And phiſicke hath no helpe when life is paſt.

Th. Watſon.

—Oft things done, perhaps, do leſſe annoy

Then may the doing, handeled with delay.

S. Daniell.

Delaie in cloſe awaite

Caught hold on me, and thought my ſteps to ſtay,

Faining ſtil, many a fond excuſe, to prate:

And time, to ſteale the treaſure of mans day,

Whoſe ſmalleſt minute loſt, no riches render may.

Ed. Spencer.

—Times delay new hope of helpe ſtill breeds.

Idem.

—Fearfull tormenting

Is leaden ſeruitor, to dull delay.

W. Shakeſpeare.

He that will ſtop the brooke muſt then begin

When ſommers heat hath dried vp the ſpring:

And when his pittering ſtreames are low and thin▪

For let the winter aid vnto them bring,

He growes to be of watry flouds the king:

And though you damme him vp with loftie rankes,

Yet will he quickly ouerflow his bankes.

R. Greene.

Ill newes deferring, is a plague as great as an ill newes.

Ab. Fraunce.

[[Page 56]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=35)

Delay in loue breeds doubts, but ſharpe deniall death·

W. Shakeſpeare.

— Intermiſſion ſuffers men diſpute,

What dangers are, and caſt with further care,

Colde doubt cauells with honour, ſcorneth fame,

And in the end feare waighes downe faith with ſhame▪

S. Daniel.

Where hearts be knit, what helpes if not in ioy?

Delay breeds doubts, no cunning to be ioy.

M. D.

### 1.37. Delight.

In things without vs, no Delight is ſure·

G. Chapman.

A ſweete in ſhape is but a bad Delight.

D. Lodge.

Proſperitie a flatterer is found,

Delight is feareleſſe till it feele the wound.

M. D.

Ʋid. Pleaſure.

### 1.38. Deſire.

— Deſire, whom not the firmament,

Nor aire, nor earth, nor Ocean can content,

Whoſe lookes are hookes, whoſe bellies bottomleſſe,

Whoſe hands are gripes to ſcrape with greedines,

Vnder whoſe command,

She brings to field a rough vnruly band,

Firſt, ſecret burning, mightie ſwoln ambition,

Whom Epicurus many worlds ſuffice not,

Whoſe furious thirſt of proud aſpiring dies not,

Whoſe hands tranſported with phantaſticke paſſion,

Beare painted ſteeples in imaginaton.

I. Syluiſter. Tranſl.

[[Page 57]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=35)

Amongſt the moſt, the worſt, we beſt can chuſe,

Tis eaſie to deſire, but hard to vſe.

M. Drayton.

Deſire hath philters, which deſire procure.

Idem.

If blinde deſire thy heart hath once embraced,

Inthrall'd it is, and honour ſo defaced.

.˙.˙

Deſire with ſmall encouraging growes bolde.

M. Drayton.

What can be ſaid that Louers cannot ſay?

Deſire can make a Doctor in a day.

Idem.

Things much retain'd, do make vs much deſire them,

And bewties ſeldome ſeene, makes vs admire them.

Idem.

### 1.39. Destinie.

Sad Clotho held the rocke, the whiles the thrid

By griſly Lacheſis, was ſpunne with paine,

That cruell Atropos eft-ſoones vndid,

With curſed knife cutting the twiſt in twaine,

Moſt wretched mē, whoſe daies depēdonthrids ſo vain.

E. of S.

The holy Prophet brought Aſtolpho, where

A Pallace (ſeldome ſeene by mortall men)

Was plac't, by which, a thicke darke riuer ran,

Each roome therein was full of diuers fleeces:

Of Wolle, of Lint of Woll, or elſe of Cotten,

An aged woman ſpunne the diuers peeces.

Whoſe looke and hue did ſhew her old and rotten,

Nor much vnlike vnto that labour this is.

[[Page 58]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=36)By which in
ſommer a new made ſilke is gotten,

Where from the ſilke-wormes his fine garment taking,

They reaue him of the cloathes of his owne making.

For firſt in one large roome a woman ſpan,

Infinite thrids of diuers ſtuffe and hew,

An other doth wi [...]h all the ſpeed ſhe can,

With other ſtuffe the diſtaffe ſtill renew:

The thrid in feature like, and pale and wan,

Seuers the faire f [...]om foule, the olde from new.

Who be theſe here, the Duke demaunds his guide?

Theſe be the fatall ſiſters he replide:

The Parcaes that the thrid of life do ſpin

To mortall men, hence death and nature, knowe

When life muſt end, and when it muſt begin.

Now ſhe that doth deuide them, and beſtow

The courſe from finer, and the thick from thin

Workes to that kinde, that thoſe which fineſt grow,

For ornaments in Paradice muſt dwell.

The courſe are curſt, to be conſum'd in hell.

Further, the Duke did in the place behold,

That when the thrids were ſpent that had bene ſpunne

Theit names in braſſe, in ſiluer, and in gold

Were wrote, and ſo into great heapes were donne.

From which, a man that ſeemed wondrous old

With whole loades of thoſe names away did runne,

And turn'd againe as faſt, the way he went,

Nor neuer weary was, nor neuer ſpent.

This aged man did hold his pace ſo ſwift,

As though to runne, he had bene onely borne,

And in the lappet of his cloake were borne

The names, &c. This was time.

[[Page 59]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=36)An heape of
names within his cloake he bore,

And in the riuer did them all vnlade:

Or to ſay truth, away he caſt them all,

Into this ſtreame, which Laethe we do call.

Vide. Fame.

—You ſad daughters of the quiet night,

Ed. Spencer.

What man can turne the ſtreame of Deſtenie?

Or breake the chaine of ſtrong neceſſitie?

Which faſt is tide to Iones eternall ſeate?

Idem.

—What ſhalbe ſhall. There is no choice,

Things needs muſt driue as Deſtenie decreeth:

For which we ought in all our haps reioyce,

Becauſe the eye eternall, things foreſeeth:

Which to no ill at any time agreeth,

For ills, too ill to vs, be good to it,

So farre his skill exceeds, our reache of wit.

I. H. Mir. of M.

Woe worth the wight that ſtriues with Gods foreſight

They are not wiſe, but wickedly do erre,

But neuer caſtle kept out deſtinie.

M. Drayton.

—Who can deceiue his deſtinie?

Or weene by warning to auoyd his fate?

That when he ſleepes in moſt ſecuritie,

And ſafeſt ſeemes, him ſooneſt doth amate,

And findeth due effect, or ſoone, or late,

So feeble is the power of fleſhly arme.

Ed. Spencer.

Men may lament, but neuer diſanull.

Ch. Fitz.

### 1.40. Diſpaire.

Ere long they came where that ſame wicked wight

His dwelling has, lowe in a hollowe Caue,

Farre vnderneathe a craggy clift vpright,

Darke, dolefull, drery, like a drery graue,

That ſtill for carion carkaſſes doth craue.

On top whereof, aye dwells the ghaſtly Owle,

Shriking his balefull note, which euer draue

Farre from that haunt, all other chearefull fowle.

And all about it wandring ghoſtes do waile and houle▪

And all about olde ſtockes and ſtubs of trees,

Whereas, nor fruite, nor leafe was euer ſeene,

Did hang vpon the ragged rocky trees,

[[Page 61]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=37)On which had
many witches hanged beene,

Whoſe carkaſſes were ſcattered on the greene,

And throwne about the cliffes.

Ed. Spencer.

That darkeſome caue they enter, where they finde

That curſed man, lowe ſitting on the ground,

Muſing full ſadly in his ſullen minde:

Hi [...] griſly locks, long growne and vnbound,

Diſordered hung about his ſhoulders round

And hid his face; through which his hollowe eies

Lookt deadly, dull, and ſtared as aſtound.

His rawebone cheekes through penurie and pine,

Were ſhrunke into his iawes, as he did neuer dine,

His garment nought but many ragged clouts,

With thornes together pind and patched was,

The which his naked ſides he wraps abouts.

And him beſide, there lay vpon the graſſe,

Adrery coarſe, whoſe life away did paſſe,

All wallowed in his owne, yet luke-warme blood,

That from his wound yet welled freſh a laſſe.

In which a ruſtie knife faſt fixed ſtood,

And made an open paſſage for the guſhing flood.

Idem.

Me thought by night, a griſly ghoſt in darke I ſawe,

Eke euer ſtill to me with ſtealing ſteps ſhe drew,

[...]he was of colour pale, and deadly hew,

Her clothes reſembled thouſand kinds of thrall,

And pictures plaine of haſtned deaths withall.

D. Lodge.

— As it is not lawfull for a man

At ſuch a Kings departure or deceaſe,

To leaue the place, and falſifie his faith,

So in this place we ought not to ſurrender

That deerer part, till heauen it ſelfe commaund it.

For as they lent vs life to do vs pleaſure,

So looke they for returne of ſuch a treaſure.

O ruthleſſe murderer of immortall ſoules,

A laſſe, to pull vs from the happie poales,

And plunge vs headlong in the yawning hell,

Thy ceaſeleſſe fraudes and fetches who can tell?

Thou play'ſt the Lyon when thou dooſt ingage,

Blood-thirſtie Neroes barbarous heart with rage,

While fleſht in murders, butcherlike he paints

The Saint-poore world, with the dear blood of Saints▪

Thou plaieſt the dog, when by the mouth prophane,

Of ſome falſe Prophets thou doeſt belch thy bane.

Where from the Pulpet barkingly he rings,

Bold blaſphemies againſt the King of Kings.

Thou plai'ſt the ſwine when plung'd in pleaſures vile,

Some Epicure doth ſober mindes defile,

Tranſforming lewdly by his looſe impietie,

Sweete Lacedemon to a ſoft ſocietie.

Thou plaieſt the Nightingale, or elſe the ſwan,

When any famous Rhetorician

With captious wit, and curious language drawes,

Seduced hearers, and ſubuerts the lawes.

Thou play'ſt the foxe when thou doeſt faine aright.

The face and phraſe of ſome deepe Hypocrite.

True painted tombe, dead ſeeming cole, but quicke,

A ſcorpion fell, whoſe hidden taile doth pricke:

Yet this were little, if thy ſpight audacious,

Spar'd (at the leaſt) the face of angels gracious,

And if thou didſt not apely immitate

Th'almighties workes, the warieſt wits to mate.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

As a falſe Louer that thicke ſnares hath laide,

To entrap th'honour of a faire yoong maide,

When ſhe (though liſtening) litle eare affords,

To his ſweete courting deepe affected words,

Feares ſome aſſwaging of his freezing flame,

And ſoothes himſelfe with hope to gaine his game,

And wrapt with ioy vpon this point perſiſts,

That parlying cittie neuer long reſiſts.

Euen ſo the ſerpent that doth counterfet

A guilefull call to allure vs to his net:

Perceiuing Eue his flattering gloze diſgeſt,

He proſecutes, and iocund doth not reſt,

Till he haue tried foote, hand, head and all,

Vpon the breach of this new battered wall.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

### 1.42. Diſcord.

Hard by the gates of hell her dwelling is,

There where as all the plagues and harmes abound▪

Which puniſh wicked men that walke amis.

It is a darkeſome delue, far vnder ground,

And thornes which barren brookes inuirond roun [...]

That none the ſame may eaſily out win,

Yet many waies to enter may be found,

But none to iſſue forth when one is in,

Ed. Spencer.

Ate, mother of debate

And all diſſention which doth daily grow

Idem.

—He knew her weed of ſundry hew,

Patched with infinit vnequall liſts,

Her skin in ſundry naked places view,

At diuers rents and cuts he may that liſts:

Her haire was gray, and red, and black and blew,

And hard and ſoft, in laces ſome ſhe twiſts:

Some hangeth downe, vpright ſome ſtandeth ſtaring,

As if each haire with other had bene ſquaring.

Her lap was full of writs and of citations,

Of proceſſes, of actions, and arreſts,

Of bills, of anſweres, and of replications,

Greeuing the ſimple ſort with great vexations.

She had reſorting to her as her gueſts

Attending on her circuits and her iournies,

Suters and Clarkes, Lawiers, and Atturnies.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Her face moſt foule and filthy was to ſee,

With ſquinted eyes contrariwiſe intended:

And loathly mouth'd, vnmeet a mouth to bee.

That nought but gall and venome comprehended,

Her lying tongue was in two parts diuided,

M. of Magiſt.

Concord in kingdomes is great aſſurance,

And royall fame lies do neuer fall:

But where diſcord doth lead the doubtfull dance,

With buſie brawles, and termes of variance,

Where malice minſtrell is, the pipe ill report,

The mask miſchiefe, and ſo doth end the ſport.,

Idem.

Fire-brand of hell firſt tinde in Phlegeton,

By thouſand ſuries, and from thence outthrowne

Into this world, to worke confuſion,

And ſet it all on fire by force vnknowne,

Is wicked diſcord; whoſe ſmall ſparkes once blowne,

None but a God or godlike man can ſlake:

Such as was Orpheus, that when ſtrife was growne

Amongſt thoſe famous Imps of Greece, did take

His ſiluer harp in hand, & ſhortly friends them mak [...]

Ed. Spencer.

O cruell diſcord, food of deadly hate,

O mortall corſiue to a common-weale:

—Fierce lightening from her eies

Did ſet on fier faire Heroes ſacrifice:

And the bright flame became a maid moſt faire

For her aſpect; her treſſes were of wire,

Knit like a net, where harts all ſet on fire,

Struggled in pants and could not get releaſt:

Her armes were all with golden pincers dreſt,

And twentie faſhioned knots, pullies and brakes,

And all her body girdled with printed ſnakes.

Her downe parts in a ſcorpion taile combinde,

Freckled with twenty colours p [...]edwings ſhinde

Out of her ſhoulders; cloth did neuer die,

Nor ſweeter colours euer viewed eie.

In ſcorching Turkey, Cares, Tartarie:

Then ſhinde about this ſpirit notorious,

Nor was Arachnes web ſo glorious.

Of lightning and of ſhreds ſhe was begot,

More hold in baſe diſſemblers is there not.

Thus whileſt he laid his head vpon her lap,

She in a fiery mantle doth him wrap:

And carries him vp from his lumpiſh mould,

Into the skies whereas he might behold

Th'earth in perfect roundneſſe of a ball,

Exceeding globes moſt artificiall.

Which in a fixed point nature diſpoſed,

Next vnto him, malicious Enuie rode,

Vpon a rauenous Wolfe, and ſtill did chawe

Betweene his cankred teeth a venomous tode,

That all the poyſon ranne about his iawe.

But inwardly he chawed his owne mawe

[[Page 71]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=42)At
neighbours wealth, that made him euer ſad,

For death it was when any good he ſawe,

And wept, that cauſe of weeping none he had,

But when he heard of harme, he waxed wondrous glad.

Ed. Spencer.

The other held a ſnake with venome fraught,

On which ſhe fed and gnawed hungerly:

As if that long ſhe had not eaten ought,

That round about the iawes we might diſcry

The bloody gore, and poyſon dropping loathſomly.

Her name was Enuie, knowne well thereby,

Whoſe nature is to greeue and grudge at all

That ſhe ſees done praiſe worthily:

Whoſe ſight to her is greateſt croſſe may fall,

And vexeth ſo, that makes her eate her gall:

For when ſhe wanteth other thing to eate,

She feedes on her owne ma [...] vnnaturall.

And of her owne foule entrailes make her meate,

Meate fit for ſuch a monſters monſtrous diet.

Idem.

I chaunced on a monſter of a man,

With health heart ſicke, ſterued with ſtore of foode,

With riches poore, with beautie pale and wan,

Wretched with happineſſe, euil with good.

One eye did enuie at the th'other eie:

Becauſe the other enuide more then hee,

His hands did fight for the firſt iniurie,

So Enuie enuide, enuide to be.

And as he went, his tender foote was ſore,

And enuide at the foote that went before.

Th. Baſtard.

[[Page 72]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=43)

This monſter honors hurt, is like the curre

That barkes at ſtrangers comming at the durre.

But ſparing alwaies thoſe are to her knowne,

To them moſt gentle, to the others throwne.

This monſter als is like a rauing cloude,

Which threatens alwaies kindly Ʋulcan loude

To ſmore and drowne him with her powring raine,

Yet force of fire repels his force againe.

K. of S.

Oft malice makes the mind to ſhed the boyled brine,

And enuies humor oft vnlades, by conduits of the eine.

Euen ſo a mind in enuy cold,

Alwaies within it ſelfe doth burne.

Idem.

Each ſence may common ſubiects comprehend,

Things excellent the ſenſitiue confound:

The eye with light and colours may contend:

The care endure the note of common ſound

Both faile, when glorious beames and ſtrokes abound▪

So Enuy that at meaneſt things beares ſpight,

Stands mute at view of vnexſpected height.

Ed. Spencer.

Foule enuie, thou the partiall iudge of right,

Sonne of deceit, borne of that harlot hate:

Nurſed in hell, a vile and vgly ſprite,

Feeding on ſlaunder, cheriſht with debate,

Neuer contented with thine owne eſtate:

Deeming alike, the wicked and the good,

Whoſe words be gall, whoſe actions end in blood.

M. Drayton.

Enuie doth ceaſe, wanting to feede vpon.

Idem.

Like as the poyze that would the palme repreſſe

The deeper doth the ſame roote ſpread abroad.

M. of M.

Sicilian Tyrants yet did neuer finde

Then Enuie, greater torment of the minde.

Idem.

Our dayes are ſtampt in Enuies mint,

And this our age caſt in the Iron mold,

Our hearts are hew'd out of Cancaſean flint,

And two leau'd plates of braſſe our breſt enfold,

Hate waxeth yoong, the world thus waxing old,

And beſt we like them, that do vs loue the leaſt,

And leaſt we loue them, whom we ſhould like beſt.

Ch. Fitz Geffrey.

### 1.46. Error.

— His gliſte [...]ing armour made

[[Page 74]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=44)A little
glooming light, much like a ſhade:

By which ſhe ſaw the vgly monſter plaine,

Halfe like a ſerpent, horribly diſplaied,

But th'other halfe did womans ſhape retaine,

Moſt loathſome, filthy, foule, and full of vile diſdaine.

And as ſhe lay vpon the dyrtie ground,

Her huge long taile, her den all ouerſpred,

Yet was in knots, and many bouts vpwound:

Pointed with mortall ſting: of her there bred

A thouſand yoong ones, which ſhe daily fed,

Sucking vpon her poyſoned dugges, each one

Of ſundrie ſhapes, yet all ill ſauoured.

Soone as the vncouth light vpon them ſhone,

Into her mouth they crept, and ſuddenly were gone.

Ed. Spencer.

To erre is proper vnto men, and but brutiſh to perſiſt▪

W. Warner.

— Errors are no errors, but by fate,

For oft the euent makes foule faults fortunate.

S. Daniell.

— Errors left vnpuniſht, are profeſt,

And being not defended, are oppreſt.

Ch. Middleton.

To heare good counſell, error neuer loues.

D. Lodge.

— Errors are hardly moued,

That loue doth breed in an vnaduiſed breſt.

S. I. H. Tranſl.

A ſtony coldneſſe hath benumbde the ſence,

And liuely ſpirits of each liuing wight,

And dim'd with darkneſſe their intelligence,

Darkenes more then Cymerians day by night,

[[Page 75]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=44)And monſters
Error flying in the aire,

Hath mar'd the face of all that ſeemeth faire.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.47. Faith.

— Fidelia

Like ſunny beames threw forth her chriſtall face,

That could haue mazde the r [...]r'ſt beholders ſight,

And roūd about her head did ſhine like heauens light

She was araied all in Lilly white,

And in her right hand bare a Cup of Gold,

With wine and water filld vp to the height.

In which a ſerpent did himſelfe infold,

That horror made to all that did behold,

But ſhe nowhit did change her conſtant minde.

And in her other hand, ſhe full did hold,

A booke that was both ſignd and ſeald with bloud.

Ed. Spencer.

Faith ſits triumphant on a coach of gold,

Of Tuballs worke, where coſtly Saphires ſhine,

Rich Diamonds, and many Rubies fine,

And if ought elſe, the worke more coſtly hold,

This glorious chariots rowling wheeles are like

The holy wheeles the great Ezechiel ſawe,

For owne ſelfe ſpirit, ſelfe winde and will doth drawe,

Their reſteſſe courſes equall both alike,

The bird that led the Romaine ſtanderds out

The bird that fixed can oppoſe his eies,

Againſt the greateſt light in all the skies,

High through the ayre drawes this rich Coach about.

Faith flaunts it not in ſiluer nor in gold.

Nor precious ſcarlet of the Tyrian die:

[[Page 76]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=45)Nor paints
her face to hide deformitie,

But as ſhe is, ſhe doth her ſelfe vnfolde,

Her body that all bodies doth diſgrace,

Like Iunoes bird is full of watching eies,

Whoſe holy glaunces pierce the loftie skies,

Pierce the hie heauens, and ſee God face to face.

She hath great ſtore of flowing tongues to praiſe

The Lord of hoaſtes: ſhe hath moſt mightie wings,

(Paſſing the ſwiftnes of all mortall things)

That in a moment vp to heauen her raiſe,

Her glorious head is compaſt with a crowne

Nor made of Oliue, pine, or Lawrell bowe,

Nor Parſly wreath which Graecians did allowe.

Th' olympian gaimes for ſignalls of renowne,

But of freſh Roſes pluckt from honours tree,

That neuer ſhrinke for winters chilling froſt,

Nor wither not when Titan hotely toſtes,

But by the Lord for euer watered bee.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

Faith friendly porter of heauens Chriſtall hold,

Conduct vs ſtraight before the throne of gold:

O [...] Gods great grace, there proſtrate on her knee,

Doth praier ſpeake in name of all the three.

I. S. Tranſl.

What was the world before the world? or God ere he was God

Why this he did, or doth not that, this biddē or forbod:

I dare not thinke, or arrogate ſuch miſteries diuine,

Faith with her wits ſignificant ſuffice theſe wits of mine:

To loue God and our neighbours as our ſelfe is all in fine.

W. Warner.

[[Page 77]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=45)

Drawe thy forces all vnto thy hart,

The ſtrongeſt fortreſſe of this earthly part:

And on theſe three, let thy aſſurance lie,

On faith, hope, and humilitie.

M. Drayton.

Faith is thy Fort, thy ſhield, thy ſtronger aide,

Neuer controll'd, nere yeelded, ne diſmaide:

Which doth dilate, vnfold, foretell, expreſſeth,

Which giues rewards, inueſteth and poſſeſſeth.

Idem.

Faith hath not onely power on things terrene

Both hie, and lowe, but oftentimes doth force

Gods iuſtice too, and ſometimes ſeemes perforce,

Gods purpoſes to change and alter cleane.

I. Syl.

— The hardeſt things faith makes moſt poſſible.

Idem.

— Euen the faithfull flocks are like the ground,

That for good fruite, with weedes will ſtill abound:

If that the ſhare and coulter idle lie,

That riues the ſhare, and rootes the brambles bie.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Adde faith vnto your force, and be not faint.

Ed. Spencer.

Onely faith doth iustifie ſay we, of Gods free grace,

By Chriſt, nor faith is idle, but doth charitie embrace.

W. Warner.

### 1.48. Fame.

A monſter ſwifter none is vnder ſunne.

Encreaſing as in waters we diſcrie,

[[Page 78]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=46)The circles
ſmall of nothing that begin,

Which at the length, vnto ſuch breadth do come,

That of a drop which from the skies do fall,

The circles ſpread, and hide the waters all.

So Fame in flight encreaſing more and more,

For at the firſt, ſhe is not ſcarcely knowne,

But by and by ſhe flits from ſhore to ſhore,

To clouds from th' earth, her ſtature ſtraight is growne

There whatſoeuer by her trumpe is blowne,

The ſound that both by ſea and land out-flies,

Rebounds againe, and verberates the skies:

They ſay, the earth that firſt the Giants bred,

For anger that the Gods did them diſpatch,

Brought forth this ſiſter of thoſe monſters dead,

Full light of foote, ſwift wings, the winds to catch,

Such monſter erſt did nature neuer hatch.

As many plumes ſhe hath as top to toe,

So many eyes them vnderneath or moe:

And tongues do ſpeake: ſo many eares do harke,

By night tweene heauen ſhe flies and earthly ſhade,

And ſhreaking takes no quiet ſleepe by darke,

On houſes roofes, or towers as keeper made,

She fits by day, and cities threates to inuade,

And as ſhe tells what things ſhe ſees by view,

She rather ſhewes that's fained falſe, then true,

I. H. Mir. of M.

Fame in a ſtoale of purple ſet with eies,

And eares, and tongues, caried a golden booke,

Vpon the couer, this I ſawe engrau'd.

Pauci quos aequus amauit

Iupiter, aut ardeus euerit ad aethera virtus

Dijs geniti.

G. Peele.

[[Page 79]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=46)

Fame with golden wings aloft doth flie,

Aboue the reach of ruinous decay,

And with braue plumes doth beate the ayrie skie,

Admir'd of baſe borne men, from far away.

Ed. Spencer.

The Brazen Trompe of Iron winged fame,

That mingleth truth with forged lies.

E. Fairfax. Tranſl.

Then came they to the foule and loathſome lake,

Darke, deepe, and mirie, of a dreadfull hue,

Where was the aged man that neuer ſtinted

To carrie bundles of the names imprinted.

This was the man, whom (as I told before)

Nature and cuſtome ſo ſwift of foote had made,

He neuer reſted, but ran euermore.

And with his comming he did vſe this trade:

A heape of names within his cloake he bare,

And in the Riuer did them all vnlade:

Or to (ſay truth) away he caſt them all,

Into this ſtreame which Laethe we do call.

This prodigall old wrerch no ſooner came

Vnto this curſed riuers barren banke,

But deſperately without all feare of blame,

Or caring to deſerue reward or thanke,

He hurl'd therein full many a precious name,

Where millions ſoone into the bottome ſanke:

Hardly in euery thouſand one was found,

That was not in the gulfe quite loſt and dround:

Yet all about great ſtore of birds there flew,

As vultures, carren crowes, and chattering pies,

And many moe of ſundrie kinds and hew,

[[Page 80]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=47)Making
leaude harmonie with their loude cries,

Theſe when the careleſſe wretch the treaſure threw

Into the ſtreame, did all they could deuiſe,

What with their tallents ſome, and ſome with beake

To ſaue theſe names, but find themſelues too weake.

For euer as they thought themſelues to raiſe,

To beare away thoſe names of good renowne,

The waight of them, ſo heauie downeward waies,

They in the ſtreame were driuen to caſt them downe,

Onely two ſwans ſuſtain'd ſo great a paize

In ſpight of him that ſought them all to drowne,

Theſe two did ſtill take vp whoſe names they liſt,

And bare them ſafe away, and neuer miſt.

Sometime all vnder the foule lake they diued,

And tooke vp ſome that were with water couered:

And thoſe that ſeem'd condemned, they repriued.

And often as about the banke they houered,

They caught them, ere they to the ſtreame arriued,

Then went they with the names they had recouered,

Vp to a hill that ſtood the water nie,

On which a ſtately Church was built on hie.

This place is ſacred to immortall fame,

And euermore a Nimph ſtands at the gate,

And tooke the names wherewith the two ſwans came,

Whether they early come, or whether late.

Then all about the Church ſhe hang'd the ſame,

Before that ſacred Image in ſuch rate,

As they might then well be aſſur'd for euer,

Spight of that wretch, in ſafetie to perſeuer.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

[[Page 81]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=47)

Fame on his right hand in a roabe of gold,

Whoſe ſtately traine, Time as her page did beare:

On which for rich imbroydery was enrold,

The deeds of all the Worthies euer were:

So ſtrongly wrought as wrong could not impaire,

Whoſe large memorialls ſhe did ſtill reherſe,

In Poets man immortallizing verſe.

Two tablets on her goodly breſt ſhe bore,

The one of Chriſtall, the other Ebonie,

Engrau'd with names of all that liu'd before

That; the faire booke of heauenly memorie:

Th'other, the baſe ſcrowle of Infamie.

One ſtuft with Poets, Saints, and Conquerors,

Th'other, with Atheiſts, Tyrants, Vſurers,

And in her word appeared as a wonder,

Her daring force, and neuer failing might:

Which ſoftly ſpake farre off, as't were a thunder,

And round about the world would take their flight,

And bring the moſt obſcured things to light.

That ſtill the farther off, the greater ſtill,

Did euer ſound our good, or make our ill.

M. Drayton.

Her dwelling is betwixt the earth and skies,

Her Turret vnto heauen her top vpreares:

The windowes made of Lynceus piercing eies,

And all the walles be made of daintieſt eares,

Where euery thing that's done in earth appeares.

No word is whiſpered in this vaultie round,

But in her pallace ſtraitwaies it doth ſound:

The rafters, trumpets which do rend the aire,

[[Page 82]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=48)Sounding
aloud each name that thither comes.

The chinkes like tongues of all things talking heere,

And all things paſt, in memorie do beare.

The doores vnlocke with euery word man ſaith,

And opens wide with euery little breath.

It's hung about with armes and conquering ſpoiles,

The pillers which ſupport the roofe of this,

Are trophies grauen with Herculean toiles.

The roofe of garlands, crowne, and enſignes is:

In midſt of which a Chriſtall Pyramis,

All ouer caru'd with men of moſt renowne,

Whoſe baſe is her faire chaire, the ſpire her crowne.

Idem.

—Fame

Refuge of hope, the harbinger of truth,

Hand-mayd of heauen vertues skilfull guide,

The life of life, the ages ſpringing youth:

Tryumph of ioy, eternities faire bride,

The virgins glory, and the martyrs pride.

The courages immortall raiſing fire,

The very height to which great thoughts aſpire:

The ſtaire by which men to the ſtarres do clime:

The minds firſt mouer greatnes to expreſſe,

Faiths armour, and the vanquiſher of time.

A pleaſant ſweet againſt deaths bitterneſſe,

The hie reward which doth all labours bleſſe:

The ſtudie which doth heauenly things impart,

The ioy amidſt the tedious waies of art.

Learnings greene lawrell, Iuſtice glorious throne,

The Muſes chariot, memories true food:

The Poets life, the gods companion,

The fire-reuiuing Phaenix ſun-nurſt brood.

[[Page 83]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=48)The ſpirits
eternall image, honours good.

The Balſamum which cures the ſouldiers ſcarres,

The world, diſcouering ſeamens happy ſtarres.

Idem.

A loftie ſubiect of it ſelfe doth bring,

Graue words and waightie, of it ſelfe diuine:

And makes the authors holy honour ſhine.

If ye would after aſhes liue, beware:

To do like Eroſtrate, who burnt the faire

Epheſian Temple, or to win a name

To make of braſſe a cruell calfe vntame.

K. of S.

—Incorporeall Fame

Whoſe waight conſiſts in nothing but her name,

Is ſwifter then the wind, whoſe tardy plumes

Are reeking water, and dull earthly fumes.

Ch. Marlowe.

Fame (whereof the world ſeemes to make ſuch choyce)

Is but an Eccho and an idle voyce.

S. Daniell.

Vnto this Hydra are we ſubiect ſtill,

Who dares to ſpeake, not caring good or ill.

Better it is without renowne to be,

Then be renownd for vile iniquitie.

K. of K.

—Fame the queene of immortalitie.

Ch. Fitz Ieffrey.

Death hath no dart to ſlay deſerued Fame.

Ch. Fitz.

This iealous monſter hath a thouſand eies,

Her aiery body hath a thouſand wings:

Now on the earth, now vp to heauen ſhe flies.

[[Page 84]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=49)And here and
there with euery wind ſhe flings:

Nothing ſo ſecret but to her appeareth,

And apt to credit euery thing ſhe heareth.

Foule babling, tell tale, ſecrets ſoone bewraier,

The aire bred Eccho, the ſpeaker of lies:

Shrill-ſounding trompet, truths vnkind betraier.

Falſe larum-bell, awaking dead mens eies.

Fond pratling parrat telling all thou heareſt,

Oft furtheſt off, when as thou ſhouldſt be neareſt.

M. Drayton.

The path is ſet with danger, leads to fame,

When Minos did the Grecians flight denie,

He made him wings and mounted through the skie.

Idem.

Still fame wil grow if once abroad it flie,

Whether it be a troth, or be a lie.

Idem.

Fame doth explore what lies moſt ſecret hidden,

Entring the cloſet of the pallace dweller,

A broad reuealing what i [...] forbidden,

Of truth and falſhood both an equall teller,

Tis not a guard can ſerue for to expell her:

The ſword of iuſtice cannot cut her wings,

Nor ſtoppe her mouth from vttering ſecret things.

S. Daniell.

Celeſtiall goddeſſe euer-liuing fame,

Mineruaes daughter by faire Maias ſonne,

Of all th'inhabitants of heauens faire frame:

Moſt highly honored ſince the world begunne,

And ſhall be till the fatall glaſſe be runne.

Soules ſweet receit, the healths reſtoratiue:

[[Page 85]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=49)Hearts
cordiall, the minds preſeruatiue.

Goddeſſe of thoughts, muſe animating appetite,

Aulter of honour, ſimple of renowne,

Shrine of deuotion, yeelding art her merite:

Lifes richeſt treaſure, vertues gorgious gowne,

Heauens beſt abilliment, Ariadnes crowne.

The Cynoſura of the pureſt thought,

Faire Helice, by whom the heart is taught.

Ch. Fitz Ieffrey.

### 1.49. Famine.

A griſly ſhape of Famine might we ſee,

With greedy lookes and gaping mouth that cride

And would torment as ſhe ſhould there haue dide:

Her body thin and bare as any bone,

Whereto was left nought but the caſe alone:

And that alas was gnawne on euery where,

All full of holes, that I ne mought refraine

From teares to ſee how ſhe her armes could teare,

And with her teeth gnaſh on her bones in vaine,

When all for nought ſhe faine would ſo ſuſtaine

Her ſtaruen corps, that rather ſeem'd a ſhade,

Then any ſubſtance of a creature made.

Great was her force, whom ſtone walles could not ſtay,

Her tearing nayles ſnatching at all ſhe ſawe:

With gaping iawes, that by no meanes y may

Be ſatisfied from hunger of her mawe,

But eates her ſelfe, as ſhe that hath no lawe:

Gnawing alas her carkas all in vaine,

While you may count each ſinew, bone and vaine:

On her, while we thus firmly fixt our eie,

[[Page 86]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=50)That bled
for  [...]uth of ſuch a drery ſight,

Lo ſuddenly ſhe ſhrikte in ſo huge wiſe,

As made hell gates to ſhiuer with the might:

Where with a dart we ſawe how it did light

Right on his breſt, and therewithall pale death

Enthrilling it, to reaue her of her breath.

M. Sackuile.

Meane cates are welcome ſtill to hungry gueſts.

B. Ioh.

### 1.50. Fancie.

Fancie we feele includes all paſſions might.

S. Phil. Sydney.

Fancie by kind, with reaſon ſtriueth ſtill.

Th. Watſon.

—Vid. loue

### 1.51. Fate.

What God hath ſaid, that cannot but enſue,

Though all the world would haue it ouerthrowne:

When men ſuppoſe by fetches of their owne

To flie their Fate, they further on the ſame,

Like blaſts of winde, which oft reuiue the flame.

M. of M.

The heauens do rule in their continuall courſe,

That yeelds to Fate, that doth not yeeld to force.

M. Drayton.

Chaunce is vncertaine, fortune double faced.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

—Demogorgon ruler of the Fates.

R. Greene.

—The Fates can make

[[Page 87]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=50)Waie for
themſelues, their purpoſe to pertake.

Ed. Spencer.

—What the Fates do once decree,

Not all the gods can chaunge, nor Ioue himſelf can free.

Idem.

—The lawes of Fate

Being grau'n in ſteele, muſt ſtand inuiolate.

Th. Dekkar.

Who can eſcape what his owne Fate hath wrought,

The work of heauens wil, ſurpaſſe all humane thought.

Ed. Spencer.

—Who can deceiue his deſtenie?

Or weene by warning to auoid his Fate?

That when he ſleepes in more ſecuritie

And ſafeſt ſeemes, him ſooneſt doth amate,

And findeth due effect, or ſoone or late

So feeble is the power of fleſhly arme.

Idem.

—Indeed the Fates are firme,

And may not ſhrinke though all the word do ſhake:

Yet ought mens good endeuours them confirme,

And guide the heauenly cauſes to their cōſtant terme.

Idem.

Each man they ſay his Fate hath in his hands,

And what he makes or marres to leeſe or ſaue,

Of good or euil, is euen ſelfe do, ſelfe haue.

I. H. M. of M.

The Fates farre off, foreſeene come gently neare.

M. Drayton.

Our Fate is not preuented though fore-knowne,

For that muſt hap decreed by heauenly powers,

Who worke our fall, yet make the fault ſtill ours.

S. Daniell.

—Fate

Keeps in eternall darke our fortunes hidden,

And ere they come to know them, tis forbidden.

Idem.

All men are men in ignorance of Fate,

To alter chance, exceedeth humane ſtate.

I. Markham.

The heauens do rule in their continuall courſe,

That yeelds to Fate, that doth not yeeld to force.

M. Drayton.

### 1.52. Feare.

—Feare all arm'd from top to toe,

Yet thought himſelfe not ſafe enough thereby,

But fear'd each ſhadow mouing too and fro,

And his owne armes whom gliſtering he did ſpie,

Or claſhing heard, he faſt away did flie

As aſhes pale of hew, and winghie heeld,

And euermore on danger fixt his eie,

Gainſt whom he alwaies bent a brazen ſheeld,

Which his right hand vnarmed faithfully did weeld.

Ed. Spencer.

Who ſo for fickle feare from vertue ſhrinkes,

Shall in his life imbrace no worthy thing,

No mortall man the cup of ſuretie drinkes.

S. Phil. Sid.

Feare is more paine then is the paine it feares,

Diſarming humane minds of natiue might:

Where each conceit an vgly figure beares,

Which were not euil, well viewd in reaſons light.

Idem.

[[Page 89]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=51)

The gift being great, the feare doth ſtill exceed,

And extreame feare can neither fight nor flie,

But cowardlike with trembling terror die.

W. Shakeſpeare.

The feare of ill, exceeds the ill we feare.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

Feare lendeth wings to aged folke to flie,

And made them mount to places that were hie.

Feare made the wofull child to waile and weepe,

For want of ſpeed, on foote and hands to creepe.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Feare in a fearefull heart, frets more then plagues that he feareth.

A. Fraunce.

Feare that is wiſer then the truth doth ill.

S. D.

Feare caſts too deepe, and neuer is too wiſe.

Idem.

In vaine with terror is he fortified,

That is not guarded with firme loue beſide.

Idem.

A fearefull thing to tumble from a throne.

M. Drayton.

Where crowned might, & croſſed right ſo near togither dwel

Behoues that forreſt flying feare whereof the Foxe doth tel,

Our factious Lancaſter & Yorke, thereof could witnes wel.

VV. Warner.

Thunder affrights the Infants in the ſchooles,

And threatnings are the conquerors of fooles.

I. Markham.

Whom feare conſtraines to praiſe their Princes deeds,

[[Page 90]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=52)That feare
eternall, hatted in them feeds.

R. Greene.

Feare miſinterprets things, each angury

The worſer way he fondly doth imply.

Weaknes is falſe, and faith in cowards rare,

Feare findes our ſhifts, timitidie is ſubtill.

S. Daniell.

Tis incident to thoſe whom many feare,

Many to them more greeuous hate to beare.

M. Drayton.

—He whom all men feare,

Feareth all men euery where:

(Hate inforcing them thereto)

Maketh many vndertake

Many things they would not do.

Th. Kyd.

The only good that growes of paſſed feare,

Is to be wiſe, and ware of like againe.

Ed. Spencer.

A man to feare a womans moodie eire,

Makes reaſon lie a ſlaue to ſeruile feare.

S. Ph. Sydney.

Nothing ſeene fearefull, we the moſt ſhould feare,

Great amiſtes riſe before the greateſt raine:

The water deep'ſt, where we leaſt murmure heare,

In faireſt Cups men temper deadlieſt baine.

The nearer night, the ayre more cleare and ſtill,

The nearer to one deaths, leaſt fearing ill.

M. Drayton.

— Bloodleſſe, truſtleſſe, witleſſe feare,

That like an Aſpen tree, trembles each where,

She leads blacke terror, and blacke clowniſh ſhame,

[[Page 91]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=52)And drowſie
ſloth that counterfeiteth lame,

With ſnailelike motion meaſuring the ground.

Foule ſluggiſh drone, barren (but ſinne to breed)

Diſeaſed begger, ſteru'd with wilfull need.

I. S. Tranſl.

The feare of euill doth affright vs more,

Then th' euill it ſelfe, though it ſeeme nere ſo ſore.

### 1.53. Fortitude.

Rich buskind Seneca, that did declaime

And firſt in Rome our tragicke pompe compile,

Saith Fortitude is that, which in extreame,

And certaine hazard all baſe feare exile.

It guides ſaith he, the noble minde from farre,

Through froſt and fire, to conquer honours warre.

I. Markham.

Honey tong'd Tully Marmaid of our eares,

Affirmes, no force can force true Fortitude:

It with out bodies no communion beares.

The ſoule and ſpirit, ſoly it doth include.

It is that part of honeſtie, which reares

The heart to heauen, and euer doth obtrude,

Faint feare and doubt, ſtill taking his delight

In pe [...]ills, which exceed all perils might.

Patience, perſeuerance, greatnes, and ſtrong truſt,

Theſe Pages are to Fortitude their King:

Patience that ſuffers, and eſteemeth iuſt,

[[Page 92]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=53)What euer we
for vertue fortunes brine.

Perſeuerance holds conſtant what we muſt,

Greatnes that effects the guilded thing,

And armed truſt which neuer can diſpaire,

And hopes good happe how euer fatall deare.

Idem.

The man that hath of Fortitude and might,

And thereto hath a Kingdome voyd withall,

Except he alſo guide himſelfe aright,

His power and ſtrength preuaileth but a ſmall,

He cannot ſcape at length, an hapleſſe fall.

I. H. M. of M.

The Romaine Sergius hauing loſt his hand,

Slew with one hand foure in a ſingle fight,

A thing all reaſon euer did withſtand,

But that bright Fortitude ſpreads forth her light.

Pompey by ſhore held from th'Italian Land,

And all his ſaylors quaking in his ſight,

Firſt hoyſed ſailes, and cried amidſt the ſtrife,

Ther's need I goe, no need to ſaue my life.

I. Markeham.

Force without wiſedome, is of little worth.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Greater force there needs to maintain wrōg thē right.

Ed. Spencer.

Agis that guilt the Lacedemon ſtreete,

Entending one day battaile with his foes,

By counſell was repeld as thing vnmeete,

The enemie being ten to one in ſhoes,

But he replied, tis needfull that his feete

With many heads, ſhould lead to many blowes.

[[Page 93]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=53)And one
being good, an armie is for ten:

Foes to Religion, and knowne naughtie men,

To him that told Dineceus how his foes

Couered the ſunne with darts and armed ſpeares.

He made replie, thy newes is ioy in woes,

Wee'le in the ſhadow fight, and conquer foes.

I. Markham.

— As to loue, the life for vertues flame,

Is the iuſt act of a true noble will:

So to contemne it, and her hopes exclude

Is baſeneſſe, raſhneſſe, and no Fortitude.

Idem.

Raſh Iſadas the Lacedemon Lord,

That naked fought againſt the Theban power,

Although they chain'd his valour by a cord,

Yet was he finde for raſhnes in that hower.

And thoſe which moſt his careleſſe praiſe afford,

Did moſt condemne what folly did deuoure:

For in attempting, proweſſe is not ment,

But wiſely doing what we do attempt.

Idem.

### 1.54. Felicitie.

O had Felicitie feeling of woe?

Or could on meane but moderately feede?

Or would looke downe the way that he muſt goe?

Or could abſtaine from what diſeaſes breede?

To ſtop the wound before to death it bleede?

Warre ſhould not fill Kings pallaces with mone,

Nor perill come, when tis leaſt thought vpon.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 94]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=54)

### 1.55. Folly Fooles.

Folly in youth is ſinne, in age is madnes.

S. Daniel.

A greater ſigne of Folly is not ſhowne,

Then truſting others force, diſtruſt our owne:

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

— Wicked men repine their ſinnes to heare,

And Folly flings, if counſell touch him neare.

D. Lodge.

Faire fooles delight to be accounted wiſe.

Ch. Marlowe.

Fooles will find fault without the cauſe diſcerning.

And argue moſt of that they haue no learning.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

— There is a method, time, and place,

Which fooles obſeruing do cōmence, ere wiſe mē haue their grace.

W. Warner.

Tis better be a foole then be a foxe,

For Folly is rewarded and reſpected,

Where ſubtiltie is hated and reiected.

D. Lodge▪

— The fooliſh commmons vſe

Obey them moſt, who doth them moſt abuſe.

S. I. Harrington. P.

A witleſſe foole may euery man him geſſe,

That leaues the more, and takes him to the leſſe.

G. Gaſcoigne.

### 1.56. Flatterer.

— Foule leaſings and vile flatterie,

Two filthy blots in noble genterie.

Ed. Sp.

[[Page 95]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=54)

When as we finely ſoothe our owne deſires,

Our beſt conceits do proue the greateſt hers.

M. Drayton.

Nere was pretence ſo foule, but ſome would flatter it▪

Nor any thing ſo peſtilent, as miſapplied wit.

W. Warner.

To be officious, getteth friends, plaine dealing hated is

Yet better plainly to reproue, then fainedly to kis:

We cannot alſo loue our friends, & Flatter their amis.

Idem.

— Flattery can neuer want rewards.

D. Lodge.

He twice offends, who ſinne in flattery beares,

Yet euery houre he dies, who euer feares.

D. Lodge.

The Lords & Ladies ouer rent, and cunningly the fine,

The Paraſite doth ouerreach, and bears away the gain.

W. Warner.

Yee ſonnes of craft bearing as many faces,

As Proteus, takes among the marine places,

And force your natures all the beſt you can,

To counterfeit the grace of ſome great man

Chamelion like, who takes him in each hew,

Of blacke or white, or yellow, greene, or blew,

That comes him next, ſo you that finde the faſhion

To hurt the poore, with many a great taxation,

You that do preaſe to haue the princes eare,

To make your names in prouinces appeare,

Ye ſubtill Thurins ſell your fumiſh winde

To wicked wights, whoſe ſences ye do blinde.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

[[Page 96]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=55)

Time fawning ſpaniels, Mermaids on the earth.

Trencher fed flies.

Baſe Paraſites, theſe elbowe-rubbing mates,

A plague to all laſciuious wanton ſtates:

O filthy monkies, vile and beaſtly kind,

Foule prating Parrats, birds of Harpy brood,

A coraſiue to euery noble minde.

Vipers that ſucke your mothers deareſt blood:

Miſhapen monſter, worſt of any creature,

A foe to all, an enemie to nature.

M. Drayton.

### 1.57. Fortune.

Fortune as blinde as he whom ſhe doth lead,

Her feature chaung'd each minute of the houre,

Her riggiſh feete fantaſtickly would tread:

Now would ſhe ſmile, and ſuddenly would lowre,

And with one breath, her words are ſweete and ſowre.

Vpon her foes ſhe amorouſly doth glaunce,

And on her followers coyly looke aſkaunce,

About her necke (it ſeem'd as for a chaine)

Some Princes crownes and broken ſcepters hung.

Vpon her arme a lazie youth did leane,

Which ſcornfully vnto the ground ſhe flung,

And with a wanton grace paſſing alone,

Great bags of gold from out her boſome drew,

And to baſe Peſants and fond Idiots threw.

A duskie vale which hid her ſightleſſe-eies

Like cloudes, which couer our vncertaine liues,

Painted about with bloodie Tragedies,

Fooles wearing crowns and wiſe men clog'd in giue [...]

[[Page 97]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=55)Now how ſhe
giues againe, how ſhe depriues:

In this blacke map this ſhe her might diſcouers,

In Camps and Courts, on ſouldiers, and on louers.

M. Drayton.

A hap, a chaunce, a caſuall euent,

The vulgars Idoll, and a childiſh terror:

A what man will, a ſilly accident

The maske of blindneſſe, and diſguiſe of error,

Natures vile nickname, follies fooliſh mirror:

A terme, a by-word, by tradition learn'd,

A hearſay, nothing not to be diſcernd,

A wanton feare, a ſilly Infants dreame,

A vaine illuſion, a meere fantaſie:

A ſeeming ſhade, a lunaticke mans dreame.

A fond Aenigma, a flat hereſie.

Imaginations doting emperie.

A folly in it ſelfe, it one ſelfe loathing,

A thing that would be, and yet can be nothing.

Diſeaſe of time, ambitions concubine:

A minde intrancing ſnare, a ſlippery yce,

The bait of death, deſtructions heady wine.

Vaine-glories patron, the fooles paradice.

Fond hope wherewith confuſion doth intice.

A vile ſeducing f [...]end, which haunts men ſtill,

To looſe them in the errors of their will.

Idem.

O fortune the great Amorite of kings,

Opinions breath, thou Epicurian aire:

Inuention of mans ſoule, falſeſt of things,

A ſtep beyond our iudgement, and a ſtaire

Higher then men can reach with reaſons wings.

[[Page 98]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=56)Thou
blindfold Archereſſe, thou that wilt not heare:

Thou foe to perſons, manners, times and all,

That raiſeſt worthleſſe, while the worthieſt fall.

I. Markham.

Ah fortune, nurſe of fooles, poyſon of hope,

Fuell of vaine deſires, deſerts deſtruction▪

Suppoſed ſoueraigne, through our vaine conſtruction

Princes of Paganiſme, roote of impie [...]ie,

Diuell on earth, masked in pietie.

Scorne of the learned, follies elder ſcholler,

Baſtard of time, begot by vaine opinion:

Againſt thy power, a peeuiſh proud reſiſter.

Mother of lies, and witneſſe of illuſion:

Lampe of vain-glory, double faced ſhroe,

Who ſmiles at firſt, ſuccesfull, ends in woe.

D. Lodge.

Who wins her grace, muſt with atchiuements wo he [...]

As ſhe is blind, ſo neuer had ſhe eares,

Nor muſt with puling eloquence go to her:

She vnderſtands not ſighes, ſhe heares not praiers.

Flattered ſhe flies; controld ſhe euer feares.

And though a while ſhe nicely do forſake it,

She i [...] a woman, and at length will take it.

Nor euer let him dreame once of a crowne,

For one bad caſt that will giue vp his game,

And though by ill hap he be ouerthrowne,

Yet let him manage her till ſhe be tame.

M. Drayton.

Fortune the folly is, and plague of thoſe

Which to the world their wretched will diſpoſe.

M. of M.

[[Page 99]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=56)

All fleſh is fraile and full of fickleneſſe,

Subiect to fortunes charme, ſtill changing new,

What haps to day to me, to morrow may to you.

Ed. Spencer.

Fortune the foe to famous chieuiſance,

Sildome or neuer yeelds to vertue aide:

But in her way throwes miſchiefe and miſchance,

Whereby her courſe is ſtopt, and paſſage laide.

Idem.

Mocke Gods they are, and many Gods induce,

Who fortune faine to father there abuſe.

M. of M.

—In vaine do men

The heauens of there fortunes fault accuſe,

Syth they know beſt what is the beſt for them,

For they to each ſuch fortune do diffuſe,

As they do know each can moſt aptly vſe:

For not that which men couet moſt is beſt,

Nor that thing worſt which men do moſt refuſe.

But fitteſt is, that all contented reſt

With that they hold: each hath his fortune in his breſt.

Ed. Spencer.

No fortune is ſo bad, our ſelues ne frame

There is no chance at all hath vs preſeru'd.

There is no fate whom we haue need to blame:

There is no deſteny but is deſeru'd:

No lucke that leaues vs ſafe, or vnpreſeru'd.

Let vs not then complaine of fortunes skill,

For all our good deſcends from Gods good will,

And of our lewdneſſe, ſpringeth all our ill.

M. of M.

[[Page 100]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=57)

—They that do dwell on fortunes call,

No ſooner riſe, but ready are to fall.

D. Lodge.

Looke how much higher fortune doth erect

The climing wight on her vnſtable wheele:

So much the nigher may a man exſpect

To ſee his head where late he ſawe his heele.

Policrates hath prou'd it in effect,

And Dyoniſius that too true did feele

Who long were luld on hie in fortunes lap:

And fell downe ſuddenly to great miſhap.

On th'other ſide, the more man is oppreſſed

And vtterly ouerthrowne by fortunes lowre,

The ſooner comes his ſtate to be redreſſed,

When wheele ſhall turn and bring the happie howre.

Some from the Blocke haue growne to be ſo bleſſed.

Whole realmes haue bene ſubuerted to their powre.

As Marius and Ʋentidius ſample is,

In former age, and Lewes of France in this.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

—As the boyſtrous winde

Doth ſhake the tops of higheſt reared towers,

So doth the force of froward fortune ſtrike

The wight that higheſt ſits in haughtie ſtate.

G. Gaſcoigne.

—So wills the wanton queene of chance,

That each man trace this Labyrinth of life:

With ſlippery ſteps now wrongd by fortune ſtrange,

Now drawne by counſell from the maze of ſtrife.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 101]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=57)

We all are proud when fortune fauours vs,

As if inconſtant chaunce were alwaies one:

Or ſtanding now, ſhe would continue thus,

O fooles looke backe, and ſee the rolling ſtone

Whereon ſhe blindly lighting ſets her foote,

And ſlightly ſowes, that ſildome taketh roote.

Th. Kyd.

Fortune the firſt and laſt that gouernes ſtates.

I. Markham.

The blind-fold miſtreſſe of vncertaine chaunge.

D. Lodge.

The wayward lady of this wicked world.

Idem.

Blind fortune faileth mighty ones, & meaner doth aduance.

W. Warner.

Blind fortune findeth none ſo fit to flout

As Sures by ſotts, which caſt no kind of doubt.

M. of M.

—Fortune cannot raiſe

Any one aloft without ſome others wracke,

Flouds drowne no fields vnleſſe they finde a bracke.

Idem.

Where power dwelles and riches reſt,

Falſe fortune is a comely gueſt.

E. of S.

Think fortune newly hatcht is fledge, & waggeth wing to flie

All ſuffer chāge, our ſelues new born, euen then begin to die.

VV. VVarner.

The man that fortune at commaund will keepe,

He muſt be ſure he neuer let her ſleepe.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 102]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=58)

There neuer yet was Emperour or King,

Could boaſt that he had fortune in a ſtring.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

—All things to fortune are ſubiected,

Chiefly in warres, that are by chaunce directed.

Idem.

Whereſoeuer fortune her bountie will beſtow,

There heauen and earth muſt pay what ſhe doth owe.

M. of M.

The man whoſe thoughts to fortunes height aſpires,

Were better die then liue in lowe deſires.

Th. Achelly.

Admit thou hadſt Pactolian waues to land thee gold at will,

Know Craeſus did to Cyrus kneele, and thou maiſt ſpeed as ill.

W. Warner.

Attempt not things beyond thy reach, ioyne fortune to thy will,

Leaſt Phebus chaire do els ſurcharge raſh Phaethon his skill

Idem.

If fortune help whō thou woldſt hurt, fret not at it the more,

When Aiax ſtorm'd, then from him the prize Vliſſes bore.

Idem.

Good fortune drawes from heauen her deſcent,

Making hie Ioue the roote of her large tree:

She ſhowes from him how many Godheads went,

Archangels, Angels, heauens poſteritie,

From thence ſhe ſhowes the glorious thrid ſhe lent,

To Monarkes, Emperours and Kings in fee.

Annexing as collateralls to her loue,

Honour, vertue, valour and endleſſe time.

N [...]theleſſe ill fortune will be elder borne

She ſaith ſhe ſprings from Saturne, Ioues wrongd ſyre,

[[Page 103]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=58)And heauen
and earth, and hell, her coate haue borne

Freſh bleeding hearts within a field of fyre:

All that the world admires ſhe makes her ſcorne,

Who fartheſt ſeemes, is to ill fortune neere.

And that iuſt proofe may her great praiſe commend,

All that good chaunce begins, ill chaunce doth end.

I. Markham.

Ill fortune is attended by reproach,

Good fortune fame and vertue ſtellifies.

Idem.

—What man can ſhun the happe,

That hidden lies, vnwares him to ſurpriſe:

Misfortune waits aduantage to entrappe

The man moſt wary, in her whelming lappe.

Ed. Spencer.

The fortune that misfortune doth affoord,

Is for to liue and die vnfortunate.

Th. Achelly.

Misfortune followeth him that tempteth fortune.

Ch. Fitz Ieffrey.

### 1.58. Friendſhip. Friends.

The naturall affection ſoone doth ceaſe,

And quenched is with Cupids greater flame:

But faithfull friendſhip doth them both ſuppreſſe:

And them with maiſtring diſcipline doth tame

Through thoughts aſpiring, to eternall fame.

Ed. Spencer.

In friendſhip, ſoueraigne 'tis as Mithridate,

Thy friend to loue, as one whom thou maiſt hate.

M. of M.

[[Page 104]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=59)

Ne certes can that friendſhip long endure,

How euer gay and goodly be the ſtyle,

That doth ill cauſe or euill end endure,

For vertue is the band which bindeth hearts moſt ſure.

Ed. Spencer.

— Enmitie that of no ill proceeds,

But of occaſion, with the occaſion ends,

And friendſhip which a faint affection breeds,

Without regard of good, lies like ill grounded ſeed.

Ed. Spencer.

With vertue chuſe thy friend, with vertue him retaine,

Let vertue be the ground, ſo ſhall it not be vaine.

S. Th. VViat.

Try frends by touch, a feeble frēd may proue thy ſtrōgeſt foe▪

Great Pompeys head to Caeſars hand, it was betraied ſo,

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

In perfect friendſhip no ſuſpect, for two in one are all,

Communitie, or doubling ioy, or making griefe more ſmall.

Idem.

The trueſt friendſhip in miſerie is tride,

For then will none but faithfull friends abide,

G. Turberuile.

Right true it is, and ſaid full yore agoe,

Take heed of him that by the backe thee claweth,

For none is worſe, then is the friendly foe,

Though thee ſeeme good, all things yt thee delighteth:

Yet know it well, that in thy boſome creepeth,

For many a man ſuch fiers oft times hee kindleth,

That with the blaze his beard himſelfe he ſingeth.

E. of Surrey.

[[Page 105]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=59)

None can deeme right who faithfull friends do reſt,

While they beare ſway and rule in hie degree:

For then both faſt and fained friends are preſt.

Whoſe faiths ſeeme both of one effect to bee.

But then reuolts the firſt and fained gueſt,

When wealth vnwindes and fortune ſeemes to flie,

But he that loues indeed, remaineth faſt,

And loues and ſerues when life and all is paſt.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Oft times we ſee in houſe of meane eſtate,

In fortunes bad, and chances ouerthwart:

That men do ſooner laie away debate,

And ioyne in ſound accord with hand and hart,

Then Princes courts, where riches genders hate:

And vile ſuſpect that louing minds doth part.

Where charitie is cleane conſumde and vaniſhed,

And friendſhip firme, is quite caſt out and baniſhed.

Idem.

Who ſo wants friends to backe what he begins,

In lands farre off, gets not, although he wins.

S. Daniell.

If fortune friendly fawne, and lend thee wealthy ſtore,

Thy frends conioined ioy, doth make thy ioy the more

If frowardly ſhe frowne, and driueth to diſtreſſe:

His aide releeues thy ruth, and makes thy ſolace leſſe.

S. Th. Wiat.

They are not alwaies ſureſt friends on whō we moſt do ſpend.

W. VVarner.

True friends haue feeling of each others wo,

And when ones hart is ſad, all theirs is ſo.

Ch. Middleion.

[[Page 106]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=60)

A golden treaſure is the  [...]ried friend,

But who may gold from counterfeits defend?

Truſt not to ſoone, nor yet to ſoone miſtruſt,

With th'one thy ſelfe, with th'other thy friend thou hurtſt,

Who twines betwixt, & ſtears the goldē mean,

Nor raſhly loueth, nor miſtruſts in vaine.

Mir. of M.

— Friends are geaſon now a daies,

And growe to fume before they taſte the fier:

Aquerſitie bereauing mans auailes,

They flie like feathers dallying in the winde.

They riſe like bubbles in a ſtormy raine,

Swelling in words, and flying faith and deeds.

D. Lodge.

Faint friends when they fall out, moſt cruel foemen be.

Ed. Spencer.

Better a new friend, then an old foe is ſaid.

Idem.

### 1.59. Frugalitie.

He that will thriue, muſt thinke no courſes vile.

B. Iohnſon.

No hurt but good (who meanes to multiplie)

Bought wit is deare, and dreſt with ſower ſauce,

Repentance comes too late, and then ſay I,

Who ſpares the firſt, and keepes the laſt vnſpent▪

Shall find that ſparing yeelds a goodly rent.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Let firſt thine owne hand hold faſt all that comes,

But let the other learne his letting flie:

Idem.

[[Page 107]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=60)

### 1.60. Furie.

— Furie furiouſly mans life aſſailes

With thouſand cannons, ſooner felt then ſeene,

Where weakeſt, ſtrongeſt, fraught with deadly teene,

Blind, crooked, bliſterd, melancholy, ſad,

Many-nam'd poyſon, miniſter of death,

Which from vs creepes, but to vs gallopeth.

Foule, trouble reſt, phantaſticke, greedy-gut,

Bloud ſweating, hearts-theefe, wretched, filthy-ſlut

The childe of ſurfait and aires-temper vicious,

Perillous knowne, but vnknowne moſt pernicious.

I. Syluister.

— Furie cruell curſed wight,

That vnto Knighthood workes much ſhame and woe,

And that ſame hag, his aged mother hight,

Occaſion, the roote of all wrath and diſpight.

With her, who ſo will raging Furie tame,

Muſt firſt begin, and welther amenage,

Firſt her reſtraine from her reproachfull blame

And euill meanes, with which ſhe doth enrage

Her franticke ſonne, and kindles his courage,

Then when ſhe is withdrawne, or ſtrong withſtood,

Is eath his Idle Furie to aſſwage,

And calme this tempeſt of his paſſion wood,

The bankes are ouerflowne, when ſo ſped is the flood.

Ed. Spencer.

Furie was red with rage, his eyes did glowe,

While flakes of fier from forth his mouth did flowe

His hands and armes y bath'd in bloud of thoſe

Whom fortune, ſinne, or fate made countries foes.

T. Lodge.

[[Page 108]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=61)

—This fell fury, for forerunner ſends

Manie and phrenzie, to ſubborne her frends,

Whereof the one drying, th'other ouerwarming.

The feeble brain (the edge of iudgement harming)

Within the ſoule phantaſtickly they faine,

A confus'd hoaſt of ſtrange Chimeraes vaine.

I. Syluister.

### 1.61. Gifts.

Tis wiſedome to giue much, a Gift preuailes,

When deepe perſwading Oratorie failes.

Ch. Marlowe.

A giuing hand though foule, ſhall haue faire praiſe.

S. Daniell.

— The greateſt Gifts whereof we boaſt,

Are thoſe which do attempt and tire vs moſt.

T. Lodge.

— Onely wiſedome graue, and iudgements cleere,

Gifts giu'n from heauen, that are not common heere.

S. I. H. Tranſl.

Goods Gifts are often giuen to men paſt good.

G. Chapman.

Good Gifts abus'd, to mans confuſion turne.

Th. Dekkar.

Testators and Executors ſo giue and ſo receaue,

As doubtful whethers ioy or griefe, is more to take or leaue

For as do hogs their troghs to hoūds, ſo theſe giue & get place

Death not the Dier giues bequeſts, and therfore but graue grace.

W. Warner.

To loiter well deſerued Gifts, is not to giue but ſell,

When to requite ingratitude, were to do euill well.

Idem.

### 1.62. Gentleneſſe.

The gentle minde by gentle deeds is knowne,

For a man by nothing is ſo well bewraide,

As by his maners, in which plaine is ſhowne,

Of what degree, and what race he is growne.

Ed. Spencer.

Sweete gentleneſſe is Bewties waiting maide.

Th. Ʋ Ʋatſon.

— In gentle thoughts,

Relenting thoughts, remorſe, and pittie reſts.

Ch. Marlowe.

All like as Phoebus, with his chearefull beames,

Doth freſhly force the fragrant flowers to flouriſh,

So gentle rulers ſubiects loue do nouriſh.

I. H. Mir. of M.

Like as the gentle heart it ſelfe bewraies,

In doing gentle deeds with francke delight:

Euen ſo the baſer minde it ſelfe diſplaies,

In canckered malice, and reuenge for ſpight.

W. Shakeſpeare.

O what an eaſie thing is't to diſcrie

The gentle bloud, how euer it be wrapt,

In ſad miſfortunes foule deformitie

And wretched ſorrowes which haue often hapt.

For howſoeuer it may grow miſhapt,

That to all vertue it may ſeeme vnapt,

Yet will it ſhew ſome ſparkes of gentle minde,

And at the laſt, breake forth in his owne proper kinde.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 110]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=62)

### 1.63. Gentrie.

—True Gentrie ſtandeth in the trade

Of vertuous life, not in the fleſhly line,

For bloud is knit, but Gentrie is diuine.

I. H. M. of M.

Aboue cognizance or armes, or pedigree farre,

An vnſpotted coate, is like a blazing ſtarre.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Kind Amalthea was tranſformd by Ioue,

Into his ſparkling pauement, for his loue,

Though but a goate, and giuing him her milke,

Bazenes is flinty Gentrie, ſoft as ſilke.

In heauen ſhe liues, and rules a liuing ſigne

In humane bodies: yet not ſo diuine,

That ſhe can worke her kindnes in our hearts.

G. Chapman.

The true Gentilitie by their owne armes

Aduance themſelues, the falls by others harmes.

Th. Baſtard.

### 1.64. Gluttonie.

— By his ſide rode loathſome Gluttonie,

Deformed creature, on a filthy ſwine:

His belly was vpblowen with luxurie,

And eke with fatnes, ſwollen were his eine.

And like a Crane, his necke was long and fine,

With which he ſwallowed vp exceſſiue feaſt,

For want of which, poore people oft did pine,

And all the way moſt like a brutiſh ſwine,

He ſpued vp his gorge, that all did him deteſt.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 111]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=62)

Fat paunches haue leane pates, and daintie bits

Make rich the ribs, but bankrout quite the wits.

W. Shakespeare.

Your appetites O gluttons to content,

The ſacred breaſt of Thetis blew, is rent:

The aire muſt be diſpeopled for your mawes,

The Phoenix ſole can ſcarce eſcape your clawes.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Of little nature liues, ſuperfluous meate

But dulls the ſpirit, and doth the ſtomacke freate.

Idem.

Ʋ Ʋho fareth fineſt, doth but feed, and ouerfeedeth oft,

Who ſleepeth ſoftest doth but ſleep, and ſometimes ouerſoft.

VV. vvarner.

— Exceſſe doth worke acceſſe to ſinne.

Idem.

O plague, O poyſon to the warlike ſtate,

Thou mak'ſt the noble hearts effeminate,

While Rome was rul'd by Curioes and Fabrices,

Who fed on rootes, and ſought not for delices.

And when the onely Creſſons was the foode,

Moſt delicate to Perſia then they ſtoode

In happie ſtate, renown'd in peace and warre,

And through rhe world their triumphs ſpread a farre.

But when they after in th'Aſſirian hall,

Had heard the leſſons of Sardanopall,

And when the other giuen to belly-cheare,

By Galbaes, Neroes, Ʋitels gouern'd were,

Who gloried more to fill a coſtly plate,

Then kill a Pirrhus or a Mithridate.

[[Page 112]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=63)Then both
of them were ſeene for to be ſacked

By nations poore, whom they before had wracked.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

O glutton throates, O greedie guts profound,

The choſen meates which in the world his bound,

By th' Abderois inuented, may not ſtanch

Nor ſatiſfie your foule deuouring panch,

But muſt in Moluke ſeeke the ſpices fine,

Canary ſuger, and the Candy wine.

Idem.

Fatneſſe by nature (not immoderate)

Kils not the wit, quels not the mindes eſtate.

But fatnes by intemperance increaſt,

When liuing man reſembſeth loathſome beaſt:

And belly cheare, with greedie gluttonie

Is held the fulneſſe of felicitie.

This maketh men addicted to the ſame,

Dull in conceit, groſſe minded, worthy blame.

Of ſuch do Baſis, Galen, Plato write:

That fatteſt belly hath the weakeſt ſprite.

D. Lodge.

— O ſhort, ô dangerous madneſſe,

That in thy rage doeſt truſtie Clytus ſmother,

By his deare friend: Panthea by his mother.

Phrenzie, that makes the vaunter inſolent,

The talkefull blab, cruell and violent,

The fornicator waxe adulterous,

Th'adulterer to become inceſtuous,

With thy plagues leuen, ſwelling all our crimes

Blinde, ſhameleſſe, ſenſleſſe, quenching oftentimes

[[Page 113]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=63)The ſoule
within it ſelfe: and oft defames

The holieſt men, with execrable flames.

I. Silueſter.

Like as the muſt beginning to reboyle,

Makes his new veſſell wood-bands to recoyle:

Lifts vp his lees, and ſpues with fuming vent,

From this tubbes ground his ſcumming excrement.

So ruiniſt thou thy hoaſt, and fooliſhly

From his hearts bottome driu'ſt all ſecrecy.

Idem.

### 1.65. Good name.

The voyce that goeth of your vnſpotted fame,

Is like a tender flowre, that with the blaſt

Of euery little winde doth fade away.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

The pureſt treaſure mortall times affoord,

Is ſpotleſſe reputation, that away,

Men are but guilded trunkes, or painted clay.

W. Shakeſpeare.

You cannot be too curious of you name,

Fond ſhow of ill (though ſtill the mind be chaſte)

Decaies the credit oft that Ladies had,

Sometimes the place preſumes a wanton minde,

Repaire ſometimes of ſome doth hurt their honour.

Sometimes the light and gariſh proud attire,

Perſwades a yeelding bent of pleaſing youthes.

G. Gaſcoigne.

### 1.66. Goodneſſe.

—Euen with Goodneſſe men grow diſcontent.

Where allare ripe to fall, and vertue ſpent.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 114]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=64)

Good things may ſcarce appeare,

But paſſe away with ſpeedie wing.

M. Roydon.

### 1.67. Of God.

I am that one, is, was, and aye ſhall be,

Who create all of nought, as pleaſeth me:

I can deſtroy, I am the great and iuſt,

The faire, the good, the holy one to truſt:

Whoſe ſtrong right hand this world hath ſet in frame.

I plague my foe, and graunt my ſeruants grace,

All thoſe that knowledge me, and all their race.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

—How ſoeuer things in likelyhood diſcent

In birth, life, death, our God is firſt, the middle and euent.

And not what he can do he will, but what he will he can,

And that he do or do it not, behoues vs not to ſcan.

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner

God firſt made Angels bodileſſe pure mindes,

Then other things, which mindleſſe bodies bee:

Laſt he made man the Horizon twixt both kindes,

In whom we do the worlds abtidgement ſee.

I. Dauies.

How fond is that man in his fantaſie

Who thinkes that Ioue the maker of vs all,

The Sunne, the Moone the Starres celeſtiall,

So that no leafe without his leaue can fall.

Hath not in him omnipotence alſo,

To guide and gouerne all things here below.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

— Heauen is his ſeate,

Th'earth his footeſtoole, and the priſon great.

[[Page 115]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=64)Of Plutoes
raigne, where damned ſoules are ſhut,

Is of his anger euermore the but.

I. Sylueſter. Tranſl.

—Full hard it is to read aright

The ſecret meaning of the eternall might:

That rules mans waies, and rules the thoughts of liuing wight.

Ed. Spencer.

The man of earth ſounds not the ſeas profound

Of Gods deepe iudgements, where there is no ground

Let ſoberr [...]eſſe be ſtill thy wiſedomes end,

Admiring that thou canſt not comprehend.

I. Sylueſter. Tran.

Vnder his feete (ſubiected to his grace,

Sit nature, fortune, motion, time, and place.

Ed. Fairfax. Tran.

—Is there care in heauen? is there loue

In the heauenly ſpirits to theſe creatures baſe,

That may compaſſion of their euils moue?

There is: els much more wretched were the caſe

Of men, then beaſts; but ô the exceeding grace

Of higheſt God, that loues his creature ſo:

And all his workes with mercy doth imbrace.

That bleſſed Angels he ſends too and fro,

To ſerue to wicked man, to ſerue his wicked foe.

Ed. Spencer.

Our gracious God makes ſcant waight of diſpleaſure,

And ſpreads his mercy without waight or meaſure,

I. Sylueſter.

The eternall power that guides the earthly frame,

And ſerues him with the inſtrument of heauen:

To call the earth, and ſummon vp our ſhame:

[[Page 116]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=65)By an edict
from euerlaſting giuen,

Forbids mortalitie to ſearch the ſame.

Where ſence is blind, and wit of wit bereauen:

Terror muſt be our knowledge, feare our skill,

To admire his worke, and tremble at his will.

S. Daniell.

—Howſoeuer things in likely hood diſcent,

In birth life, death, our god is firſt, the middle & euent

And not what he can do he wil, but what he wil he can,

And that he do or do it not, behoues vs not to ſcan.

W. Warner.

God may all that he wills, his will is iuſt,

God wills all good to them that in him truſt.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Where the Almighties lightening brand doth light,

It dimmes the daz'led eies, & daunts the ſences quight

Ed. Spencer.

—The Gods are euer iuſt,

Our faults excuſe their rigour muſt.

S. Daniell.

The Lord law-maker iuſt and righteous,

Doth frame his lawes not for himſelfe but vs:

He frees himſelfe; and flies with his powers wing,

No where but where his holy will doth bring.

All that he doth is good, becauſe it doth proceed

From him: that is the roote of good indeed

From him; that is the ſpring of righteouſneſſe:

From him, whoſe goodneſſe nothing can expreſſe.

I. Sylueſter.

[[Page 117]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=65)

—Indeed the euil done

Dies not when breath the body firſt doth leaue,

But from the granſire to the nephewes ſonne,

And all his ſeed the curſe doth often cleaue,

Till vengeance vtterly the guilt bereaue:

So ſtraightly God doth iudge.

Ed. Spencer.

There is no ſtrength in armour, man or horſe,

Can vaile, If Ioue on wronged take remorſe:

For he on whom the deadly dart doth light,

Can neuer ſcape by raunſome, friend nor flight.

I. Harr. Mir. of Mag.

Eternall prouidence exceeding thought,

Where none appeares, can make her ſelfe away.

Ed. Spencer.

If Gods can their owne excellence excell,

It's in pardoning mortalls that rebell.

M. Drayton.

God moſt doth puniſh, whom he moſt regardeth.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

—Where Gods do vengeance craue,

It is not ſtrong deenſiue walls that any thing can ſaue.

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

—God hath made a ſalue for euery ſore,

If men would learne the ſame for to apply.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Man purpoſeth, but all things are diſpoſed

By that great God that ſits and rules aboue.

Idem.

What man is he that boaſts of fleſhly might,

And vaine aſſurance of mortalitie?

[[Page 118]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=66)Which all
ſo ſoone as it doth come to fight,

Againſt ſpirituall foes, yeelds by and by,

Or from the field moſt cowardly doth flye?

Ne let the man aſcribe it to his skill,

That though grace hath gained victory.

If any ſleight we haue it is to ill,

But all the good is Gods, both power and eke the will.

Ed. Spencer.

God neuer ſeekes by tryall of temptation,

To ſound mans heart and ſecret cogitation.

For well he knowes man, and his eye doth ſee

All thoughts of men, ere they conceaued bee.

I. Sylueſter. Tranſl.

—God

Conioynes no leſſe our willes then bolds our harts,

A ſure preſage that he is on our parts.

Th. Hudſon. Tran.

Our God is iuſt, whoſe ſtroke delaid long,

Doth light at laſt with paine more ſharpe and ſtrong.

I. H. M. of Magiſt.

The miſtie cloudes that fall ſometime

And ouercaſt the skies:

Are like to troubles of our time,

Which do but dimme our eies.

But as ſuch deawes are dried vp quite

When Phebus ſhowes his face:

So are ſad fancies put to flight,

When God doth guide by grace.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Gods mercy gently waighes his iuſtice downe.

Th. A [...]helly.

So blinds the ſharpeſt counſell of the wiſe,

[[Page 119]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=66)This
ouerſhadowing prouidence on hie:

And dazeleth the cleareſt ſighted eies,

That they ſee not how nakedly they lie.

There where they little thinke the ſtorme doth riſe,

And ouercaſt their cleare ſecuritie.

When man hath ſtopt all waies ſaue only that,

That (leaſt ſuſpected) ruine enters at.

S. Daniell.

When Sathan tempts he leades vs vnto hell,

But God doth guide whereas no death doth dwell.

When Sathan tempts he ſeekes our faith to foyle,

But God doth ſeale it neuer to recoyle.

Sathan ſuggeſteth ill, good moues to grace,

The diuel ſeekes our baptiſme to deface.

But God doth make our burning zeale to ſhine,

Amongſt the candels of his Church diuine.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

—Gods word

(Which made the world, ſuſtaines and guides it ſtill)

To diuers ends conducts both good and ill.

He that preferres not God fore all his race,

Amongſt the ſonnes of God deſerues no place.

And he that plowes the furrowes of Gods feeld,

May not turne backe his fainting face nor yeeld.

Idem.

God with eternall bread in time of need,

His loued Iacob fortie yeares did feed.

And gaue them water from the ſolid ſtone,

Which of it ſelfe had neuer moyſture none.

Their caps, their coats, and ſhoes that they did weare,

God kept all freſh and new full fortie yeare.

Th. Hud. Tran.

[[Page 120]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=67)

The moſt iuſt God when once mans ſinnes do grow

Beyond the bounds of pardon and of grace:

Becauſe that men his iudgements beſt may know:

Like to his loue, to rule on earth doth place

Monſters moſt vile to tyrannize vs ſo,

With wrong the right, with luſt lawes to deface.

For this ſaid cauſe were Scylla ſent and Marius,

The Nerons both, and filthy minded Ʋarius:

For this Domitian held in Rome the raigne,

And Antoninus of that name the laſt:

And Meſſinine a baſe vnworthy ſwaine.

To place mankind in princely throne was plaſte:

For this in Thebes did cruell Creon raigne,

With other tyrants more in ages paſt.

For this of late hath Italy bene wonne,

By men of Lombardie, of Goth and Hunne.

S. Daniell.

### 1.68. Good deeds.

Who wold to God but workes no good, who ſeeketh fame by eaſe,

Comes ſhort of both, no leſſe then maps to very lands and ſeas.

VV. VVarner.

Good deeds in caſe that they be euil placed,

Ill deeds are reckoned and ſoone diſgraced.

That is a good deed that preuents a bad.

G. Chapman.

Well doing, farre exceedeth well to ſay.

G. Turberuile.

Ill deeds may better the bad words be bore.

Ed. Spencer.

Let euery one do all the good they can,

or ſildom commeth harme of doing well.

[[Page 121]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=67)Though iuſt
reward it wanteth now and than.

Yet ſhame and euill death it doth expell:

But he that miſchieueth an other man,

Seldome doth carry it to heauen or hell.

Men ſay it, and we ſee it come to paſſe,

Good turnes in duſt, and bad turnes writ in glaſſe.

S. I. Harrington. Tranſl.

Wretched is he that thinkes by doing ill,

His euill deeds long to conceale and hide:

For though the voyce and tongues of men be ſtill,

By foules and beaſts his ſinne ſhall be diſcride,

And God oft worketh by his ſecret will,

That ſinne it ſelfe, the ſinner ſo doth guide,

That of his owne accord without requeſt,

He makes his wicked doings manifeſt.

Idem.

Our bodies buried, then our deeds aſcend,

Thoſe deeds in life to worth can not be rated,

In death with life, our fame euen then is dated.

M. Drayton.

### 1.69. Greatneſſe.

Great things ſtill orewhelme themſelues by waight.

E. Guilpin.

Greatneſſe like to the ſunnes reflecting powers,

The fier bred vapours naturally exhailes,

And is the cauſe that oft the euening lowers,

When foggy miſts enlarge their duskie ſailes.

That his owne beames he in the cloudes impailes,

And either muſt extinguiſh his owne light,

Or by his vertue cauſe his proper right.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 122]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=68)

To be huge is to be deadly ſicke.

I. Marſton.

O blinded Greatneſſe, thou with thy turmoile,

Still ſelling happy life, mak'ſt life a toile.

S. Daniel.

— He that ſtriues to manage mightie things,

Amidſt his triumphes, beares a troubled minde:

The greateſt hope the greateſt harueſt brings,

And poore men in content there glory finde.

D. L [...]dge.

The man that furthereth other men to thriue,

Of priuate greatneſſe doth himſelfe depriue.

Th. Storer.

### 1.70. Griefe.

Griefe all in ſables ſorrowfully clad,

Downe hanging his dull head with heauie cheare,

Yet inly beine more, then ſeeming ſad,

A paire of pincers in his hand he had.

With which, he pinched people to the heart,

That from thenceforth, a wretched life they lad:

In wilfull languor and conſuming ſmart,

Dying each day with impair'd wounds of dolors dart.

Ed. Spencer.

Griefe onely makes his wretched ſtate to ſee,

(Euen like a toppe, which nought but whipping moues)

This man, this talking beaſt, this walking tree,

Griefe is the ſtone, which fineſt iudgements proues,

For who grieues not, hath but a blockiſh braine,

Since cauſe of Griefe we cauſe, from life remoues.

S. Ph. Sydney.

[[Page 123]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=68)

— Griefes deadly ſore,

Vnkindnes breeds, vnkindnes foſtereth hate.

Idem.

Griefe to it ſelfe moſt dreadfull doth appeare,

And neuer yet was ſorrow voyd of feare:

But yet in death, they both do hope the beſt.

M. Drayton.

Griefes be long liu'd, and ſorrowes ſeldome die.

Idem.

Griefe hath two tongues, and neuer woman yet

Could rule them both, without tenne womens wit.

W. Shakeſpeare.

He oft findes medicine, who his griefes imparts,

But double Griefe afflicts concealing harts,

As raging flames, who ſtriueth to ſuppreſſe.

Ed. Spencer.

Found neuer help, who neuer could his griefe impart.

Idem.

No greater eaſe of heart the griefes to tell,

It daunteth all the dolours of the minde:

Our carefull hearts thereby great comfort finde.

I. H. Mir. of Mag.

An Ouen that is ſtopt, or Riuer ſtaied,

Burneth more hotely, ſwelleth with more rage:

So of concealed Griefe it may be ſaid.

Free vent of words, loues fier doth aſſwage.

But when the hearts atturney once is mute,

The Client breakes, as deſperate in his ſute.

W. Shakespeare.

[[Page 124]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=69)

No one thing doth auaile man more,

To cure a griefe, and perfectly to heale it,

Then if he do vnto ſome friends reueale it.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

— Griefe it is inough to vexed wight,

To feele his fault and not be farther vext.

Fd. Spencer.

— Some griefe ſhewes much of loue,

But much to griefe ſhewes ſtill ſome want of wit.

W. Shakeſpeare.

— Great griefe can not be told,

And can more eaſily be thought then found.

Ed. Sp.

### 1.71. Paine.

Thou Paine, the onely ghueſt of loath'd conſtraint,

The child of curſe, mans weakneſſe foſter child,

Brother to woe, and father of complaint,

Thou Paine, thou loathed paine from heauen exild.

H. C.

The ſcourge of life, and deaths extreame diſgrace,

The ſmoake of hel, that monſter's called paine.

Idem.

The thing that grieuous were to do or beare

Them to renew, I wot breeds no delight.

Ed. Spencer.

True griefe is fond, and teſty as a childe,

Who wayward once, his moode with nought agrees,

Old woes not infant ſorrowes beare them milde,

Continuance tames the one, the other wilde,

Like an vnpractiz'd ſwimmer plunging ſtill

With too much labour drownes for want of skill.

W. Shakespeare.

[[Page 125]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=69)

Paine paies the income of each precious thing.

W. Sh.

### 1.72. Heauen.

From hence with grace and goodneſſe compaſt round

God ruleth, bleſſeth, keepeth, all he wrought:

Aboue the aire, the fire, the ſea, and ground,

Our ſenſe, our wit, our reaſon, and our thought:

Where perſons three, with power and glory crownd,

Are all one God, who made all things of nought.

Vnder whoſe feete ſubiected to his grace,

Sit nature, fortune, motion, time, and place.

This is the place from whence like ſmoake and duſt

Of this fraile world, the wealth, the pompe, the power

He toſſeth, humbleth, turneth as he luſt,

And guides our life, our end, our death and hower:

No eye (how euer vertuous, pure and iuſt)

Can view the brightnes, of that glorious bower,

On euery ſide the bleſſed ſpirirs bee

Equall in ioyes, though differing in degree.

E. Fairfax. Tranſl.

In this great temple, richly bewtified,

Pau'd all with ſtarres, diſperſt on Saphire flower,

The Clarke is a pure Angell ſanctified,

The Iudge our hie Meſſias full of power,

The Apoſtles, his aſſiſtance, euery hower

The Iury Saints, the verdit Innocent,

The Sentence, Come ye bleſſed to my tent.

[[Page 126]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=70)The ſpeare
that pierſt his ſide, the writing Pen,

Chriſtes bloud the Inke, red Inke for Princes name,

The vailes great breach, the miracles for men,

The ſight is ſhew of them that long dead came

From their old graues, reſtor'd to liuing fame.

And that laſt ſignet paſſing all the reſt,

Our ſoules diſcharg'd by Conſumatum est.

Here endleſſe ioy is, there perpetuall cheare,

Their exerciſe, ſweete ſongs of many parts,

Angells the quier, whoſe ſymphonie to heare,

Is able to prouoke conceiuing harts,

To miſconceiue of all inticing arts.

The dirty praiſe, the ſubiect is the Lord,

That tunes their gladſome ſpirit to this accord.

Th. Storer.

What ſo the Heauens in their ſecret doombe,

Ordained haue, how can fraile fleſhly wight

Forecaſt, but it muſt needs to iſſue come.

Ed. Spencer.

What in the heauenly parliament aboue,

Is written by the finger of the firſt,

Mortalls may feele, but neuer can remoue,

For they are ſubiect to the heauens worſt.

I. Markham.

By mortall lawe the bond may be diuorced,

The heauens decrees by no meanes can be forced.

M. Drarton.

In vaine doth man contend againſt the Starres,

For what he ſeekes to make, his wiſedome marres.

S. Daniell.

— Humane wiſhes neuer haue the power

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl.

Experience proues, and daily it is ſeene,

In vaine (too vaine) man ſtriues againſt the heauens.

G. Gaſcoigne.

It is moſt true, that eyes are bound to ſerue

The inward part, and that th'heauenly part

Ought to be King, from whoſe rules who doth ſwerue,

Rebelles to nature, ſtriue for their owne ſmart.

True that true bewtie, vertue is indeed,

Whereof this bewtie can be but a ſhade:

Which elements, with mortall mixture breed,

True that on earth we are but pilgrimes made,

And ſhould in ſoule vp to our countrey moue.

S. Ph. Sydney.

Heauen is our home, we are but ſtraungers here.

M. Drayton.

The heauens, earth, and aire, and ſeas and all,

Taught men to ſee, but not to ſhunne their fall.

S. Daniell.

That which they made, who can them warne to ſpill.

Ed. Spencer.

In vaine be armes, when heauen becomes thy foe.

Idem.

Looke when the heauens are to iuſtice bent,

All things be turn'd to our iuſt puniſhment.

Idem.

[[Page 128]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=71)

All powers are ſubiect to the power of heauen,

Nor wrongs paſſe vnreuenged, although excuſ'd.

Idem.

Would heauen her bewtie ſhould be hid from ſight,

Nere would ſhe thus adorne her ſelfe with light,

With ſparkling Lamps; nor would ſhe paint her throne

But ſhe delighted to be gaz'd vpon.

And when the glorious ſunne goes downe,

Would ſhe put on her ſtary beſtudded crowne,

And in her masking ſure, the ſpangled skie

Come forth to bride it with her reuellry,

Heauens gaue this gift to all things in creation,

That they in this ſhould immitate their faſhion.

Idem. M Drayton.

Heauens influence was neuer conſtant yet,

In good or bad, as to continue it.

Th. Kyd.

If thou be wiſe hold this as ominous,

The heauens not like diſpoſed euery houre,

The ſtarres be ſtill predominant in vs:

Fortune not alway forth her bagge doth powre,

Nor euery cloude doth raine a golden ſhowre.

M. Drayton.

### 1.73. Heart.

Free is the Heart, the temple of the minde,

The ſanctuarie ſacred from aboue,

Where nature keepes the keys that looſe and binde,

No mortall hand force, open can that doore,

So cloſe ſhut vp, and lock to all mankinde.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 129]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=71)

The bodies wound, by medicines may be eaſed,

But griefes of heart, by ſalues are not appeaſed.

R. Greene.

By thought of heart, the ſpeech of tongue is carried.

S. I. Harr. Tran.

—Happineſſe,

vid. Felicitie.

### 1.74. Hate.

Hate is the elder, loue the yonger brother,

Yet is the yonger ſtronger in his ſtate

Then th'elder, and him maſtereth ſtill in all debate.

Ed. Spencer.

Nor Hate nor loue, did euer iudge aright,

Innated hate will hardly be diſplaſte

Out of high hearts, and chiefly where debate

Happeneth amongſt great perſons of eſtate.

I. H. Mirr. of M.

Hatred muſt be beguilde by ſome new courſe,

Where ſtates are ſtrong, & Princes doubt their force.

S. Daniell.

Spight bites the dead, that liuing neuer darde.

Ed. Spencer.

Sildome doth malice want a meane to worke.

M. Drayton.

Hate hits the hie, and windes force talleſt towers▪

Hate is peculiar to a Princes ſtate.

R. Greene.

Hatred accompanies proſperitie,

For one man greeueth at an others good:

And ſo much more we thinke o [...]r miſerie,

The more that fortune hath with others ſtood.

[[Page 132]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=72)So that we
ſeld are ſeene as wiſedome would,

To bridle time with reaſon as we ſhould.

Th. Kyd.

### 1.75. Haſte.

Oft times the greateſt haſte the worſer ſpeeds.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

As buſie braines muſt beat on tickle toyes,

As raſh inuention breeds a raw deuice:

So ſuddein falles do hinder haſtie ioyes,

And as ſwift baits do fleeteſt fiſh intice,

So haſte makes waſte, and therefore now I ſay,

No haſte but good, where wiſedome beares the ſway.

G. Gaſcoigne.

The ſwifteſt bitch brings forth the blindeſt whelpes,

The hotteſt feuers coldeſt crampes enſue.

The nakedſt need, hath ouer-lateſt helpes.

Idem.

Haſtie reſpect, repents when tis too late.

I. Markeham.

Raſhneſſe ſees all, but nothing can preuent.

M. Drayton.

Fore-iudging, puts out one of wiſedomes eies.

—If by raſhneſſe valour haue got honour,

We blame the raſhneſſe, but reward the valour.

Ch. Fitz Ieffrey.

O raſh falſe heat wrapt in repentance cold,

Thy haſte ſprings ſtill blood, and nere growes old.

W. Sh.

[[Page 133]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=72)

### 1.76. Hell.

An hidious hole all vaſt withouten ſhape,

Of endleſſe depth, orewhelm'd with ragged ſtone:

With ougly mouth and grifly iawes doth gape,

And to our ſight confounds it ſelfe in one.

Here entred we, and yeeding forth anon

An horrible loathly lake we might diſcerne

As blacke as pitch, that cleped is Auerne,

A deadly gulfe, where nought but rubbiſh growes,

With foule blacke ſwelth in thickned lumps that lies:

Which vp in th'aire ſuch ſtinking vapour throwes.

That ouer, there may fly no fowle but dies,

Choakt with th'peſtilent ſauours that ariſe.

M. Sackuile.

Thence come we to the horror and the hell,

The large great kingdomes and the dreadfull raigne,

Of Pluto in his throne where he did dwell,

The wide waſte places and the hugie plaine:

The waylings, ſhrikes, and ſundry ſorts of paine.

The ſighes, the ſobbes, the deep and deadly grone,

Earth, aire, and all reſounding plaine and mone.

Idem.

Then turning backe, in ſilence ſoft they ſtole,

And brought the heauy courſe with eaſie pace,

To yawning gulfe of deep Auernus hole,

And by that ſame an entrance darke and baſe,

With ſmoake and Sulphur hiding all the place,

Deſcends to hell, their creature neuer paſt,

That back returned without heauenly grace.

But dreadfull furies, which their chaines haue braſt,

And damned ſprights, ſent forth to make ill men agaſt.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 132]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=73)

—Darkſome den of Auernus

Wher's no path to returne, nor ſtarting holes to be ſcaping,

Deſteny, death, and hell, and howling hidious hell-hound,

Loathſom ſtreames of Stix, that nine times compaſſe Auer­nu [...].

Ab. Fraunce.

They paſſe the bitter waues of Acheron,

Where many ſoules ſit wayling wofully:

And come to fiery flood of Phlegeton,

Whereas the damned ghoaſts in torments fry,

And with ſharpe ſhrilling ſhrikes do bootleſſe cry:

Curſing high Ioue, the which them thither ſent.

Ed. Spencer.

About the deſart parts of Greece there is a vally low,

To which the roaring waters fall, that frō the moūtains flow [...]

So rocks do ouerſhadow it, that ſcarſe a man may vew

The open aire, no ſun ſhines there; amidſt this darkeſom cre [...]

Doth ſtand a citie, to the ſame belongs one onely gate,

But one at once may come therto, the entrance is ſo ſtrait.

Cut out the rough maine ſtony rocke: this citie did belong

To Pluto, and becauſe that he was doing alwaies wrong,

And kept a theeuiſh rable that in miſchiefe did excell,

His citizens were diuels ſaid, and citie named hell.

W. Warner.

### 1.77. Honour.

In woods, in waues, in warres doth honour dwell,

And will be found with petill and with paine:

Ne can the man that moulds in idle cell

Vnto her happie manſion attaine,

Before her gate hie God did ſweat ordaine,

And wakefull watches euer to abide.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 133]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=73)

Honour is purchaſ'de by the deeds we doo.

Ch. Marlowe.

—Honour is not wonne

Vntill ſome honourable deed be donne.

Idem.

Danger bids ſeeke the ſofteſt way one way.

But what ſaith honour? honour ſaith not ſo.

Neuer retire with ſhame; this honour ſaith:

The worſt that can befall one, is but death.

S. I. Harr.

In braue purſuit of honourable deed,

There is I know not what great difference

Betweene the vulgar and the common ſeed,

Which vnto things of valerous pretence

Seemes to be borne by natiue influence:

As feates of armes, and loue to entertaine,

But chiefly skill to ride, doth ſeeme a ſcience,

Proper to gentle blood; ſome others faine.

To manage ſteed. &c.

Ed. Spencer.

—Euer great imployment for the great,

Quickens the bloud, and honour doth beget.

S. Daniell.

—Promotion is a puffe,

Theſe worldly honors are but ſhades of ſweete:

Who ſeeke too much before they get enough,

Before they meet the meane, with death they meete.

With death they meete the hauen of all deſire,

Where will muſt wa [...]ne, and pride cannot aſpire.

D. Lodge.

Honour a thing without vs, not our owne.

S. D.

[[Page 134]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=74)

What doth auaile to haue a princely place,

A name of honour, and an high degree:

To come by kindred of a noble race,

Except we princely worthy noble bee,

The fruite declares the goodneſſe of the tree.

Do brag no more of birth or linage than,

Sith vertue, grace, and manners make the man.

M. of M.

Search all thy bookes, and thou ſhalt finde therein,

That honour is more hard to hold then win.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Defeated honour neuer more is to be got againe.

W. Warner.

—Vile is honour, and a little vaine,

The which true worth and danger do not gaine.

S. Daniell.

Vertue can beare what can on vertue fall.

Who cheapneth honour muſt not ſtand on price.

M. Drayton.

It moſt behoues the honourable race

Of mightie peeres, true wiſedome to ſuſtaine:

And with their noble countenance to grace

The learned forheads without gifts or gaine.

Or rather learnd themſelues behoues to bee,

That is the garland of nobilitie.

Ed. Spencer.

—If that honour haue one minutes ſtaine,

An hundred yeares ſcant can it cleanſe againe.

S. I. H. Tranſl.

A ſhame to fetch our long diſcent from kings,

[[Page 135]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=74)And from
great Ioue deriue our pedigree:

The braue atchiements of an hundred things,

Breathing vaine boaſts the world to terrifie,

If we our ſelues do blot with infamie.

And ſtaine the right and honour that is theirs,

Men cannot leaue their vertues to their heires.

M. Drayton.

Honour is grounded on the tickle yce.

The pureſt lawne moſt apt for euery ſpot.

Idem.

Honors ſhade, thruſts honors ſubſtance from his place.

I. Marſton.

Honour by due right is vertues hire.

Th. Watſon.

Honours without imployment of eſtate,

Are like to ſun-beames without heate or light:

A noble man and not a magiſtrate

Shines halfe eclipſed in his cleareſt bright.

Ioyne heauenly gifts to earthly, light to light.

Let theſe great excellencies make a truce,

Fortune ſhall need no wheele-wright for her vſe.

Th. Storer.

Great is the choiſe that growes in youthfull minde,

When honour falles at variance with affection:

Nor could it yet be knowne or well definde,

Which paſſion keeps the other in ſubiection.

Both do allure, both doth the iudgements blinde,

Both do corrupt the heart with ſtrong infection.

Yet loe ſometimes theſe hurts procure our weale,

Euen as one poyſon doth another heale.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

[[Page 136]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=75)

The fiery ſparkling precious Chryſolite

Spangled with gold, doth moſt tranſplendent ſhine:

The pearle grac'd by the ring, the ring by it,

The one, the others beautie doth refine:

And both together beauties do combine.

The iewell decks the golden haire that weares it,

Honour decks learning, that with honour reares it.

Ch. Fitz.

The inward touch that wounded honour beares,

Reſts cloſely ranckling, and can find no eaſe,

Till death of one ſide cure this great diſeaſe.

S. Daniell.

### 1.78. Hope.

Faiths yonger ſiſter that Speranza hight,

Was clad in blew, that her beſeemed well:

Not all ſo chearfull ſeemed ſhe of ſight

As was her ſiſter: whether dread did dwell

Or anguiſh in her heart, is hard to tell:

Vpon her arme a ſiluer anchor lay,

Whereon ſhe leaned euer as befell.

And euer vp to heauen as ſhe did pray,

Her eyes were bent, ne ſwarued other way.

Ed. Spencer.

—Hope a handſome maide,

Of chearfull looke and louely to behold:

In ſilken Samite ſhe was light araide,

And her faire locks were wouen vp in gold:

She alway ſmilde, and in her hand did hold

An holy water ſprinkle, dipt in dewe,

With which ſhe ſprinkled fauours manifold.

[[Page 137]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=75)On whom ſhe
liſt, and did great liking ſhewe,

Great liking vnto many, but true loue to fewe.

Idem.

True hope is ſwift, and flies with ſwallowes wings,

Kings it makes Gods, and meaner creatures Kings.

W. Shakespeare.

Wan Hope poore ſoule, on broken anchor ſits

Wringing his armes, as robbed of his bliſſe.

D. Lodge.

What better emperor can the body hold,

Then ſacred Hope? the element from whence,

Vertue is drawne freſh looking, neuer old:

Matter moſt worthy of a ſtrong defence.

It animates yoong men, and makes them bold,

Arming their hearts with holy influence,

It like a ſeale in tender thoughts doth preſſe

The perfect Image of all happineſſe.

L. Markham.

— Hope is double, and hath double power,

As being mortall, and immortall fram'de:

In th'one ſhee's moueleſſe, certaine euery houre:

In th'other doubtfull, and incertaine nam'de.

Th'immortall Hope raines in a holy bowre,

In earthy cloſures is the mortall tam'de.

And theſe two contraries, where ere they meete,

Double delight, and make our thoughts more ſweete.

Idem.

He that hopes leaſt, leaues not to hope at all,

But hopes the moſt, hoping ſo little hope,

Augmenting of our hope, makes hope growe ſmall,

And taking from it, giues it greater ſcope.

[[Page 138]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=76)The
deſperate man which in diſpaire doth fall,

Hopes by that end ill fortune to reuoke,

And to this hope belongs a ſecond part,

Which we call confidence, which rules the hart.

This ſecond part of hope, this confidence,

Doth Tully call a vertue that doth guide

The Spirit to an honeſt reſidence,

Without whoſe aide, no pleaſure will abide

In our world-wearied fleſh.

I. Markeham.

All men are gueſts where hope doth hold the feaſt.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Such is the weakeneſſe of all mortall hope,

So tickle is the ſtate of earthly things,

And brings vs bale and bitter ſorrowings,

That ere they come vnto their aimed ſcope,

They fall too ſhort of our fraile reckonings,

In ſtead of comfort which we ſhould embrace.

This is the death of Keyſars and of Kings,

Let none therefore that is in meaner place,

Too greatly grieue at any vnluckie caſe.

Ed. Spencer.

Vnworthy they of grace, whom one deniall

Excludes from faireſt hope, without farther triall.

Idem.

Hope like the Hyenna comming to be old,

Alters his ſhape, is turned to diſpaire.

H. C.

Sorrow doth vtter what vs ſtill doth grieue,

But hope forbids vs ſorrow to beleeue.

Idem.

[[Page 139]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=76)

— Our hopes good deceiues vs,

But that we would forgoe that ſeldome leaues vs.

Idem.

None without great hopes will follow ſuch,

Whoſe power and honour doth not promiſe much.

S. Daniell.

Who nothing hopes, let him diſpaire in nought.

Th. Achelly.

To liue in hope of that they meane to giue,

Is to deceiue our ſelues, and not to liue.

D. Lodge.

Hope loſt, breeds griefe, griefe paine, and paine diſeaſe.

Th. Watſon.

Our haps do turne as chaunces on the die.

Nor let him from his hope remoue,

That vnder him, hath mou'd the ſtarres aboue.

M. Drayton.

Hope and haue, in time a man may gaine any woman.

A. Fraunce.

Hope well, feare not, marke this, be wiſe,

Droupe not, for to diſpaire, is to die twiſe.

Ignoto.

Bad haps are holpe with hap and good beliefe.

S. I. Harrington. Tranſl.

O Hope, how cunning with our cares to gloze?

Griefes breathing poynt, the true man to deſire,

The reſt in ſighes, the very thoughts repoſe,

As thou art milde, oh wert thou not a lier?

Faire ſpeaking flatterie ſubtill ſoothing guile:

Ah Hope, in thee our ſorrowes ſweetly ſmile.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 140]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=77)

### 1.79. Humilitie.

He was an aged ſyre, hoary gray,

With lookes full lowly caſt, and gate full ſlowe,

Wont on a ſtaffe his feeble ſteps to ſtay,

Hight Humilta: they paſſe in ſtouping lowe,

For ſtraight and narrow was the way that he did ſhowe.

Ed. Spencer.

Humilitie to heauen, the ſtep, the ſtaire

Is, for deuotion, ſacrifice, and praier.

M. Drayton.

The bending knee in ſafetie ſtill doth goe,

When others ſtumble, as too ſtiffe to bowe.

Idem.

As on the vnſauourie ſtocke, the Lillie is borne,

And as the Roſe growes on the pricking thorne,

So modeſt life with ſobs of grieuous ſmart,

And cries deuout, comes from an humble hart.

Th. Hudſon. Tranſl,

More honour in Humilitie, then ſafetie in walles,

Proud liuers proue not monuments, ſaue onely in their falles.

VV. Warner.

Ah God ſhield man that I ſhould clime,

and learne to looke aloft:

This reed is ripe, that oftentime:

great climers fall vnſoft.

In humble dale is footing faſt,

the trode is not ſo fickle:

And though one fall through heedleſſe haſte,

yet is his miſſe not mickle.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 141]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=77)

The lowly heart doth win the loue of all,

But pride at laſt, is ſure of ſhamefull fall.

G. Tur.

### 1.80. Hypocriſie.

— Hypocriſie hath bred of Godlike diuels ſtore,

That ſpeake to ſerue, that ſerue to ſhift, that ſhift to ſpare by guile,

And ſmoothe and ſoothe, and yet deceiue, with ſcriptum est meane while.

W. Warner.

But let thē heaue their hāds to heauē, they ſhow they'r here in hell,

That ſeeme deuout to cloake deceit, and ſay, but do not well.

Idem.

Who cloakes their mindes in hoods of holineſſe

Are double villaines, and the Hypocrite

Is moſt odious in Gods glorious ſight,

That takes his name to couer wickedneſſe.

I. Syl.

Many vſe temples to ſet godly faces

On impious hearts; thoſe ſinnes vſe moſt exceſſe,

That ſeeke their ſhrowdes in fained holineſſe.

G. Chapman.

Ʋide. Diſſimulation.

### 1.81. Iealouſie.

Shee ſeem'd of womans ſhape, but in her head

A thouſand eyes ſhe had that watch did keepe:

As many eares with which ſhe harkened,

Her eyes want lids, and therefore neuer ſleepe.

In ſtead of haire, her crowne ſnakes ouerſpred.

Thus marched ſhe forth of the darknes deepe,

Her tayle one ſerpent bigger then the reſt,

Which ſhe with knots faſtened about her breſt.

S. I. Harrington. Tranſl.

A monſter, others harme, ſelfe miſerie

Bewties plague, vertues ſcourge, ſuccour of lies.

[[Page 142]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=78)Who ſince
he hath by natures ſpeciall grace,

So piercing pawes as ſpoile, when they embrace,

So nimble feete, as ſtirre though ſtill on thornes.

So many men ſeeking their owne woe.

So ample eares that neuer good newes kowes

Is it not ill that ſuch a beaſt want hotnes?

S. Ph. Sydney.

O hatefull helliſh ſnake what furie firſt

Broughr thee from balefull houſe of Proſerpine?

Where in her boſome ſhe the long had nurſt,

And foſtered vp with bitter milke of time,

Foule iealouſie that turneſt loue diuine.

To day leſſe dread, and mak'ſt the liuing hart

With hatefull thoughts to languiſh and to pine,

And feed it ſelfe with ſelfe conſuming ſmart,

Of all the paſſions in the minde, thou viler art.

Ed. Spencer.

O Iealouſie, daughter of Enuie and loue,

Moſt wayward iſſue of a gentle ſire

Foſtred with feares thy fathers ioies to proue,

Mirth marring monſter, borne in ſubtiltie,

Hatefull vnto thy ſelfe, flying thy owne deſire,

Feeding vpon ſuſpect that doth renew thee,

Happie were Louers, if they neuer knew thee.

Thou haſt a thouſand gates thou entreſt by,

Condemning trembling paſſions to our hart.

Hundred eyed Argus, euer making ſpy,

Pale hagge, infernall furie, pleaſures ſmart:

Enuious obſeruer, prying in euery part,

Suſpitions fearefull, gazing ſtill about the hart.

[[Page 143]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=78)O would to
God that loue could be without thee.

S. Daniell.

A new diſeaſe? I know not, new, or old;

But it may well be term'd, poore mortall plaine.

For like the peſtilence, it doth infect

The houſes of the braine: firſt it begins

Solely to worke vpon the phantaſie,

Filling her ſeat with ſuch peſtiferous aire,

As ſoone corrupts the iudgement, and from thence

Sends like contagion to the memorie,

Still each of other taking like infection,

Which as a ſearching vapour ſpreads it ſelfe,

Confuſedly through euery ſenſiue part,

Till not a thought or motion in the minde,

Be farre from the blacke poyſon of ſuſpect.

B. Iohnſon.

Where loue doth raigne, diſturbing iealouſie,

Doth call himſelfe affections Centinell,

And in a peacefull houre, dooth crye kill, kill,

Diſtempering gentle loue with his deſire,

As ayre and water dooth abate the fire:

This ſound informer, this bare-breeding ſpie,

This cancker that eates vp this tender ſpring,

This carry-tale, diſcentio's iealouſie.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Fowle weatherd iealouſie to a forward ſpring,

Makes weeds growe ranke, but ſpoiles a better thing.

Sowes tares gainſt harueſt in the fields of loue,

And dogged humor dogdayes like doth prooue,

Scorching loues glorious world with glowing tong,

A ſerpent by which loue to death is ſtonge

A foe to waſte his pleaſant ſummer bowers,

[[Page 144]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=79)Ruine his
manſions, and deface his bowers.

E. Guilpin.

Pale Iealouſie childe of inſatiat loue,

Of heartſicke thoughts, which melancholy bred,

A hell tormenting feare, no faith can moue:

By diſcontent with deadly poyſon fed,

With heedleſſe youth and error vainly led.

A mortall plague, a vertue drowing floud,

A helliſh fier, not quenched but with bloud.

M. Drayton.

What ſtate of life more pleaſant can we finde,

Then theſe that true and heartie loue do beare?

Whom that ſweet yoake doth faſt together binde,

That man in Paradice firſt learnd to weare.

Were not ſome ſo tormented in their minde

With that ſame vile ſuſpect that filthy feare,

That torture great, that fooliſh phrenezie,

That raging madnes, called Iealouſie,

For euery other ſower that gets a place

To ſeate it ſelfe amidſt this pleaſant ſweete,

Helpes in the end to giue a greater grace,

And make loues ioies more gracious then they were,

He that abſtaines from ſuſtenance a ſpace,

Shall finde both bread and water reliſh ſweete.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

— Iealouſie is Cupids foode,

For the ſwift ſteed runnes not ſo faſt alone,

As when ſome other ſtriue him to out goe.

Ed. Fairfax. Tranſl.

Loue wakes the iealous eye, leaſt then it moues

The iealous eye, the more it lookes it loues.

S. Ph. Sydney.

[[Page 145]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=79)

—No iealouſie can that preuent,

Whereas two parties once be full content.

Idem.

Impatience changeth ſmoake to flame, but iealouſie to hell.

W. Warner.

On loue, ſaies ſome, waits iealouzie, but iealouſie wants loue

When curiouſly the ouerplus doth idle quarels moue.

Idem.

—Where iealouſie is bred,

Hornes in the mind, are worſe then hornes in the hed.

B. Iohnſon.

That canker-worme, that monſter iealouſie,

Which eates the heart, and feeds vpon the gall,

Turning all loues delight to miſerie,

Through feare of looſing his felicitie.

Ed. Spencer.

Shun iealouſie that hart-breake loue, if cat will go to kinde,

Be ſure that Io hath a meanes, that Argus ſhall be blinde.

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

True loue doth looke with pale ſuſpicious eie,

Take away loue, if you take iealouſie.

M. Drayton.

No beaſt is fierer then a iealous woman.

S. Daniell.

### 1.82. Idleneſſe.

Prides coach was drawne of ſixe vnequall beaſts,

On which her ſixe ſage counſellours did ride:

Taught to obey her beſtiall beheaſts,

With like conditions to their kindes applide.

Of which the firſt that all the reſt did guide,

Was ſluggiſh Idleneſſe, the nurſe of ſinne,

[[Page 146]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=80)Vpon a
ſlothfull Aſſe he choſe to ride,

Arraid in habit black and amis thin,

Like to an holy Monke, the ſeruice to begin.

Ed. Spencer.

—Idleneſſe pure innocence ſubuerts,

Defiles our bodie, and our ſoule peruerts:

Yea ſobereſt men it makes delicious,

To vertue dull, to vice ingenious.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

—Ill humours by exceſſiue eaſe are bred,

And ſloath corrupts and choakes the vitall ſprights,

It kills the memorie, and hurts the ſights.

D. Lodge.

—Drowſie ſloth that counterfeiteth lame

With Snaile like motion meaſu [...]ing the ground:

Hauing her armes in willing fetters bound.

Foule, ſluggiſh drone, barren (but ſinne to breed)

Diſeaſed, begger, ſtaru'd with ſinfull need.

I. Silueſter.

If thou flie Idleneſſe, Cupid hath no might,

His bowe lyeth broken, his torch hath no light.

### 1.83. Ignorance.

At laſt with creeping crooked pace forth came

An old old man, with beard as white as ſnow:

That on a ſtaffe his feeble limbs did frame,

And guide his weary gate both too and fro.

For his eye ſight him failed long ago,

And on his arme a bunch of keyes he bore,

The which vnvſed, ruſt did ouergrow.

[[Page 147]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=80)But very
vncouth ſight was to behold

How he did faſhion his vntoward pace:

For a [...] he forward mou'd his footing old,

So backward ſtill was turnd his wrinckled face [...]

Vnlike to men who euer as they trace

Both feete and face one way are wont to lead,

His name Ignaro, did his nature right aread.

Ed. Spencer.

Image of helliſh horror, Ignorance,

Borne in the boſome of the blacke abiſſe,

And fed with furies milke for ſuſtenance,

Of his weake infancie begot amiſſe:

By gnawing ſloth, vpon his mother night,

So he his ſonnes, both Syre and brother hight.

Idem.

—All is turned into wilderneſſe,

Whileſt Ignorance the Muſes doth oppreſſe.

Idem.

—Hell and darkneſſe and the griſly graue,

Is Ignorance, the enemy of grace:

That minds of men borne heauenly, doth deface.

Idem.

Tis nought but ſhowes that Ignorance eſteemes

The thing poſſeſt, is not the thing it ſeemes.

S. Daniell.

—Great ill vpon deſert doth chance,

When it doth paſſe by beaſtly Ignorance.

M. Dray.

### 1.84. Impatience.

Impatience ehangeth ſmoake to flame, but iealouſie to hell.

W. Warner.

[[Page 148]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=81)

Make not thy griefe too great by thy ſuppoſe,

Let not Impatience aggrauate thy woes.

D. Lodge.

### 1.85. Infamie.

—To attempt hie daungers euident,

Without conſtraint or need is Infamie.

And honour turnes to raſhneſſe in th'euent:

And who ſo dares, not caring how he dares,

Sells vertues name, to purchaſe fooliſh cares.

I. Markham.

—Reproach

A vile diſeaſe that neuer time can cure.

M. Drayton.

Sinne in a chaine leades on her ſiſter ſhame,

And both in giues faſt fettered to defame.

Idem.

Thy name once foild, incurable the blot,

Thy name defaſte whch toucht with any ſtaine,

And once ſupplanted neuer growes againe.

Gainſt open ſhame no text can well be cited,

The blow once giuen cannot be euited.

M. Drayton.

### 1.86. Ingratitude.

Vnthankfulneſſe is that great ſin,

Which made the diuel and his angels fall:

Loſt him and them the ioyes that they were in,

And now in hell detaines them bound and thrall.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

Thou hatefull monſter baſe Ingratitude,

Soules mortall poyſon, deadly killing wound:

[[Page 149]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=81)Deceitfull
ſerpent ſeeking to delude,

Blacke loathſome ditch, where all deſert is drown'd:

Vile peſtilence, which all things doeſt confound.

At firſt created to no other end,

But to greeue thoſe, whom nothing could offend.

M. Drayton.

Ingratefull who is call'd, the worſt of ill is ſpoken.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Tis true that ſlaue whom Pompey did promote,

Was he, that firſt aſſaid to cut his throte.

D. Lodge.

### 1.87. Innocencie.

A plaint of guiltleſſe hurt doth pierce the skie.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Sildome vntoucht doth Innocencie eſcape,

When errour commeth in good counſels ſhape.

A lawfull title, counterchecks proud might,

The weakeſt things, become ſtrong props to right.

M. Drayton.

Pure Innocence ſildome ſuſpecteth ought.

Idem.

A guiltleſſe mind doth eaſily deeme the beſt.

M. of M.

The lyon licks the ſores of filly wounded ſheep,

The dead mās courſe doth cauſe the crocodile to weep:

The waues that waſt the rocks refreſh the rottē weeds,

Such ruth the wrack of innocence in cruel creatures breeds.

M. of M.

Well gaue that Iudge his doome vpon the death

Of Titus Laelius that in bed was ſlaine:

When euery wight the cruell murder laith

[[Page 150]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=82)To his two
ſonnes that in his chamber laie,

That Iudge that by the proofe perceiueth plaine

That they were found faſt ſleeping in their bed,

Hath deem'd them guiltleſſe of this bloudy ſhed.

He thought it could not be that they which brake

The lawes of God and man in ſuch outrage,

Could ſo forth with themſelues to reſt betake:

He rather thought the horror and the rage

Of ſuch an hainous gilt, could neuer ſwage.

Nor neuer ſuffer them to ſleepe or reſt,

Or dreadleſſe breathe one breath out of their breſt.

M. Sackuile.

### 1.88. Inconſtancie.

Vnto the world ſuch is Inconſtancie,

As ſappe to tree, as apple to the eie.

D. Lodge.

### 1.89. Ioye.

All like as ſicker as the end of woe is Ioye,

And glorious light to obſcure night doth tend,

So extreame Ioy in extreame woe doth end.

M. of M.

For why extreames are haps rackt out of courſe,

By violent might far ſwinged forth perforce:

Which as they are piercingſt they violenteſt moue:

For that they are nere to cauſe that doth them ſhoue.

So ſooneſt fall from that their higheſt extreame,

To th'other contrary that doth want of meane,

So laugh'd he erſt that laughed out his breath.

Idem.

The pleaſing meanes bode not the luckieſt ends,

Nor aye, found treaſure to like pleaſure tends.

[[Page 151]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=82)Mirth
meanes not mirth alwaies thrice happie lyne

Of witte to ſhun th'exceſſe that all deſire.

Idem.

Ioy lighteneth woe, woe Ioy doth moderate.

M. Drayton.

Ioy is forgetfull, weale thinkes not of woe.

Idem.

—Ioy aſcends, but ſorrow ſinks below.

Ch. Fitz.

Fruits follow flowers, and ſorrow greateſt Ioyes.

As ſudden griefe, ſo ſudden Ioy doth kill.

Th. Achelly.

The Romane widow died when ſhe beheld

Her ſonne who erſt ſhe counted ſlaine in field.

G. Gaſcoigne.

—Exceſſiue Ioy

Leapeth and likes finding the Appian way

Too ſtrait for her: whoſe ſences all poſſeſſe

All wiſhed pleaſure, in all plenteouſneſſe.

I. Sylueſter.

### 1.90. Iniustice.

Iniuſtice neuer yet tooke laſting roote.

Nor held that long, Impietie did winne.

S. Daniell.

So foule a thing, ô thou Iniuſtice art,

That torment'ſt both the dooer and diſtreſt:

For when a man hath done a wicked part,

O how he ſtriues to excuſe, to make the beſt:

To ſhift the fault t'vnburden his chargde hart.

And glad to find the leaſt ſurmiſe of reſt.

[[Page 152]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=83)And if he
could make his, ſeeme others ſin,

O what repoſe, what eaſe he findes therein.

Idem.

Iniuſtice neuer ſcapes vnpuniſht ſtill,

Though men reuenge not, yet the heauens will.

Idem.

### 1.91. Iustice.

Now when the world with ſin gan to abound,

Aſtraea loathing longer here to ſpace

Mongſt wicked men in whom no truth ſhe found,

Returnd to heauen whence ſhe deriu'd her race,

Where ſhe hath now an euerlaſting place.

Mongſt thoſe twelue ſignes which rightly we do ſee,

The heauens bright ſhining bawdrick to inchace:

And is the virgin ſixt in her degree,

And next her ſelf, her righteous ballance hanging bee.

Ed. Spencer.

Then iuſtice comes the laſt of all the gods,

That left her reſidence here on the earth:

For lacke of whom the world grew all at ods,

And man to man curſes each others birth.

For then vſurping wrong ſucceeded ſtraight,

That no man knew how long to hold his right:

Then calls the world for Iuſtice back againe,

Complaining how they now were ouerrunne,

And they would ſuffer any ſcourging paine,

In pennance for thoſe ſinnes themſelues had donne.

For that their wickedneſſe did force that power

To leaue the ſeate whereas ſhe ſate before,

Whereas the Gods did in their courts decree,

Iuſtice ſhould be transformed to the ſtarres:

[[Page 153]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=83)There
fooliſh men might euery minute ſee

Her that ſhould helpe theſe miſeries of theirs,

But ſtand like Tantalus within thoſe brinkes,

Where he ſees water, but yet neuer drinkes.

Ch. Middleton.

— Faire Astraea of the Titans line,

Whom equitie and iuſtice made diuine.

M. Drayton.

—Well did the Anticke world inuent,

That Iuſtice was a God of ſoueraigne grace,

And Altars vnto him and temples lent,

And heauenly honours in the higheſt place.

Calling him, great Oſyris of the race,

Of th'old Aegyptian Kings, that whilome were,

With fained colours ſhading a true caſe:

For that Oſyris whil'ſt he liued here,

The iuſteſt man aliue and trueſt did aſpire.

His wife was Iſis, whom they likewiſe made

A goddeſſe of great power and ſoueraigntie:

And in her perſon cunningly did ſhade,

That part of Iuſtice which is equitie.

Ed. Spencer.

Vntill the world ftom his perfection fell,

Into all filth and foule iniquitie:

Astraea here mongſt earthly men did dwell,

And in the rules of iuſtice then and ſtumbled well.

Idem.

Where Iuſtice growes, there growes eke quiet grace,

The which doth quench the brand of helliſh ſmart,

And that accurſt hand-writing doth deface.

Idem.

[[Page 154]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=84)

—Sparing Iuſtice, feeds iniquitie.

W. Shakespeare.

The firſt was Bacchus, that with furious might,

All th'eaſt before vntam'de did ouerrunne,

And wrong repreſſed and eſtabliſht right,

Which lawleſſe men had formerly foredone,

Their iuſtice forc't her princely rule begunne.

Next Hercules, his like enſample ſhewed,

Who all the weſt with equall conqueſt wonne.

And monſtrous Tirants with his club ſubdued,

The club of Iuſtice dread, with kingly power endued.

Ed. Spencer.

Who ſo vpon himſelfe will take the skill,

And Iuſtice vnto people to deuide,

Had need of mightie hands for to fulfill

That which he doth, with righteous doome decide,

And for to maiſter wrong and puiſſant pride:

For vaine it is to deeme of things aright,

And make wrong doers Iuſtice to deride

Vnleſſe it be perform'd with dreadleſſe might,

For power is the right-hand of iuſtice truly hight.

Idem.

Offences vrg'd in publike, are made worſe,

The ſhew of Iuſtice aggrauates deſpight:

The multitude that looke not to the cauſe,

Reſt ſatſfied, ſo it be done by lawes.

S. Daniel.

It often falles in courſe of common life,

That right long time is ouerborne of wrong,

Through auarice or power, or guile, or ſtrife,

That weakens her, and makes her partie ſtrong,

[[Page 155]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=84)But Iuſtice
though her doome ſhe do prolong.

Yet at the laſt ſhe will her owne cauſe right.

Fd. Spencer.

Good cauſes need not curious termes, & equall Iudges heare

The equitie, not eloquence.

W. Warner.

Who paſſeth iudgement for his priuate gaine,

He well may iudge he is adiudg'd to paine.

R. Greene.

### 1.92. Kings.

Kings are the Gods vicegerents on the earth,

The Gods haue power, Kings from that power haue might:

Kings ſhould excell in vertue and in birth:

Gods puniſh wrongs, & kings ſhould maintaine right,

They be the ſunnes from which we borrow light,

And they as Kings, ſhould ſtill in iuſtice ſtriue

With Gods, from whom their beings they deriue.

M. Drayton.

The baſer is he comming from a King,

To ſhame his hopes with deeds degenerate:

The mightier man, the mightier is the thing,

That makes him honoured, or begets him hate:

For greater ſcandall waits on greater ſtate.

The Moone being clouded, preſently is miſt,

But litle ſtarres may hide them where they liſt.

The Crowe may bathe his cole-blacke wing in mire,

And vnperceiu'd, flie with the filth away,

But if ſhe like the ſnow white ſwan deſire,

The ſtaine vpon his ſiluer downe will ſtay,

Poore groomes are ſightles nights, kings glorious day.

[[Page 156]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=85)Gnats are
vnnoted whereſoeuer they flie,

But Eagles are gaz'd vpon with euery eie.

Ʋ Ʋ. Shakeſpeare.

— Since the heauens ſtrong arms teach Kings, to ſtād,

Angells are plac't about the glorious throne,

To gard it from the ſtroakes of traitrous hand.

Th. Dekkar.

When thou becom'ſt an earthly God, mens faults to ouerſee,

Forget not that eternall God, that ouerlooketh thee.

W. Warner.

The leaſt part of a King is allowing him, and none

Leſſe priuate then a Prince, the weale or woe of euery one.

Idem.

He and his people make but one, a body, weake or ſtrong,

As doth the head, the limbs, or limbs the head aſſiſt, or wrōg.

Idem.

Kings, Lords of times and of occaſions,

May take th'aduantage when and how they liſt.

S. Daniell.

Kings will be alone, Competitors muſt downe,

Neare death he ſtands, that ſtands to weare a crowne.

Idem.

— It is a daungerous thing

In rule of loue, but once to croſſe a King.

M. Drayton.

Endles cares concur with crowns, a bitter ſweeting is raign.

W. Ʋ Ʋarner.

Not all the water in the rough rude ſea

Can waſh the balme from an anoynted King:

The breath of worldly men cannot depoſe

The deputie elected by the Lord.

W. Shakeſpeare.

[[Page 157]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=85)

He knowes not what it is to be a King,

That thinkes a Scepter is a pleaſant thing.

R. Greene.

A glittering Crowne doth make the haire ſoone gray,

Within whoſe circle, a king is but arreſted,

In all his feaſts hee's but with ſorrow feaſted,

And when his feete diſdaine to touch the mold,

His head's a priſoner in a Iaile of Gold.

M. Drayton.

Vnhappy Kings that neuer can be taught,

To know themſelues, or to diſcerne their fault.

S. Daniell.

— No outragious thing

From vaſſall actors can be wipte away,

The Kings miſdeeds can not be hid in clay.

W. Shakeſpeare.

No Scepter ſerues diſhonour to excuſe,

Nor kingly vaile can couer villainie.

Fame is not ſubiect to authoritie.

M. Drayton.

—Thinke not but Kings are men, and as the reſt miſcarry,

Saue that their fame and infamy continually doth tarry.

Ʋ Ʋ. VVarner.

Kings want no meanes to accompliſh what they will,

M. Drayton.

Miſlikes are ſilly lets where Kings reſolue them,

Where counſell chaſing will hath emperie,

Deeds are too preſt for reaſon to diſſolue them,

In mightie mindes a grounded vanitie.

Like ſprings that ceaſſeſſe neuer ſtoppeth,

Vntill her neighbour Oake ſhe ouertoppeth.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 158]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=86)

—Great men too well grac'd, much rigor vſe,

Preſuming fauorites miſchiefe euer bring:

So that concluding, I may boldly ſpeake,

Minions too great, argue a king too weake.

S. Daniell.

New kings do feare when old kings farther ſtraine,

Eſtabliſht ſtate to all things will conſent.

Idem.

—Good from kings muſt not be drawne by force.

Idem.

A Scepter like a pillar of great height,

Whereon a mightie building doth depend:

Which when the ſame is ouer-preſt with waight,

And paſt his compaſſe forc't thereby to bend.

His maſſie roofe downe to the ground doth ſend.

Cruſhing the leſſer part, and murthering all

Which ſtand within the compaſſe of his fall.

M. Drayton.

Too true that tyrant Dyoniſyus

Did picture out the image of a king:

When Damocles was placed in his throne,

And ore his head a threatning ſword did hang,

Faſtened vp only by a horſes haire.

R. Greene.

### 1.93. Kingdomes.

A rule there is, not failing but moſt ſure,

Kingdome no kin doth know,  [...]e can endure.

M. of M.

Thebes, Babell, Rome, theſe proud heauē daring wonders

Loe vnder ground in duſt and aſhes lie,

[[Page 159]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=86)For earthly
kingdomes, euen as men do die.

I. Sylueſter. Tranſl.

If thou wilt mightie be, flie from the rage

Or cruell will, and ſee thou keep thee free

From the fowle yoake of ſenſuall bondage:

For though thy Empire ſtretcheth to Indian ſea,

And for thy feare trembleth the fartheſt Thiſce,

If thy deſire haue ouer thee the power,

Subiect then art thou, and no gouernour.

E. of Surrey.

### 1.94. Knowledge.

Through knowledge we behold the worlds creation,

How in his cradle firſt he foſtered was:

And iudge of natures cunning operation,

How things ſhe formed of a formeleſſe maſſe.

By knowledge we do learne our ſelues to knowe,

And what to man, and what to God we owe:

From hence we mount aloft vnto the skie,

And looke into the chriſtall firmament:

There we behold the heauens great Hierarchie.

The ſtarres pure light, the ſpheares ſwift mouement,

The ſpirits and intelligences faire:

And Angels waiting on th'almighties chaire.

And there with humble mind and hie in ſight,

Th'eternall makers maieſtie we viewe,

His loue, his faith, his glory and his might,

And mercy more then mortall men can viewe.

Ed. Spencer.

Soule of the world, knowledge withouten thee,

What hath the earth that's truly glorious.

[[Page 160]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=87)Why ſhould
our pride make ſuch a ſtirre to bee,

To be forgot? What good is like to this?

To do worthy the writing, and to write,

Worthy the reading, and the worlds delight.

S. Daniell.

What difference twixt man and beaſt is left,

When th'heauenly light of knowledge is put out,

And the ornaments of wiſedome are bereft?

Then wandreth he in errour and in doubt,

Vnweeting of the daunger he is in,

Through fleſhleſſe frailtie, and deceit of ſin.

Ed. Spencer.

— Our new knowledge hath for tedious traine,

A drouping life, an ouerracked braine:

A face forlorne, a ſad and ſullen faſhion,

A reſtleſſe toyle, and cares ſelfepining paſſion.

Knowledge was then euen the ſoules ſoule for light,

The ſpirits calme port, and lanthorne ſhining bright.

To thait-ſtept feet cleare knowledge: not confuſde,

Not ſower but ſweete, not gotten, but infuſde.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

— We ſee to know, men ſtill are glad,

And yet we ſee knowledge oft makes men mad.

S. I. H. Tranſl.

Who ſo knowes moſt, the more he knowes to doubt,

The beſt diſcourſe, is commonly moſt ſtout.

S. Daniell.

— Common is rhe proofe

That enuying is not cunning if it ſtandeth not aloofe.

VV. Warner.

By knowledge thine, thou haſt no name,

Leaſt others know, thou know'ſt the ſame.

[[Page 161]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=87)Skill comes
too ſlow, and life ſo faſt doth flie.

We learne ſo little, and forget ſo much.

I. Dauies.

Vid. Learning.

### 1.95. Labour.

Where eaſe abounds, it's death to do amiſſe,

But who his limbs with labours, and his minde

Behaues with cares, cannot ſo eaſie miſſe:

Abroad in armes, at home in ſtudious kinde,

Who ſeekes with painfull toyle, ſhall honor ſooneſt finde.

Ed. Spencer.

Learne with the Ant in ſommer to prouide,

Driue with the Bee the drone from out the hiue,

Build like the Swallow in the ſommer tide.

D. Lodge.

Much labor is too litle, that ſhould houſhold charge defraye.

W. Warner.

—Induſtry well cheriſht to his face,

In ſun-ſhine walkes in ſpight of ſower diſgrace.

M. Roydon.

The nobleſt borne dame ſhould induſtrious bee,

That which doth good, diſgraceth no degree.

G. Chapman.

Let Mandeuile example be to men not to be idle

In amorous paſſions: labour is to loue at leaſt a bridle▪

VV. Warner.

Adams labour in Eden.

—Edens earth was then ſo fertill and ſo fat,

That he made only ſweet aſſaies in that.

Of skilfull induſtry and naked wrought,

More for delight, then for the gaine he ſought.

[[Page 162]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=88)In briefe,
it was a pleaſant exerciſe,

A labour likte, a paine much like the guiſe

Of cunning dauncers, who although they skip

Run, caper, vault, trauerſe and turne and trip,

From morne til euen, at night againe full merry

Renew their daunce, of dauncing neuer weary:

Or els of hunters, that with happie lucke,

Rowſing betimes ſome often breathed bucke

Or goodly ſtagge, their yelping hounds vncouple,

Wind loud their horns, their hoopes & hallows double

Spurre on and ſpare not, following their deſire:

Themſelues vnweary, though their hacknies tire.

But for in th'end of all their iollitie

Their's found much ſtifneſſe, ſweat and vanitie;

I rather match it to the pleaſing paine

Of Angels pure, who euer ſloth diſdaine.

Or to the Suns calme courſe, who plainleſſe aye

About the welkin poaſteth night and day.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

### 1.96. Learning.

O bleſſed letters that combine in one

All ages paſt, and make one liue withall:

By you we do conferre, with who are gone,

And the dead liuing vnto counſaile call.

By you the vnborne ſhall haue communion

Of what we fe [...]le, and what doth beſt befall.

S. Daniell.

By the cleare beames of learnings light,

We tread the obſcure pathes of Sages right.

Idem.

—But that learning in deſpight of fate

[[Page 163]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=88)Will mount
aloft and enter heauen gate:

And to the ſeat of Ioue it ſelfe aduance,

Hermes had ſlept in hell with ignorance.

Yet as a puniſhment they added this,

That he and pouertie ſhould alwaies kis.

And to this day is euery ſcholler poore,

Groſſe gold from them runnes headlong to the boore.

Ch. Marlowe.

Of little worth is learnings worthy skill,

Where Pilots wiſedome is not perfect ſtill.

Corinnaes praiſe, and Sapphoes are diſcerned

Aboue the reſt, becauſe they both were learned.

S. I. Harr. Tranſl.

K. Cecrops and his royall ſeed did honor Athence ſo,

As that from thence are ſaid the ſprings of ſciences to flow.

W. Warner.

### 1.97. Lechery.

Next vnto him rode luſtfull Lechery

Vpon a bearded Goat, whoſe rugged haire

And whally eyes (the ſigne of iealouſie)

Was like the perſons ſelfe whom he did beare,

Who rough and blacke and filthy did appeare:

Vnſeemly man to pleaſe faire Ladies eie,

Yet he of Ladies oft was loued deare,

When fairer faces were bid ſtanden by,

O who doth know the bent of womens fantaſie?

Ed. Spencer.

Incontinence, dull ſleepe, and idle bed,

All vertue from the world haue baniſhed.

[[Page 164]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=89)The
tickling flames which our fond ſoules ſurprize,

(That dead a while in Epilepſie lies)

Doth ſtarke our ſinewes all by little and little,

Drawing our reaſon in fowle pleaſure brittle.

I. Syl. Tranſl.

Loue comforteth like ſun-ſhine after raine,

But luſts effect, is tempeſt after ſunne:

Loues gentle ſpring doth alwaies freſh remaine,

Luſts winter comes ere ſommer halfe be donne.

Loue ſurfets not, but like a glutton dies,

Loue is all truth, luſt full of forced lies.

W. Shakespeare.

Where whoredome raignes, there murder follows faſt,

As falling leaues before the winters blaſt.

R. Greene.

Luſt is a fire, and for an houre or twaine▪

Giueth a ſcorching blaze, and then he dies.

H. C.

O deeper ſinne then bottomleſſe conceit

Can comprehend in ſtill imagination:

Drunken deſire muſt vomit his receit,

Ere he can ſee his owne abhomination:

While luſt is in his pride, no exclamation

Can cure his heate, or raigne his raſh deſire,

Till like a Iade, ſelfe-will himſelfe do tire.

VV. Shakeſpeare.

Luſt neuer taketh ioy in what is due,

But leaues knowne delights to ſeeke out new.

S. Daniell.

In chaſtitie is euer proſtitute,

Whoſe trees we loath when we haue pluckt the fruite.

G. Chapman.

Eſchue vile Venus toyes, ſhe cuts off age,

And learne this leſſon of (and teach thy friend)

By pocks, death ſudden, begging, harlots end.

M. of M.

The lechars toong is neuer voyd of guile,

Nor Crocodile wants teares to win his praie:

The ſubtilleſt temptor hath the ſweeteſt ſtile,

With rareſt muſicke, Syrens ſoon'ſt betraie.

M. Drayton.

Luſt puts the moſt vnlawfull things in vre,

Nor yet in limits euer could be bounded,

Till he himſelfe himſelfe hath quite confounded.

Idem.

Abandon luſt, if not for ſin, yet to auoyd the ſhame,

So hogs of Ithacus his men the Latian witch did frame.

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

That great Phiſition that had liu'd in helth & age admirde,

Did anſwer askt the cauſe, not he had done, as fleſh deſirde.

Idem.

The Spartans war for rapted queene to Ilions ouerthrow,

The Monarch of Aſſiria chang'd, and Latine kings alſo,

For Tarquins luſt.

Idem.

Each houſe for luſt a harbor and an Inne,

Each citie is a ſanctuary for ſinne.

And all do pitie beautie in diſtreſſe,

If beautie chaſte, then onely pittileſſe.

M. Drayton.

### 1.98. Lawes.

Deriue thy lawes from wiſeſt heads, to be vpholden ſtill,

Not adding or abſtracting, as conceited tire brains will.

[[Page 166]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=90) Encourage
good men by thy loue, reforme the bad by lawe,

Reſerue an eare for either plea, and borrow leaue of awe.

Ʋ Ʋ. VVarner.

In vaine be counſells ſtatutes, humaine lawes,

When chiefe of Councells pleades the iuſteſt cauſe.

M. Drayton.

So conſtantly the Iudges conſter lawes,

That all agree ſtill with the ſtronger cauſe.

M. of M.

Panſamias and Liſander, by their ſwords

And warlike vertues made Lacaena rich,

Fame followed them where they the tents did pitch,

But graue Licurgus by his lawes and words,

Did merit more then theſe renowned Lords.

D. Lodge.

Licurgus for good lawes, loſt his owne libertie,

And thought it better to prefer common commoditie.

G. Gaſcoigne.

That Lawyer thogh he more by art thē right doth ouerthrow

Conſents to ſin, deceiues the Iudge, wrōg right is iustice foe.

Ʋ Ʋ. VVarner.

### 1.99. Libertie.

Sweete libertie to vs giues leaue to ſing,

What world it was where loue the rule did beare,

How fooliſh chaunce by lots rul'd euery thing,

How errour was maine ſaile, each waue a teare.

The Mr. loue himſelfe; deepe ſighes weare winde,

Cares rowd with vowes, the ſhip vnmerry minde.

Falſe hope as firme oft turn'd the boate about,

In conſtant faith ſtood vp for middle maſt,

[[Page 167]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=90)Diſpaire
the cable, twiſted all with doubt,

Held griping griefe the piked Anchor faſt,

Bewtie was all the rockes.

VV. Watſon.

O liberty how much is that man bleſt,

Whoſe happie fortunes do his fa [...]es areede,

That for deſerts reioyces to be freede?

Th. Storer.

Sweete libertie the lifes beſt liuing flame.

I. Markham.

Our lands may come againe, but libertie once loſt,

Can neuer find ſuch recōpence as counteruails the coſt.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Learne freedome and felicitie, haukes flying where they list,

Be kindlier & more ſound then haukes beſt tended to the  [...]iſt.

vv. vvarner.

He liues to die a noble death, that life forefreed once ſpends.

Idem.

—The name of Libertie,

The watchword of rebellion euer vſde,

The idle Eccho of vncertaintie

That euermore the ſimple hath abuſde.

S. Daniell.

### 1.100. Life.

— All mans life me ſeemes a Tragedie,

Full of ſad ſighes and ſore Catastrophes,

Firſt comming to the world with weeping eie,

Where all his dayes like dolorous Trophies,

Are heapt with ſpoyles of fortune and of feare.

And he at laſt laid forth on balefull beare.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 168]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=91)

Our life is but a ſtep in duſtie way.

S. Phil. Sidney.

This mortall life as death is tride,

And death giues life.

M. Roydon.

What in this life we haue or can deſire,

Hath time of grow'th and moment of retire.

D. Lodge.

Our bodies, euery foot-ſtep that they make,

March toward death, vntill at laſt they die:

Whether we worke or play, or ſleep or wake,

Our life doth paſſe, and with times wings doth flie.

I. Dauies.

The life of man a warfare right, in body and in ſoule,

Reſignes his robbed carkaſſe to be rolled in the mould.

W. Warner.

—The terme of life is limited.

Ne may a man prolong or ſhorten it,

The ſouldier may not moue from watchfull ſtid,

Nor leaue his ſtand vntill his captaine bid.

Ed. Spencer.

The longer life I wot the greater ſin,

The greater ſin, the greater puniſhment.

Idem.

Thus paſſeth with the ouerplus of life,

The pleaſant ſpring and flower of mortall life:

The Aprils pompe once ſubiect to decay,

Returnes not in the bud that earſt was rife.

Whileſt mornings weepe, the liuely flower doth boſt,

Then pluck the ſtalke, and let not it be loſt.

D. Lodge.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=91)

The ſunne doth ſet and brings againe the day,

But when our life is gone, we ſleepe for aye.

Th. Ach.

Sunne ſets and riſeth, goes downe and quickly reuiueth,

But mans light once out, eternall darkneſſe abideth.

Ab. Fraunce.

All mortall men muſt from this life be gone,

Of life and death, there are more ſoules then one.

The greateſt and moſt glorious thing on ground,

May often need the helpe of weakeſt hand,

So feeble is mans ſtate, and life vnſound,

That in aſſurance it may neuer ſtand,

Till it diſordered be from earthly band.

Ed. Spencer.

— The reſtleſſe life which men here lead,

May be reſembled to the tender plant:

It ſprings, it ſprouts, as babes in cradle breed,

Flouriſh in May, like youthes that wiſedome want,

In Autumne ripe, and rots leaſt ſtore waxe ſcant.

In winter ſhrinkes and ſhrowdes from euery blaſt,

Like crooked age, when luſtie youth is paſt.

G. Gaſcoigne.

The wicked liuers oftentimes haue wicked ends.

S. I. H.

Life is not loſt ſaid ſhe, for which is bought

Endles renowne, that more then death is to be ſought.

Ed. Spencer.

Better it is for one to liue obſcure,

Then in a publike ſtate to liue vnſure.

D. Lodge.

No life is bleſt that is not grac't with loue.

B. Ihonſon.

[[Page 170]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=92)

They double life that dead things griefe ſuſtaine,

They kill, that feele not their friends liuing paine.

G Chapman.

That life's ill ſpar'd that's ſpar'd to caſt more bloud.

S. Daniell.

### 1.101. Loue.

Of Loue's perfection perfectly to ſpeake,

Or of his nature rightly to define:

Indeed doth farre ſurpaſſe our reaſons reach,

And needs this prieſt t'expreſſe his power diuine:

For long before the world he was yborne,

And bred aboue in Ʋenus boſome deare,

For by his power the world was made of yore,

And all that therein wondrous doth appeare.

Ed. Spencer.

Loue is the Lord of all the world by right,

And rules the creatures by his powerfull ſaw:

All being made the vaſſalls of his might,

Through ſecret ſence, which thereto doth them draw.

Idem.

Vapour eterne in man, in beaſt, in tree,

In plant and flower is loue, (and ſo of might)

For in the world may not contained bee,

Without accord and Loues imperiall right.

Yet wends the foxe in holy hood full oft,

And craft in ſtead of truth, beares creſt aloft.

D. Lodge.

— That true Loue which dauncing did inuent,

Is he that tun'd the worlds whole harmonie,

And link't all men in ſweete ſocietie,

[[Page 171]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=92)He firſt
exaulted from th'earth mingled minde,

That heauenly fier or quinteſſence diuine,

Which doth ſuch ſympathy in bewtie finde.

As is betwixt the Elme and fruitfull Vine,

And ſo to beautie euer doth encline.

Lifes life it is, and cordiall to the hart,

And of our better part, the better part.

I. Dauies.

Sweete loue is a celeſtiall harmonie,

Of likely hearts compos'd of hearts conſent,

Which ioy together in ſweete ſympathie,

To worke each others kind and true content,

Which they haue harboured ſince their firſt diſcent,

Out of theſe heauenly bowers, where they do ſee

And know each other here belou'd to bee.

Ed. Spencer.

Iron with wearing ſhines, ruſt waſteth treaſure

On earth, but Loue there is no other pleaſure.

H. Constable.

Loue a continuall fornace doth maintaine.

Idem.

Wealth maiſter is, and porter of the gate,

That lets in loue, when want ſhall come too late.

Th. Churchyard.

—Loue to heauen is fled,

Since ſwearing luſt on earth vſurpt his name,

Vnder whoſe ſimple ſemblance he hath fled

Vpon freſh bewtie blotting it with blame,

Which the hot tyrant ſtaines, and ſoone ber [...]aues,

As caterpillers, do the tender leaues.

W. Sh.

[[Page 172]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=93)

Loue is a ſpirit all compact of fier,

Not groſſe to ſinke, but light and will aſpire.

Idem.

Loue is a golden bubble full of dreames,

That waking breakes, and fills vs with extreames.

G. Chapman.

Loue is a diſcord and a ſtrange diuorce,

Betwixt our ſence and reſt, by whoſe power,

As mad with reaſon, we admit that force,

Which wit or labour neuer may diuorce.

It is a will that brooketh no conſent,

It would refuſe, yet neuer may repent.

— Loue's a deſire, which for to waight a time,

Doth looſe an age of yeares, and ſo doth paſſe,

As doth the ſhadow ſeuerd from his prime,

Seeming as though it were, yet neuer was.

Leauing behind, nought but repentant thoughts,

Of dayes ill ſpent, of that which profits noughts.

It's now a peace, and then a ſudden warre,

A hope conſumde before it is conceiu'd,

At hand it feares, and menaceth a farre,

And he that gaines, is moſt of all deceiu'd.

Loue whets the dulleſt wits his plagues be ſuch,

But makes the wiſe by pleaſing, dote as much.

E. O.

Loue is a brain-ſicke boy, and fierce by kind,

A wilfull thought, which reaſon cannot moue,

A flattering Sycophant, a murdering theefe,

A poyſoned choaking baite, a ticing greefe.

A Tyrant in his lawes, in ſpeech vnknowne,

A blindfold guide, a feather in the winde:

[[Page 173]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=93)A right
Chamelion for change of hew,

A lame-lime-luſt, a tempeſt of the minde.

A breach of charitie, all vertues foe,

A priuate warre, a toilſome web of woe.

A fearefull iealouſie, a vaine deſire,

A labyrinth, a pleaſing miſerie,

A ſhipwracke of mans life, a ſmoakeleſſe fier,

A ſhip of teares, a laſting lunacie.

A heauie ſeruitude, a dropſie thirſt,

A helliſh Iaile, whoſe captiues are accurſt.

Th. Watſon.

A ſugred harme, a poyſon full of pleaſure,

A painted ſhrine, ful-fill'd with rotten treaſure.

An heauen in ſhew, a hell to them that proue,

A broken ſtaffe, which fully doth vphold,

A flower, that fades with euery froſtie cold:

An Orient roſe, ſprung from a withered plant,

A game in ſeeming, ſhadowed ſtill with want.

A minutes ioy to gaine a world of griefe,

A ſubtill net, to ſnare the idle minde,

A ſeeing ſcorpion, yet in ſeeing blinde,

A poore reioyce, a plague without teliefe,

D. Lodge.

Loue is a ſmoake made with fume of ſighes,

Being purg'd, a fier ſparkling in Louers eies,

Being vext, a ſea, nouriſht with louing teares,

What is it elſe? a madneſſe moſt diſtreſt,

A choaking gall, and a preſeruing ſweet.

W. Shakeſpeare.

It is a doubled griefe, a ſparke of pleaſure,

Begot by vaine deſire, and this his loue:

[[Page 174]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=94)Whom in our
youth, we count our chiefeſt treaſure.

In age for want of power we do reproue,

Yea ſuch a power is Loue, whoſe loſſe is paine,

And hauing got him, we repent againe.

D. Lodge.

Loue the Idle bodies worke and ſurfet of the eye.

W. Warner.

Loue is but a terme, like as is Eccho but a voice,

That this doth babble, that doth breed, or not, is ours the choice.

W. Warner.

—Loue is a ſubtill influence,

Whoſe finall force ſtill hangeth in ſuſpence.

D. Lodge.

Loue is a wanton famine, rich in foode,

But with a riper appetite controlled,

An argument in figure and in moode:

Yet hates all arguments; diſputing ſtill,

For ſence againſt reaſon, with a ſenceleſſe will.

G. Chapman.

Of euery ill the hatefull father vile,

That doth the world with ſorceries beguile,

Cunningly mad, religiouſly prophane,

Wits monſter, reaſons canker, ſences bane,

Loue taught the mother that vnkind deſire,

To waſh her hands in her owne Infants blood.

Loue taught the daughter to betray her fire

Into moſt baſe and worthy ſeruitude:

Loue taught the brother to prepare ſuch foode;

To feaſt his brothers, that all ſeeing ſunne

Wrapt in a cloude that wicked ſight did ſhunne.

I. Dauies.

[[Page 175]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=94)

Loue is a ſowre delight, a ſugred griefe,

A liuing death, an euer dying life,

A breach of reaſons law, a ſecret theefe,

A ſea of teares, an euerlaſting ſtrife.

A baite for fooles, a ſcourge of noble wits,

A deadly wound, a ſhot which euer hits,

Loue is a blinded god, and angry boy,

A labyrinth of doubts, an idle luſt,

A ſlaue to bewties will, a witleſſe toy.

A rauening bird, a tyrant moſt vniuſt,

A burning heate, a cold, a flattering ioy,

A priuate hell, a very world of woe.

Th. Ʋ Ʋatſon.

—Loue bewitcher of the wit.

The ſcorne of vertue, vices paraſite,

The ſlaue to weakeneſſe, friendſhips falſe bewraier,

Reaſons rebell, fortitudes betraier.

The churchmēs ſtaffe, court, camp, & countries guider,

Arts infection, chaſte thoughts, and youths defiler.

I. Ʋ Ʋeeuer.

Controlling Loue, proud fortunes buſie factor,

The gall of wit, ſad melancholies ſchoole,

Heart-killing corſiue, golden times detractor,

Life-fretting canker, miſchiefes poyſoned toole,

The Ideots ydle brother, wiſe mens foole.

A foe to friendſhip enemie to truth,

The wrong miſleader of our pleaſing youth.

M. Drayton.

—Loue is roote and onely crop of care,

The bodies foe, the hearts annoy, & cauſe of pleaſures rare.

[[Page 176]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=95)The
ſickneſſe of the minde, the fountaine of vnreſt,

The gulfe of guile, the pit of paine, of griefe the hollow cheſt:

A fiery froſt, a flame that frozen is with Ice,

A heauie burden, light to beare, a vertue fraught with vice.

It is a worldlike peace, a ſafetie ſeeing dread,

A deepe diſpaire, annext to hope, a fancie that is fed,

Sweete poyſon for his taſte, a port Charibdis like,

Aſcylla for his ſafetie, though a Lyon that is meeke.

Th. Turberuile.

— O brawling loue, O louing hate,

O any thing of nothing firſt created:

O heauie lightneſſe, ſerious vanitie,

Miſhapen Chaos of well ſeeing formes,

Feather of lead, bright ſmoke, cold fier, ſicknes, helth,

Still waking ſleepe, that is not what it is.

W. Shakespeare.

Sight is his roote, in thought is his progreſſion,

His childhood wonder, prentiſhip attention:

His youth delight, his age the ſoules opreſſion,

Doubt is his ſleepe, he waketh in inuention.

Fancie his foode, his cloathing carefulneſſe,

Beautie his booke, his play, Louers diſcention.

His eies are curious ſearch, but vaild with warefulneſſe,

His wings deſire, oft clipt with deſperation:

Largeſſe his hands, could neuer skill of ſparefulneſſe.

But how he doth by might or by perſwaſion,

To conquer, and his conqueſt how to ratifie,

Experience doubts, and ſchooles had diſputation.

S. Ph. Sidney.

Loue hath two ſhafts, the one of beaten gold,

By ſtroake whereof, a ſweete effect is wrought:

The other is of lumpiſh leaden mold,

[[Page 177]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=95)And worketh
no effect but what is nought.

Th. Watſon.

At Venus intreatie for Cupid her ſonne,

Theſe arrowes by Vulcan were cunningly done:

The firſt is Loue, as here you may behold,

His feathers head and body are of gold.

The ſecond ſhaft is Hate, a foe to loue,

And bitter are his torments for to proue.

The third is Hope, from whence our comfort ſprings,

His feathers are puld from Fortunes wings.

Fourth, Iealouſie in baſeſt mindes doth dwell,

This mettall Vulcans Cyclops ſent from hell.

G. Peele.

Hard is the doubt, and difficult to deeme,

When all three kinds of loue together meet:

And do diſpart the heart with power extreame,

Whether ſhall waigh the ballance downe; to weet

The deare affection vnto kindred ſweet,

Or raging fier of loue to woman kinde,

Or zeale of friends combinde with vertues meet.

But of them all the band of vertues minde,

Me ſeemes the gentle heart ſhould moſt aſſured finde.

Ed. Spencer.

Of vertue onely, perfect loue doth grow,

Whoſe firſt beginning though it be more ſlow

Then that of luſt, and quickens not ſo faſt:

Yet ſure it is, and longer time doth laſt.

The ſtrawe inkindles ſoone, and ſlakes againe,

But yron is ſlow, and long will heat retaine.

Th. Hudſon.

[[Page 178]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=96)

Moſt true it is that true loue hath no power

To looken back, his eyes be fixt before.

W. Sha.

Loue alwaies doth bring forth moſt bounteous deeds,

And in each gentle heart deſire of honor breeds.

True loue is free, and led with ſelfe delight,

Ne will inforced be with maſterdome or might.

Idem.

Loue naked boy hath nothing on his backe,

And though he wanteth neither arme nor legge,

Yet maim'd he is, ſith he his ſight doth lacke:

And yet (though blind) he bewtie can behold,

And yet though nak'd, he feeles more heat then cold.

H. C.

Loue ſtaies not long, it is but one yeares bird.

Th. Churchyard.

Loue muſt haue change to ſeaſon ſweet delight.

Idem.

Loue, lawes and Iudges hath in fee,

Nature and vſe his iudges bee:

To whom his whole courſe cenſures flee,

Since paſt, and things to come they ſee.

G. Chapman.

Loue is in power felt of all, in perſon found of none,

Or rather is not reall but ſome fancie; If not, then

Fantaſticall in women, but eſſentiall in men.

W. Warner.

Loues eyes in viewing neuer haue their fill.

W. Marlowe.

[[Page 179]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=96)

This is the leaſt effect of Cupids dart,

To change the mind by wounding of the hart.

Th. Watſon.

Vnto the woods runs loue, as well as rides to the pallace,

Neither he beares reuerence to a prince, nor pitie to beggere

But (like a point amidſt of a circle) ſtill of an euenneſſe,

All to a leſſon he drawes, neither hills nor caues can auoyd him.

S. Phil. Sidney.

The throne of Cupid hath an eaſie ſtaire,

His barke is fit to ſaile with euery winde:

The breach he makes, no wiſe man can repaire.

Ed. Fairfax.

—Loue will haue his godhead ſeene

In famous queenes, and higheſt princes hearts.

S. I. H.

Loue wants his eyes, yet ſhootes he paſſing right,

His ſhafts our thoughts, his bowe he makes our ſight,

His deadly pilles are tempered with ſuch art,

As ſtill directs the arrow to the hart.

M. Drayton.

—Loue doth raigne

In ſtouteſt minds, and maketh monſtrous warre,

He maketh warre, he maketh peace againe:

And yet his peace is but continuall warre,

O miſerable men, that to him ſubiect are.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 180]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=97)

Firſt loue is firme and toucheth very neare.

W. Warner.

Loue vnto life this cognizance doth giue,

This badge, this marke, to euery man that minds it:

Loue lendeth life, which liuing cannot die,

Nor liuing, loue.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Loue is too full of faith, too credulous,

With folly and falſe hope deluding vs.

Ch. Marlowe.

Loue is not full of mercy as men ſay,

But deafe and cruell where he meanes to pray.

Idem.

Loue paints his longings in ſweet virgins eyes.

G. Chapman.

—Loue gainſaid: growes madder then before.

Th. Watſon.

Loue findeth meane, but hatred knowes no meaſure.

Ed. Spencer.

As Bacchus opes diſſembled harts,

So loue ſets out our better parts.

M. Roydon.

As loue hath wreathes his pretie eyes to ſeare,

So louers muſt keep ſecret what they feare.

D. Lodge.

Loue keeps his reuels where there are but twaine.

W. Shakeſpeare.

As Iris coate in ſundry taints doth ſhowe,

So loue is clad in weale, and ſtrait in woe.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 181]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=97)

Loue can abide no law, loue alwaies loues to be lawleſſe,

Loue altereth nature, rules reaſon, maſtereth Olympus:

Lawes, edicts, deerees, contemnes Ioue mightily thundring.

Ioue that rules and raigns, that with beck bendeth Olympus.

Loue caried Hyppolitus with briars & thorns to be mangled

For that he had the faire foule lusting Phedra refuſed.

Loue made Abſyrtus with ſiſters hands to be murdred

And in peeces torne, and here and there to be ſcattered.

Loue forſt Paſiphae mans company long to be loathing,

And for a while bulls fleſh, bulls company long to be taking.

Loue and luring lookes of louely Polixena cauſed

Greekiſh Achilles death when he came to the church to be wedded.

Loue made Alcides that moſt inuincible Heros,

Maiſter of all monſters, at length to be whipt of a monſter.

Loue drownd Leander, ſwimming to the beautifull He [...]o,

Vnto the towne Ceſtos, from towne of curſed Abydos.

Loue made Ioue that's ruler of earth, and ruler of heauen,

Like to a ſilly ſhepheard, and like to the fruitfull Echidua.

Like to a fiſh, to a ſwan, a ſpawne, to a bull, to an eagle:

Sometimes Amphitrio, ſometimes Dictinua reſembling.

Ab. Fraunce.

Trifling attempts no ſerious acts aduance,

The fier of loue is blowne by dalliance.

G. Chapman.

—Where there growes a ſympathy of harts,

Each paſſion in the one, the other paineth:

And by euen carryage of the outward parts,

(Wherein the actuall worke of loue remaineth.)

The inward griefes, miſlikes and ioyes are taught,

And euery ſigne bewraies a ſecret thought.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 182]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=98)

Loue deeply grounded, hardly is diſſembled.

Ch. Marlowe.

O bold beleeuing loue, how hote it ſeemes,

Not to beleeue, and yet too credulous:

Thy weale and woe are both of them extreames,

Diſpaire and hope makes thee ridiculous.

The one doth flatter the inthoughts vnlikely,

The likely thoughts the other killeth quickly.

W. Sha.

Loue goes towards loue, as ſchoole boyes from their bookes,

But loue from loue toward ſchoole with heauy lookes.

Idem.

—Loue can comment vpon euery woe.

Idem.

Cupids deep riuers haue their ſhallow fordes

His griefe bring ioyes, his loſſe recompences.

He breeds the ſore, and cures vs of the paine,

Achilles launce, that wounds and heales againe.

Ed. Fairfax.

Wonder it is to ſee in diuers mindes,

How diuerſly loue doth his pageant play,

And ſhewes his power in variable kindes:

The baſer wit whoſe idle thoughts alway

Are wont to cleaue vnto the lowly clay.

It ſtirreth vp to ſenſuall deſire,

And in leaud ſloth to waſte his careleſſe day,

But in braue ſpirits it kindles goodly fire,

That to all hie deſert and honour doth aſpire.

Ed. Spencer.

Such ones, ill iudge of loue that cannot loue,

Ne in their frozen hearts feele kindly flame:

[[Page 183]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=98)For thy
they ought nothing vnknowne reproue,

Ne naturall affection faultleſſe blame.

For it of honor and all vertue is

The roote, and brings forth glorious fruites of fame.

That crowne true louers with immortall bliſſe,

The meed of them that loue, and do not liue amiſſe.

Idem.

The perſons muſt in paſſions iumpe elſe loue is but a game,

Nor thinke I of a womans graunt, but as a wooers game.

VV. Warner.

Pure loue ſaid ſhe, the pureſt grace purſues,

And there is contract not by application:

Of lippes or bodies, but of bodies vertues,

As in our elementall motion.

Starres by their powers, which are their heat and light,

Do heauenly workes, and that which hath probation

By vertue all contract hath the nobleſt plight,

Both for the laſting and affinitie

It hath with naturall diuinitie.

G. Chapman.

Loue is a lord of truth and loyaltie,

Lifting himſelfe out of the lowly duſt:

On golden plumes vp to the pureſt skie,

Aboue the reach of loathly ſinfull luſt.

Whoſe baſe affect through cowardly diſtruſt

Of his weake wings dare not to heauens flie,

But like a mold warpe in the earth doth lie.

Ed. Spencer.

—One louing howre

For many yeares of ſorrow can diſpence,

A dramme of ſweet, is worth a pound of ſowre.

Idem.

[[Page 184]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=99)

Loue and maieſtie dwell ill together.

S. Daniell.

The ioyes of loue, if they ſhould euer laſt

Without affliction or diſquietnes:

That worldly chaunces do among them caſt,

Would be on earth too great a bleſſednes.

Liker to heauen then mortall wretchednes:

Therefore the winged God to let men weet

That here on earth is no ſure happines,

A thouſand ſowres hath tempered with one ſweet,

To make it ſeeme more deare and daintie as is meet.

Ed. Spencer.

True it is ſaid, what euer man it ſaid,

That loue with gall and hony doth abound:

But if the one be with the other waid,

For euery dramme of hony therein found,

A pound of gall doth ouer it abound.

Idem.

Loue hath delight in ſweet delicious fruite,

Loue neuer takes good counſell for his friend.

Loue author is, and cauſe of idle care.

Loue is deſtraught of wit, he hath no end.

Loue ſhooteth ſhafts of burning hot deſire,

Loue burneth more then either flame or fire.

Loue doth much harme through Iealouſies aſſault.

Loue once imbrac't will hardly part againe.

Loue thinkes in breach of faith there is no fault.

Loue makes a ſport of others deadly paine.

Loue is a wanton childe, and loues to brall,

Loue with his warre brings many ſoules to thrall.

Th. Watſon.

[[Page 185]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=99)

—Gods themſelues are chaung'd by Loue,

Ioue ſteales from skies to lie by Laedaes ſide:

Arcas deſcends for faire Aglauraes ſake,

And Sol ſo ſoone as Daphne is eſpide,

To follow his chariot doth forſake.

Idem.

— The ſweeteſt honey,

Is loathſome in his owne deliciouſneſſe,

And in the taſt confounds the appetite,

Therefore Loue moderately long loue doth ſo,

Too ſwift arriues as tardie as too ſlowe.

W. Shakespeare.

— The rights

In which Loues beautious empreſſe moſt delights,

Are banquets, Doricke muſicke, midnight reuelling,

Plaies, maskes, and all that ſterne age counteth euill.

Ch. Marlowe.

Thoſe eaſily men credit whom they loue.

S. Daniell.

Play with the fire, yet die not in the flame,

Shew paſſion in thy words, but not in hart,

Leaſt whē thou think'ſt to bring thy thoughts in frame

Thou proue thy ſelfe a priſoner by thy art.

Play with theſe babes of loue, as Apes with glaſſes,

And put no truſt in feathers, wind or laſſes.

D. Lodge.

The greedie moone along her giddie ſpheare,

Boads not ſuch change in her inconſtant courſe,

No crinite comet in the waine of yeare,

No riſing rage nor ſwelling of ſourſe.

[[Page 186]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=100)As Loue in
ſhape, in ſubſtance and effect,

But Gods and men with fury doth infect,

A morning ſtarre (that peereth from the pride

Of ſiluer floate) bedew'd and ſparkling bright,

Borne from the ſecond forme of waters glide,

The queene of Loue, the miſtreſſe of delight.

Aye ſuch is loue in ſemblance at the firſt,

But his effects are cruell and accurſt.

D· Lod,

Albeit bewtie moues to loue, and loue doth make thee ſue,

Better at firſt be nonſuite, then at length not to ſubdue.

W. Warner.

It hath bene when as heartie loue did treat and tie the knot,

Though now if gold but lacking be, the wedding fadgeth not.

Idem.

Loue learnes rural wits and baſe borne brats to be reading,

Heartburning ſecrets, and wonders daintily written,

In faire flaming eyes, by the hand of louely Cupido.

A. Fraunce.

Loue nill conſent that bewties fiel [...] lie waſte.

Ed. Fairfax.

Tis often ſeene, Loue workes a man a weake deiected minde,

For euer ſeene, a womans loue doth alter as the winde.

W· VVarner.

No ſtile is held for baſe, where loue well named is,

Each eare ſuckes vp the words a true loue ſcattereth.

S. Ph. Sydney.

All loſſe is leſſe, and leſſe the infamy,

Then loſſe of loue to him that loues but one,

Ne may loue be compeld by maiſterie,

For as ſoone as maiſterie comes ſweete loue anon:

[[Page 187]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=100)Taketh his
nimble wings, and ſoone is gone.

Ed. Spencer.

For euery pleaſure that in loue is found,

A thouſand woes and more therein abound.

Th. Watſon.

Like as a nibling fiſh that halfe miſtruſts

The golden ſhew of an enticing baite,

Makes many offers for the thing ſhe luſts,

Daring to deale with that ſhe deemes deceite:

So plaies the amorous God with his faire prize,

Whom loue and luſt bids board, but ſhame denies.

Ch. Middleton.

From theſe hie hills as when a ſpring doth fall,

It thrilleth downe with ſtill and ſubtill courſe,

Of this and that it gathereth aide, and ſhall

Till wit haue iuſt done, flowed to ſtreame and force,

Then at the foote, it rageth ouer all:

So fareth Loue when he hath tane a courſe.

Rage is vaine reſiſtance vaileth none,

The firſt iſſue is remedie alone.

E. of Surrey.

Not all the writs Diana hath, can Cupids plaint remoue.

W. Warnaer.

— Lordly Loue is ſuch a Tyrant fell,

That where he rules, all power he doth expell.

Ed. Sp.

If Loue compelled be and cannot chuſe,

How can it gratefull or thanke worthy proue?

Loue muſt free harted be and voluntary,

[[Page 188]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=101)And not
enchaunted or by fate conſtrain'd.

Nor like that loue which did Ʋliſſes carry,

To Circes Ile with mightie charmes.

I. Dauies.

Where heate of Loue doth once poſſeſſe the hart,

There cares oppreſſe the minde, with wondrous ill,

Wit runnes awrie, not fearing ſubtill ſmart,

And fond deſire doth euer maiſter will.

The belly neither cares for meate nor drinke,

Nor ouerwatched eyes deſite to winke.

Footeſteps are falſe, and wauering too and fro,

The brightſome flower of beautie fades away,

Reaſon retires, and pleaſure brings in woe,

And wiſedome yeeldeth place to blacke decay.

Councell and fame, and friendſhip are condemned,

And baſhful ſhame, and Gods themſelues contēned.

Watchfull ſuſpect is kindled with diſpaire,

Inconſtant hope is often drownd in feares:

What folly hurts not, fortune can repaire,

And miſerie doth ſwim in ſeas of teares.

Long vſe of life is but a liuing foe,

As gentle death is onely end of woe.

Th. Watſon.

Vnlawfull meanes doth make loue lawfull gaine,

He ſpeakes moſt true when he the moſt doth faine.

M. Drayton.

As many bees, as Hybla daily ſheelds,

As many frie as fleet in Oceans face,

As many heards as on the earth do trace,

As many flowers as deckt the fragrant fields,

As many ſtarres as glorious heauen containes,

[[Page 189]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=101)As many
cloudes as wayward winter weepes,

As many plagues as hell encloſed keepes.

So many griefes in Loue, ſo many paines,

Suſpicions, thoughts, deſires, opinions, praiers,

Miſlikes, miſdeeds, fond ioyes, and fained peace,

Illuſions, dreames, great paines, and ſmall encreaſe,

Vowes, hope, acceptance ſcornes and deepe diſpaires.

D. Lodge.

The gnawing enuie, the heartfretting feare,

The vaine ſurmiſes, the diſtinctfull ſhewes,

The falſe reports that flying tales do beare,

The doubts, the dangers, the delaies, the woes,

The fained friends, the vnexpected foes,

With thouſand more then any tongue can tell,

Do make a Louers life a wretches hell.

Ed. Spencer.

Tis folly by our wiſeſt worldlings prou'd,

If not to gaine by loue) to be belou'd,

B. Ihonſon.

Againſt Loues fier feares froſt hath diſſolution.

W. Shakespeare.

— Greater conqueſt of hard Loue he gaines,

That workes it to his will, then he that it conſtraines.

Ed. Spencer.

[...]nto a Knight there is no greater ſhame,

Who can ſhew all his loue, can loue but lightly.

S. Daniell.

No man from the monarch loue by wit or weapō flies.

W. Warner.

— Loftie Loue doth loathe a lowly eye.

Ed. Spencer.

Loue thriues not in the heart, that ſhadowes dreadeth.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Gather I ſay, the Roſe while it is time,

For ſoone comes age that will her pride deflame:

Gather the Roſe of Loue while yet is time,

Whil'ſt louing, thou mai'ſt loued be with equall aime.

Ed. Sp.

O learne to loue, the leſſon is but plaine,

And once made perfect, neuer loſt againe.

Ʋ Ʋ. Shakeſpeare.

Louers their loued Ladies loues to gaine

Promiſe, proteſt and ſweare without regard,

That God doth ſee and know their falſhood ſtill,

And can and ſhall reuenge it at his will.

Their oathes but words, their words are all but wind,

Vttered in heart, and with like heart forgotten,

As bundles are truſt vp coards all rotten.

Coineſſe is nought, but worſt to be too kind;

Men care not for the good that ſoone is gotten:

But women of their wits may chiefly boaſt,

That are made wiſer by an others coſt.

S. I. H.

[[Page 191]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=102)

He that bindes himſelfe in worthy bands,

Although his ſhew but grace him ſmall:

Although he finde no fauour at her hands,

Sharp words, coy lookes, ſmall thanks, hope none at all,

Though more and more, aloofe from him ſhe ſtands:

Yet for his heart and thoughts be highly placed,

He muſt not mourne, although he die diſgraced.

Idem.

Dumbe Swans, not chattering Pies do Louers proue,

They loue indeed, who dare not ſay they loue.

S. Ph. Sydney.

The Louer and beloued are not tied to one Loue.

Ʋ Ʋ. Sh.

He that on Loues blind ſnares once ſets his foote,

Seemeth to draw it backe, but findes it caught,

And madneſſe meere in Loue to ouerſhoote,

The foole hath felt, the wiſe hath euer taught.

And though in all alike it take not roote,

Yet all ſhall finde, Loue is a thing of nought.

For ſure it is, an open ſigne of madneſſe,

To haue an others pleaſure breed thy ſadneſſe.

S. I. Harrington.

The birds their beake, the lion hath his taile,

And louers nought but ſighes and bitter moane,

The ſpotleſſe force of fancie to aſſaile.

D. Lodge.

Sweete are the kiſſes, the embracements ſweete,

When like deſires, and affections meete:

For from the earth to heauen is Cupid raiſed,

Where fancie is in equall ballance peized.

Ch. Marlowe.

[[Page 192]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=103)

Foule words and frownes muſt not repell a Louer,

What though the Roſe hath prickles, yet tis pluckt,

Were bewtie vnder twentie locks kept faſt,

Yet Loue breakes through, and breakes them all at laſt,

W. Shakespeare.

— Louers houres are long, though ſeeming ſhort,

If pleaſde themſelues, others they delight:

In ſuch like circumſtance, with ſuch like ſport,

Their copious ſtories oftentimes begun,

End without audience, and are neuer done.

Idem.

A Louer may beſtride the Goſſamours,

That Idles in the wanton ſommer aire,

And yet not full ſo light is vanitie.

Idem.

The Dutch in loue is proude, Italians enuious,

The French man full of mirth, the Spanyard furious.

### 1.102. Magicke.

Three kindes there are for natures skill:

The firſt they naturall do name,

In which by hearbes and ſtones they will

Worke wondrous things, and worthy fame.

The next is Mathematicall,

Where Magicke workes by nature ſo,

That brazen heads make ſpeake it ſhall,

Of woods, birds, bodies, flie and go,

The third Veneficall, by right

Is named, for by it they make

The ſhape of bodies chang'd in ſight

And their formes on them to take.

M. of M.

[[Page 193]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=103)

—Oh who can tell

The hidden power of hearbes, and might of magicke skill?

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.103. Man.

In time conuenient this world Almightie created,

And it a large theater to behold, his glory appointed:

Which whē he had with ſtore of treaſures richly repleniſht,

And with aboundant grace causd euery part to be furniſht,

Man was made at length, Adam was quickly created

Moſt perfect creature, and like to the mightie Creator,

Good wit, immortall, of mankind only beginner.

But proud ambition the ſerpent craftily cloaking,

With curſt and bitter ſweete, his cankred poyſon abounding.

Adam diſpoſſeſt of pleaſant beautifull harbors.

Adams heart poſſeſt with moſt vnſpeakable horrors.

Man was mard at length, Adam was fouly defaced.

Laſt worke and loſt worke, Adam was filthily fowled:

Moſt curſed creature, vnlike to the mightie Creator,

Bad, fooliſh, mortall, of mankind only the murderer.

A. France.

—Vile man begot of clay, and borne of duſt.

Ed. Fairfax.

Man compoſed firſt of ſlime,

Doth liue to lead his daies in ſtrife:

And as the heauens do that diſpoſe,

So ſhuts and ſpreads he with the roſe.

D. Lodge.

Time ouer old and yoong is ſtill reuolued,

Within it ſelfe, and neuer taſteth end:

But mankind is to nought for aye reſerued,

[[Page 194]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=104)The filthy
ſnake her aged coat can mend.

And getting youth againe, in youth doth flouriſh:

But vnto man age euer death doth ſend.

The very trees with grafting we can cheriſh:

So that we can long time produce their time,

But man which helpeth them, helpleſſe muſt periſh.

S. Phil. Sidney.

O truſtleſſe ſtate of miſerable men,

That build your bliſſe on hope of earthly thing:

And vainly thinke your ſelues halfe happie then,

When painted faces with ſmooth flattering

Do fawne on you, and your wide praiſes ſing.

And when the courting masker louteth low,

Him free in heart, and truſtie too you know.

Ed. Spencer.

He that comparde mans body to a hoaſte,

Said that the hands were ſcouts diſcouering harmes:

The feet were horſemen thundering on the coaſte.

The breſt and ſtomacke foe men, huge in ſwarmes,

But for the head in ſoueraigntie did boaſt,

It captaine was, directer of alarmes.

Whoſe raſhneſſe if it hazarded any ill,

Not he alone, but all the hoaſt did ſpill.

I. Markeham.

Each creature not grudging at mans glorie,

Vnto his life becomes contributorie.

Idem.

Like flouds in ſommer, or flowing ſprings in the win­ter,

So man conſumeth:

No truſt or firmeneſſe in life, that flies like a ſhadow?

What then alas is man

That ſo preſumeth?

D. Lodge.

[[Page 195]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=104)

The ſhadow of the clocke by motion wends,

We ſee it paſſe, yet marke not when it parts:

So what is mans declines, and ſudden ends,

Each thing begins, continues and conuerts.

Idem.

—Man to woman giueth all perfection,

And as our chiefe Philoſophers do ſay,

Woman by man is perfect made each way.

I. VVeeuer.

—Man is loaden with ten thouſand languors,

All other creatures only feele the angors

Of fewe diſeaſes; as the gleaming quaile,

Only the falling ſicknes doth aſſaile.

The turne-about and murraine trouble cattle,

Madneſſe and quincie bid the maſtife battle.

I. Silueſter.

[...]t doth exceed mans thought to thinke how hie

God hath raiſd man, ſince God a man became:

The Angels do admire this myſterie,

And are aſtoniſht when they view the ſame.

I. Dauies.

Men do not know what they themſelues will bee,

When as more then themſelues, themſelues they ſee.

S. Daniell.

[...]ike as the fatall rauen that in his voyce

[...]arries the dreadfull ſummons of our deaths,

[...]ies by the faire Arabian ſpiceries,

[...]er pleaſant gardens and delightfull parts,

[...]eeming to curſe them with his hoarſe exclaimes:

[...]nd yet doth ſtoupe with hungry violence,

[...]pon a peece of hatefull carrion.

[[Page 196]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=105)So
wretched man diſpleaſ'd with thoſe delights,

Would yeeld a quickning ſauour to his ſoule,

Purſues with eager and vnſtanched thirſt,

The greedy longings of his loathſome fleſh.

G. Peele.

Man is a little world, and beares the face

And picture of the vniuerſitie:

All but reſembleth God, all but is glaſſe,

All but the picture of his maieſtie.

Man is the little world (ſo we him call)

The world the little God, God the great all.

Th. Baſtard.

The gallant courſer in his full carrire

Is made by man to ſtoppe with ſlender raine:

But man himſelfe his luſt and fond deſire

Is ſildome drawne by reaſon to refraine.

Tis hard to ſtop, but harder to retire,

When youthfull courſe enſueth pleaſure vaine.

As beares do breake the hiues and weake defences,

When ſmell of hony commeth to their ſences.

S. I. H.

Great Pompey in the midſt of victorie,

All vnexpected happened to his end:

And Caeſar in his greateſt maieſtie

Vntimely murdered by his deareſt friend.

Such are mens beſt eſtates, more wretched they,

In greateſt pompe moſt ſubiect to decay.

Ch. Midleton.

What doth make men without the parts of men,

Or in their manhoods leſſe then children

But manleſſe natures? all this world was namd'd

[[Page 197]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=105)A world of
him for whom it firſt was framde

(Who like a tender cheuerell ſhrunke with fire

Of baſe ambition, and of ſelfe deſire)

His armes into his ſhoulders crept, for feare

Bountie ſhould vſe them, and fierce rape forbeare,

His legs into his greedy belly runne,

The charge of hoſpitalitie to ſhunne)

In him the world is to a lumpe reuerſt:

That ſhrunke from forme that was by forme diſperſt.

And in nought more then thankleſſe auarice,

Not rendring vertue her deſerued price.

G. Chapman.

Like as rude Painters that contend to ſhowe

Beaſts, fowles, or fiſh, all artleſſe to beſtowe

On euery ſide his natiue counterfet,

Aboue his head his name had need to ſet.

So men that will be men in more then fate

(As in their forheads) ſhould in actions place

More perfect characters to proue they be

No mockers of their firſt nobilitie.

Els may they eaſily paſſe for beaſts or foules,

Soules praiſe our ſhapes, and not our ſhapes our ſoules.

Idem.

When as men all do know, then nothing know.

S. Daniell.

—The milder paſſions doth ſhow man.

For as the leafe doth bewtifie the tree,

The pleaſant flowers bedeck the flouriſhing ſpring,

Euen ſo in men of greateſt reach and power,

A mild and piteous thought augments renowne.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 198]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=106)

No man before his end is truly bleſt.

T. Dekkar.

—Man to man, as beaſt to beaſt, holds ciuil duties vain.

W. Warner.

Mans inward parts are colder and the nummer,

When outwardly they feele a boyling ſommer.

Mans voyce in euery ones opinion, is but an airie repercuſſion▪

D. Lodge.

### 1.104. Marriage.

Hymen that now is god of nuptiall rights,

And crownes with honor loue and his delights.

G. Chapman.

Before them on an altar he preſented

Both fire and water, which was firſt inuented:

Since to ingenerate euery humane creature

And euery other birth produc'ſt by nature,

Moyſture and heate, muſt mix, ſo man and wife

For humane race, muſt ioyne in nuptiall life.

Idem.

—In Athence

The cuſtome was, that euery mayd did weare

During her maydenhead, a ſilken ſpheare:

About her waſte aboue her inmoſt weed

Knit with Mineruaes knot, and that was freed

By the faire bridegroome on the mariage night,

With many ceremonies of delight.

Idem.

Shouldſt thou but dream what mariage is, thou wouldſt not liue a maid,

One hart of two, two ſoules of one, by wedlocke is conuaid.

Ʋ Ʋ. VVarner.

Beleeue me man, there is no greater bliſſe,

[[Page 199]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=106)Then is
the quiet ioy of louing wife:

Which who ſo wants, halfe of himſelfe doth miſſe.

Friend without change, play-fellow without ſtrife.

Food without fulneſſe, counſaile without pride,

Is this ſweet doubling of our ſingle life.

S. Phil. Sidney.

In choyce of wife, preferre the modeſt chaſte,

Lillies are faire in ſhew, but foule in ſmell:

The ſweeteſt lookes by age are ſoone defaſte,

Then chooſe thy wife by wit and louing well.

Who brings thee wealth, and many faults withall,

Preſents thee hony mixt with bitter gall.

D. Lodge.

Wild ſauages that drinkes of running ſprings,

Thinkes water faire, exceeds all other things.

But they that daily taſte meate, nere deſpi [...]e it,

Virginitie, al be ſome highly priſe it,

Compar'd with marriage, had you tride them both,

Differs as much, as wine and water doth.

Ch. Marlow.

All touch ſweet, taſt ſweet, eie ſweet, eare ſweet, ſweet ſence, ſweet ſou
[...]e is,

A vertuous match, but vicious loue in all contrary this.

W. Warner.

One is no number, maides are nothing then

Without the ſweet ſocietie of men.

Ch. Marlow.

—Marriage will ſoone deſtroy

Thoſe paſſions which to youthfull head do clime,

Mothers and nurſes of all vaine annoy.

Idem.

—Wretched wedlock breeds but hated heat,

Where no loue ſeemes ſo ſweet, as ſtolen and ſecret.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 200]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=107)

Offer no loue rights, but let wiues ſtill ſeeke them,

For when they come vnſought, they ſildom like them.

B. Iohnſon.

—Euen as Adam wrote his ouerthrow

By taſting fruite that God did him forbid,

So he that curiouſly will ſearch to know

All that his wife hath ſaid, or what ſhe did,

May fortune at the laſt himſelfe beſhrow.

S. I. H.

Let him that his wife to his bent will drawe,

Match with a virgin and keepe her in awe.

To loue, and wed for loue, is perfit bliſſe.

G. Turb.

His be the hurt that lookes not ere he wed.

The husband may the woman make or marre.

Idem.

We are not male nor female borne, that we ſhould fruitleſſe die.

W. Warner.

—Experience bidding vs, doth bid vs lay to thriue.

The firſt degree to which ſay ſome, is warily to wine:

But wife if ſhrow or ſaint become (as not vnlike) a ſhrow,

Then is that firſt degree to thrift, the third degree in woe.

Idem.

Let nothing ſeuere thoſe whom God doth linke.

S. I. H.

—The chance that once befell

To wandring Dina, may be witneſſe well

That ſecret mariage that to fewe is kend,

Doth neuer lead the louers to good end.

For of our bodies we no power may claime,

Except our parents do confirme the ſame.

Th. Hud.

We worldly folkes account him very wiſe,

That hath the wit moſt worthily to wed,

[[Page 201]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=107)By all
meanes therefore, alwaies we deuiſe

To ſee our iſſue rich in ſpouſall fed,

We buy and ſell rich Orphans; babes ſcant bred

Muſt match, ere they do know what marriage meanes:

Boyes marrie old trots, old fooles wed yoong queanes.

We call this wedding, which in any wiſe

Can be no marriage, but pollution plaine:

A new found trade of humaine marchandize,

The diuells net, a filthy fleſhly gaine,

Of kind and nature, an vnnaturall ſtaine:

A foule abuſe of Gods moſt holy order,

And yet allow'd almoſt in euery border.

M. of M.

A filthy trull, is irkſome to the eie,

A gallant gyrle allures the lookers mind:

A wanton wench will haue the head to die,

An aged trot to like, is hard to find.

A bearing wife with brats, will cloy the ſtore,

A greater care then childrens care is none:

A barren beaſt will grieue thee ten times more,

No ioy remaines when ſappe of fruite is gone.

Wherefore let wiuing goe liue ſingle aye,

A ſhrew we ſee is wedded on a day,

But ere a man can ſhift his hands tis long.

G. Turb.

### 1.105. Maladie.

Faſt by old age pale Maladie was plac't,

Sore ſicke in bed her colour all forgone,

Bereft of ſtomacke, ſauour, and of taſte,

Ne could ſhe brook no meate but broaths alone.

[[Page 202]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=108)Abhorring
her, her ſickneſſe paſt recure,

Deteſting phiſicke, and all phiſicks cure.

M. i Sackuill.

Sickneſſe the herauld of armes, hearts, and all.

Th. Storer.

Th'humorous ſicke, remouing, find no eaſe,

When chaunged chambers helpe not the diſeaſe.

S. Dauiell.

— O ſickneſſe thou art oft betide,

When death hath many woes to come beſide.

Idem.

### 1.106. Might.

The meaneſt fault is hie offence, vrg'd of a mighty foe.

W. Warner.

To ſhadow ſinne Might can the more pretend.

M. Dr.

— Might is euer abſolute alone,

When of two powers ther's true coniunctione.

Idem.

Power conſtrain'd is but a glorious ſlaue.

Ed. Fairfax.

— Slight, force, are mightie things,

From which, much, if not moſt, earths glory ſprings:

If vertues ſelfe were clad in humaine ſhape,

Vertue without theſe, might go beg and ſcrape.

I. Marſton.

Vnited powers, makes each the ſtronger proue.

S. Ph. Sydney.

— Honey words make fooliſhneſſe,

And power the greateſt wit with error blinds.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 203]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=108)

All as the higheſt trees do ſheeld the ſhrubs,

From poſting Phlegons warmth, and warming fier,

So mightie men obſcure each others fame,

And make the beſt deſeruer fortunes game.

Idem.

— Excellencie neuer beares this minde,

By no inferiour skill to be definde.

Th. Storer.

Where power decreed hath to find th'offence,

The cauſe is better ſtill, then the defence.

S. Daniell.

### 1.107. Miſerie.

His face was leane and ſome deale pinde away,

And eke his hands conſumed to the bone:

But what his body was I cannot ſay,

For on his carkaſſe, rayment had he none.

Saue cloutes and patches peeced one by one,

With ſtaffe in hand, and ſcrippe on ſhoulder caſt,

His chiefe defence againſt the winters blaſt.

His food for moſt, was wilde fruites of the tree,

Vnleſſe ſometimes, ſome crummes fell to his ſhare,

Which in his wallet long, God-wot kept he,

As one the which full daintily would fare:

His drinke the running ſtreame his cup, the bare

Of his palme clozd, his bed the hard cold ground,

To this poore life, was Miſerie ybound.

M. Sackuill.

— This Iron world

Brings downe the ſtouteſt hearts to loweſt ſtate,

For Miſerie doth braueſt mindes abate,

[[Page 204]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=109)And makes
them ſeeke for that they wont to ſcorne,

Of fortune and of hope, at once forlorne.

Ed. Spencer.

—He hath a fooliſh fantaſie,

That thinkes to find a friend in miſerie.

G. Gaſcoigne.

O Miſerie, where once thou art poſſeſt,

How ſoone thy faint infection alters kind,

And like a Circe, turneſt man to beaſt,

And with the body doſt tranſforme the mind,

That can in fetters our affection bind.

M. Drayton.

— Miſerie is troden on by many,

But being lowe, neuer relieu'd by any.

W. Shakespeare.

— The mightieſt that haue liu'd,

Haue falne and headlong too, in Miſerie,

It is ſome comfort to haue companie.

G. Peele.

Men flie from foes, but not from Miſerie.

M. Drayton.

Let him that ſees his priuate Miſerie

Auoyd the proſpect of proſperitie:

It breeds pale enuie, and ſad diſcontent

Procures offence before a profered wrong.

Torments it ſelfe till all conceits are ſpent,

And thoughts deliuered by malitious tongue,

Then rapt with violent fury goes ſo ſtrong,

That it enuenomes all our humaine parts,

Blind iudging in eyes, and ſence confounding harts.

Th. Storer.

[[Page 205]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=109)

### 1.108. Melancholy.

— Melancholy from the ſplene begunne,

By paſſion mou'd, into the vaines doth runne:

Which when this humour as a ſwelling floud,

By vigour is infuſed in the bloud,

The vitall ſpirits doth mightily appall,

And weakeneth ſo the parts Organicall,

And when the ſences are diſturb'd and tir'd,

With what the heart inceſſantly deſir'd·

Like trauellers with labour long oppreſt,

Finding reliefe, eftſoones they fall to reſt.

M. Drayton.

Thou nurſing mother of faire wiſedomes lore,

Ingenious Melancholy.

I. Marston.

Thoſe men to Melancholy giuen, we Saturniſts do call.

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

### 1.109. Memorie.

This Lidger booke lies in rhe braine behinde,

Like Ianus eye which in his poll was ſet:

The lay mans table, Storehouſe of the minde,

Which doth remember much, and much forget.

I. Dauies.

Here ſences apprehenſions end doth take,

As when a ſtone is into water caſt:

One circle, doth an other circle make,

Till the laſt circle touch the banke at laſt.

Idem.

Remēbrance is the life of grief, his graue forgetfulnes.

Ed. Fairfax.

[[Page 206]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=110)

Remembrance freſh, makes weakened ſorrows ſtrong.

Idem.

### 1.110. Miſchiefe.

The cauſe once gone, th'ffects thereof ſurceaſe,

And miſchiefes being preuented whil'ſt they are yong

Cannot braunch forth themſelues to do that hurt,

That time, their natures, and bad men would worke.

Ch. Middleton.

A Miſchife ſeene may eaſily be preuented,

But being hapt, not helpt, yet ſtill lamented.

M. Drayton.

Faire goodneſſe is foule ill, if miſchiefes wit,

Be not repreſt from leaud corrupting it.

Idem.

Miſchiefe is oft made good by ſpeeding well.

S. Daniell.

### 1.111. Mercie.

Some Clarkes do doubt in their deuiſefull art,

Whether this heauenly thing whereof I treat,

To weeten Mercie be of Iuſtice part,

Or drawne forth from her by diuine extreat.

This well I wot, that ſure ſhe as great,

And meriteth to haue ſo hie a place:

She firſt was bred and borne of heauenly race,

From thence powr'd downe of men by influence of grace.

Ed. Spencer.

O who ſhall ſhew the countenance and geſtures

Of Mercie and iuſtice; which faire ſacred ſiſters,

With equall poize do euer ballance euen,

[[Page
207]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=110)Th'vnchaunging
proiects of the King of heauen.

Th'one ſterne of looke, th'other mild aſpecting,

The'one pleaſd with teares, th'other bloud affecting:

Th'one beares the ſword of vengeance vnrelenting,

Th'other brings pardon for the true repenting.

I. Syluicter.

— Still as rage kindleth the fire of wrath,

Mercie to quench it, ſtore of water hath.

S. I. Harrington.

— This noble vertue and diuine,

Doth chiefly make a man ſo rare and od,

As in that one, he moſt reſembleth God.

Idem.

Then come we neareſt to the Gods on hie,

When we are fartheſt from extremitie,

Giuing forth ſentence of our Lawes with Mercie.

Tho. Achely.

Mercie may mend whom malice made offend,

Death giues no thankes, but checks authoritie,

So Rulers mildneſſe, ſubiects loue do nouriſh.

S. Daniell.

Soft pittie enters at an Iron gate.

Ʋ Ʋ. Sh.

Mercie but murders, pardoning thoſe that kill.

Idem.

Pittie drawes loue bloud-ſhed, as natures griefe,

Compaſſion, followeth the vnfortunate.

S. D.

Ʋ Ʋhen pittie runneth afore, loue alwaies followeth after,

A. Fraunce.

As it is greater praiſe to ſaue then ſpill,

So better to reforme, then to cut off the ill.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 208]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=111)

How deare is mercie hauing power and will,

When pittie helpes where equitie doth kill?

M. Drayton.

### 1.112. Minde.

The Minde hath in it ſelfe a deitie,

And in the ſtretching circle of her eie,

All things are compaſt, all things preſent ſtill

Will fram'd to power, doth make vs what we will.

G. Chapman.

It is the minde that maketh good or ill,

That makes a wretch, or happie, rich or poore,

For ſome that haue a boundance at their will,

Haue not inough, but want in greateſt ſtore.

An other that hath little, askes no more,

But in that little is both rich and wiſe.

Ed. Spencer.

The Minde is free what ere afflict the man,

A King's a King, do fortune what ſhe can.

M. Drayton.

— The Minde times enemie, obliuions foe,

Diſpoſer true of each note worthy thing.

Ed. Fairfax.

Our mindes diſcerne where eies could neuer ſee.

M. Draiton.

— That Minde moſt is bewtifull and hie,

And neareſt comes to a diuinitie,

That fartheſt is from ſpots of earthes delight,

Pleaſures that looſe their ſubſtance with their ſight,

Such one Saturnius rauiſheth to loue,

And fills the cup of all content to Ioue.

G. Chapman.

[[Page 209]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=111)

The ſetled mind is free from fortunes power,

They need not feare who looke not vp aloft:

But they that are too carefull euery hower,

For when they fall they light not very ſoft.

M. of M.

What plague is greater then the griefe of minde?

The griefe of mind that eates in euery vaine:

In euery vaine that leaues ſuch clods behinde,

Such clods behind as breed ſuch bitter paine.

So bitter paine that none ſhall euer finde

What plague is greater then the griefe of minde.

E. of Ox.

Ill mind, to mind ſo much of others ill,

As to become vnmindfull of his owne.

Ed. Spencer.

Into our minds let vs a little fall,

And we ſhall finde more ſpots then leopards haue.

S. Phil. Sidner.

O vanitie of mans vnſtable minde,

Puft vp with euery blaſt of friendly winde.

Ed. Fairfax.

In baſe minds no friendſhip dwels, nor emnitie.

Ed. Spencer.

Oft times we ſee that ſorrowes of the minde

Finde remedie vnſought, which ſeeking cannot finde.

Ed. Spencer.

Weak body wel is chang'd, for minds redoubled force.

Idem.

So moue our minds, as motions moue the aire.

M. of M.

Nor is it his our minds that make our natiue homes our graue,

[[Page 210]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=112) As we to
ours, others to theirs, like parciall fancie haue.

Tranſmut we but our minds, and then all one an alien is,

As if a natiue once reſolu'd, makes euery country his.

VV. Warner.

### 1.113. Monarchs.

Auguſtus quailing Anthony, was Emperour alone,

In whoſe vnfoed Monarchy our common health was knowne

W. Warner.

A mighty monarch muſt whileſt greening youth doth flowe,

Make one or two or three proofes of his peerles power:

For valour is the gate of honour beautified,

The firſt ſtaire ſtep it is, wherby good hap doth guide,

Our feete to glories mount; and nothing hartens ſo

The men of armes to fight, as valiant prince (we know)

But afterward he muſt with wary wiſedome warre:

More often with his wit, then with his weapon farre.

And feeding ſo his ſpirit with ſweet ſharpe eaſie paine

Not keep a ſouldiers place, but captains roome retaine.

I. Sylueſter.

Mildneſſe fitteth maieſtie, hie minds are diſalowed.

VV. Warner.

No man from the Monarch loue by wealth, or weapon flies.

Idem.

Mildneſſe would better ſuite with maieſtie

Then raſh reuenge and rough ſeueritie.

M. Dray.

### 1.114. Murder.

Black hell-bred humor of fier-venging ſin,

By whoſe inticements murders we commit:

The end vnthought of, raſhly we begin,

Letting our paſſion ouerwhelme our wit.

[[Page 211]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=112)Who may
and will not, murder in truth committeth.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Vnpuniſht ſcapes, from hainous crime ſome one,

But vnreueng'd, in mind and body none.

Idem.

The cruell man a cruell death ſhall taſt,

And blood with blood be venged at the laſt.

I. Syl.

Thoſe that in blood ſuch violent pleaſure haue,

Seldome deſcend but bleeding to their graue.

B. Iohnſon.

Vengeance on minde the fretting furies take,

The ſinfull corps like earth-quake agues ſhake.

Their frowning lookes, their troubled minds bewray,

In haſt they run, and midſt their race they ſtay.

As gidded Doe: amidſt their ſpeech they whiſt,

At meate they muſe; no where they may perſiſt.

But ſome feare netleth them, aye hang they ſo,

So neuer wants the wicked murderer woe.

M. of M.

### 1.115. Muſes.

Imps of K. Ioue, and Queene remembrance loe,

The Siſters nine, the Poets pleaſant pheers:

Calliope doth ſtately ſtyle beſtowe,

And worthy praiſes paints of princely peers.

Clio in ſullen ſongs reneweth all day,

With preſent yeares conioyning age by paſt,

Delightfull talke, loues comicall Thalia.

In freſh green youth, who doth lawrell taſt.

With voyces tragicall ſounds Melpomen,

[[Page 212]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=113)And as
with chaines th' allured eares ſhe binds,

Her ſtrings when Terpſichore doth touch, euen then

She toucheth hearts, and raigneth in mens minds,

Fond Erato, whoſe looke a louely cheare

Preſents in dauncing, beares a comely grace,

With ſeemly geſture doth Polhymnie ſtirre place.

Whoſe words whole routs of rankes doo rule,

Ʋraine her globes to view are bent,

The nine-fold heauen obſerues with fixed face,

The bleſſed Eutrope tunes her inſtrument

With ſolace ſweete, hence heauy dumps to chace,

Lord Phaebus in the midſt whoſe heauenly ſpirit

Theſe Ladies doth inſpire.

E. of Surrey.

The golden brood of great Apolloes witte.

Ed. Spencer.

Sweet Lady Muſes, Ladies of delight,

Delights of life, and ornaments of light.

Idem.

Then followed on the Muſes ſacred nine,

With the firſt number equally diuine:

In virgins white, whoſe liuely mayden browes

Were couered with tryumphant lawrell browes:

And on their garments painted out in glory,

Their offices and functions in a ſtory:

Imblazoning the fury and conceat

VVhich on their ſacred company await.

M. Drayton.

From theſe the Muſes only are deriu'd,

[[Page 213]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=113)VVhich of
the Angels were in nine contriu'd,

Theſe heauenly inſpired babes of memory,

VVhich by a like attracting ſympathy

Apolloes prophets in their furies wrought,

And in their ſpirit inchaunting numbers taught,

To teach ſuch as at poeſie repine,

That it is only heauenly and diuine.

And manifeſt her intellectuall parts,

Sucking the pureſt of the pureſt arts.

And vnto theſe as by a ſweet conſent,

The ſphery circles are aequiualent:

From the firſt mouer and the ſtarry heauen,

To glorious Phaebe, loweſt of the ſeuen.

Which Ioue in tunefull Diapazons framde,

Of heauenly muſicke of the Muſes namde:

To which the ſoule in her diuinitie

By her Creator made of harmonie,

Whileſt ſhe in fraile and mortall fleſh doth liue,

To her nine ſundry offices do giue:

Which offices vnited are in three,

Which like the orders of the Angels bee,

Prefiguring thus by the number nine

The ſoule, like to the Angels is diuine.

Idem.

—Prouide ye Princes whileſt ye liue,

That of the Muſes ye be friended be:

Which vnto men eternitie doth giue,

For they be daughters of dame memorie,

And Ioue, the father of Eternitie.

And do thoſe men in golden chrones repoſe,

Whoſe merits they to glorifie do chooſe?

[[Page 214]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=114)The
ſeuenfold yron gates of griſly hell,

And horrid houſe of ſad Proſerpina,

They able are with power of mighty ſpell,

To breake, and thence the ſoules to bring away

Out of dread darkneſſe to eternall day.

And them immortall make which els would die

In fowle forgetfulneſſe, and nameleſſe lie.

Ed. Spencer.

—Wiſe words taught in numbers for to runne

Recorded by the Muſes liue for aye,

Ne may with ſtorming ſhowers be waſht away.

Ne bitter breathing windes with harmfull blaſt,

Nor age nor enuie ſhall them euer laſt.

Idem.

The Muſes not long ſince intrapping loue

In chaines of Roſes linked all aray:

Gaue bewtie charge to watch in their behoue

With Graces three, leaſt he ſhould wend away.

Who fearing yet he would eſcape at laſt,

On hie Parnaſſus top they clapt him faſt.

When Ʋenus vnderſtood her ſoone was thrall,

She made poſt-haſte to haue god Vulcans aide:

Sold him her Iemmes and Ceſton therewithall,

To raunſome home her ſonne that was betraid.

But all in vaine, the Muſes made no ſtore

Of gold, but bound him faſter then before.

Th. VVatſon.

The Muſes baſely beg or bibbe, or both, and muſt, for why

They find as bad Beſtoe, as is their portly beggery.

vv' vvarner.

[[Page 215]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=114)

### 1.116. Muſicke.

—Thou ſweet Muſicke, dauncings only life,

The eares ſole happineſſe, the aires beſt ſpeech:

Load-ſtone of fellowſhip, charming rod of ſtrife,

The ſoft minds paradize, the ſicke mans leech.

With their own tongue that trees & ſtones canſt teach.

That when the aire doth daunce her fineſt meaſure,

Then art thou borne, the gods and mens ſweet plea­ſure.

I. Dauies.

As without breath no pipe doth moue,

No Muſicke kindly without loue.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Eſclepiad did cure with Trompets ſound,

Such men as firſt had loſt their hearing quite:

And many ſuch as in their drinke lay drownd,

Damon reuiu'd with tunes of graue delight.

And Theophraſt when ought his mind oppreſt,

Vſde Muſicke ſound to bring himſelfe to reſt.

With ſound of Harpe Thales did make recure

Of ſuch as laie with peſtilence forlorne:

With Organ pipes Xenocrates made pure

Their wittes, whoſe minds long lunacy had worne.

Th. Ʋ Ʋatſon.

Some that report great Alexanders life,

They ſay that harmony ſo mou'd his minde:

That oft he roſe from meate to warlike ſtrife,

At ſound of Trompe, or noyſe of battell kinde.

And then that Muſicks force of ſofter vaine,

Cauſ'd him returne from ſtrokes to meate againe.

Idem.

[[Page 216]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=115)

### 1.117. Nature.

Nature in which diuinitie doth ſhine,

Liuely preſenting vnborne deitie:

Is that ſame ſpirit of reaſon moſt diuine,

Which cauſeth euery naturall worke to be.

All things ſhe doth preſerue, and can refine

Muddy pollutions from impietie.

Philoſophy can teach no art nor ground,

Which Nature (elder borne) had not firſt found.

I. Markham.

—Nature in mans heart her lawes doth pen,

Preſcribing truth to wit, and good to will,

Which do accuſe, or els excuſe all men,

For euery thought or practiſe good or ill.

I. Dauies.

Nature aboue all things requireth this,

That we our kind do labour to maintaine.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Nature which headlong into life doth throng vs

With our feete forward to our graue doth bring vs:

What is leſſe ours, then this our borrowed breath▪

We ſtumble into life, we go to death.

Th. Baſtard.

Inexplicable nature by the God of nature wroght,

Makes things ſeeme miracles to ſome, to ſome not wonders thoght.

And euery climates people both as they are men and liue,

Do differ: if obſeru'd, ſhe not admir'd doth giue

The workman rather thē the work extoll we, though in her

Not curiouſly, and all things to his prouidence refer.

W. Warner.

[[Page 217]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=115)

Nature hath powr'd inough in each mans lappe,

Could each man learne to vſe his priuate happe.

Th. Storer.

— Markes deſcried in mens natiuitie,

Are natures faults, not their owne infamie.

Ʋ Ʋ. Shakeſpeare.

Nature is Learnings eyes, ſhe natures thought,

Vſe wanting either, is imperfect made,

They without vſe, no better then a ſhade.

I. Markham.

— Nature ſeemeth onely faire in chaunge.

D. Lodge.

—Where nature failes in ſtrength ſhe addes in wit.

W. W.

Nature giues bewtie, fortune wealth in vaine.

Ed. Fairfax.

—The deſire of nature is not vaine,

She couets not impoſſibilities,

Fond thoughts may fall into ſome Idle braine,

But one aſſent of all is euer wiſe.

I. Dauies.

Nature doth hate and ſhunne her contrarie.

Idem.

—Nature teacheth euer

Who loues preferment, needs muſt loue the giuer.

Th. Storer.

### 1.118. Nobilitie.

If to be noble and hie thy mind be moued,

Conſider well the ground and thy beginning,

For he that hath each ſtarre in heauen fixed,

[[Page 218]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=116)And giues
the moone her hornes and her eclipſing,

Alike hath made the noble in his working:

So that wretched no way mayſt thou bee,

Except foule luſt and vice do conquer thee.

E. of Surrey.

Let each man cracke of that which was his owne,

Our preſent vertues are theirs, and no whit ours:

Who therefore will of noble birth be knowne,

Ought ſhine in vertue like his aunceſtors.

Gentry conſiſteth not in lands and townes,

He is a churle though all the world were his,

Yea Arthurs heire if that he liu'd amis.

M. of M.

Behold of nobles new the diuerſe ſourſe,

Some vertue raiſeth, ſome climbe by ſluttiſh ſorts:

The firſt though onely of themſelues begunne,

Yet circle-wiſe into themſelues do runne,

Within themſelues therefore vnited ſo,

Both endleſſe is, and ſtronger gainſt their foe:

For when ends it that neuer hath begunne?

Or how may that hath not end, be vndone?

The other as by wicked meanes they grew,

And raignd by flatterie, or violence; ſo ſoone rue.

Firſt ſtumbling ſtep from honours old is vice,

Which once ſtept downe, ſome linger, none ariſe

To former Type: but they catch vertues ſpray,

Which raiſeth them that climbe by lawfull way.

Beware to riſe by ſeruing princely luſt,

Surely to ſtand on mean, is riſing iuſt.

M. of M.

[[Page 219]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=116)

The Roſe although in thornie ſhrubs ſhe ſpread,

Is ſtill the Roſe, her bewties waxe not dead.

And noble mindes, although the court be bare,

Are by reſemblance knowne how great they are.

R. Gree [...]e.

A noble minde diſdaineth ſeruitude.

Th. Kyd.

True nobleneſſe neuer doth the thing it ſhould not.

Idem.

The noble heart that harbours vertuous thought,

And is with childe with glories great intent:

Can neuer reſt vntill it forth haue brought

Th'eternall broode of glory excellent.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.119. Old Age.

—Next in order, ſad old Age we found,

His beard all hoare, his eyes hollow and blinde,

With drouping cheere ſtill poaring on the ground

As on the the place where valour him aſſign'd

To reſt, when as the ſiſters had vntwind

His vitall thred, and ended with their knife,

The fleeting courſe of faſt declining life.

M. Sackuill.

Crookt backt he was, tooth-ſhaken and bleare eide,

Went on three feete, and ſometime crept on foure,

With old lame bones that ratled by his ſide,

His ſcalpe all pild, and he with eld forlore,

His withered fiſt ſtill knocking at deaths dore,

Fumbling and driueling as he drawes his breath,

In breefe, the ſhape and meſſenger of death.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

[[Page 220]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=117)

Old age and winter do accord full nie,

This chill, that cold, this crooked, that awrie.

Ed. Spencer.

—He that plies the laps and lips of Ladies all his time,

And fals to arms when age fails arms, then alſo looſeth time:

As if a beare in Moone-ſhine, ſhuld attempt the Moone to clime.

W· VVarner.

Our infancie is feeble, and our luſtie youth vnstaid,

Our manhood carking, and our age more loathed then obaid.

Idem.

Our heires wax ſickiſh of our health, too long our here abode

Mean while the nerer to our graues, the farther we frō God

Gripple in works, teſtie in words, loathſom for moſt at lēgth,

And ſuch at foure ſcore, as at foure, for maners wit and ſtrength.

Idem.

Eld is ordaind to counſell, youth to fight,

Age to foreſee, yoong courage to inact.

D. Lodge.

Skill and experience good companions beene,

Age knoweth whatſoeuet youth hath ſeene.

S. I. H.

Decrepit age and hoary ſiluer haires,

Still craueth helpe of luſtie youthfull yeares.

G. Gaſcoigne·

It is a common point whereon the aged groſly runne,

Once to haue dared ſaid, & ſeene, more then was euer done.

W. Warner.

—The equall age doth equall life deſire.

S. Daniel.

Small drops God knowes do quench age heatleſſe fire,

When all the ſtrength is onely in deſire.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 221]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=117)

### 1.120. Opinion.

O male-content ſeducing ghueſt,

Contriuer of our greateſt woes:

Which borne of winde and fed with ſhowes,

Doſt nurſe thy ſelfe in thine vnreſt,

Iudging vngotten things the beſt,

Or what thou in conceit deſigneſt.

S. Daniell.

Thou all things in the world doſt deeme,

Not as they are, but as they ſeeme,

Idem.

Thou ſoule of pleaſure, houres onely ſubſtance,

Great arbitrator, vmpire of the earth,

Whom fleſhly Epicures call vertues eſſence

Thou mouing Orator, whoſe powerfull breath

Swaies all mens iudgements, Great Opinion,

I. Marston.

Opinion is as various as light chaunge,

Now ſpeaking courtlike friendly, ſtraight as ſtrange.

Shee's any humours perfect paraſite,

Diſpleaſd with her, and pleaſd with her delight.

Shee is the Eccho of inconſtancie,

Soothing her no with nay, her I with yea.

E. Guilpin.

This ſyren or Opinion, wind-borne lame,

Seeking to eaſe vs, brings vs to vnreſt:

For it adiudgeth nothing it doth ſee,

By what it is, but what it ſeemes bee.

I. Markham.

We muſt in matters morall, quite reiect

Vulgar Opinion, euer led amiſſe:

[[Page 222]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=118)And let
autenticke reaſon be our guide,

The wife of truth, and wiſedomes gouerneſſe.

G. Chapman.

### 1.121. Opportunitie.

Opportunitie thy guilt is great,

Tis thou that execut'ſt the traitors treaſon,

Thou ſetſt the wolfe where he the lambe may get,

Who euer plots the ſinne, thou points the ſeaſon.

Tis thou that ſpurn'ſt at right, at lawiers reaſon:

And in thy ſhady Cell where none may ſpie him,

Sits ſinne, to feare each ſoule that wanders by him.

W. Shakespeare.

Faire Opportunitie can winne the coyeſt ſhe that is,

Then he that rules her gameſome vaine, & tēpers toies with art,

Brings loue that ſwimmeth in her eyes, to diue into her hart.

W. Warner.

When loue hath knit two parts in perfect vnitie,

They ſeldome faile to finde th'opportunitie.

S. I. Harrington.

### 1.122. Occaſion.

Occaſion's wingd, and euer flyeth faſt,

Comming ſhe ſmiles, and frownes once being paſt.

M. Drayton.

Now by the forehead let vs take Occaſion,

Leaſt after all our trauell and expence,

He hide away his haire, and turne his balld,

And we vnprouident bethought and calld.

S. I. H.

[[Page 223]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=118)

If luſt or age doth minde aſſaile,

Subdue Occaſion, ſo thou ſhalt preuaile.

Idem.

True iudgement ſleight regards Opinion.

I. Marston.

Opinion how doſt thou moleſt

Th'affected mind of reſtleſſ man?

Who following thee neuer can,

Nor euer ſhall attaine to reſt,

Forgetting what thou ſaiſt is beſt,

Yet loe, that beſt he findes farre wide,

Of what thou promiſeſt before,

For in the ſame he look't for more,

Which proues but ſmall when once is tried.

S. Daniell.

He onely treads the ſure and perfect path

To greatneſſe, who loue and opinion hath.

Idem.

Let vs eſteeme Opinion as ſhe is

Fooles bable, Innouations miſtris.

The Proteus Robin good fellow of change,

Smithfield of iaded fancies, and th'exchange

Of fleeting cenſures, nurſe of hereſie,

Begot by nature on inconſtancie,

Its but the kiſſe of griefe, the peoples noiſe,

The tongue of humors and fantaſtick voice,

Of haire braind apprehenſion it reſpects

With all due titles, and that due neglects

Euen in one inſtant.

Ed. Guilpin.

### 1.123. Patience.

Patience doth beare a neuer pierced ſheeld,

Whoſe brightneſſe hath enforc'r more monſters yeeld,

Then that of vgly Gorgons head was made.

I. Syluister.

Patience is angers ſubiect, and controll'd

With euery fury, which men would redreſſe,

But cannot do it, for ſhe is gentle milde,

Orecome and kept downe like a ſtrengthleſſe childe.

Ch. Middleton.

Patience a praiſe, forbearance is a treaſure,

Sufferance an angell, a monſter rage.

Ed. Fairfax.

Let gentle Patience profit thee, for Patience is a thing,

Whereby a begger gaineth of a diſcontented King.

Ʋ Ʋ. Warner.

Man in himſelfe a litle world doth beare,

His ſoule the Monarch euer ruling there,

Where euer then his body do remaine,

He is a King that in himſelfe doth raigne,

And neuer feareth fortunes hot'ſt alarmes,

That beares againſt her Patience for her armes.

M. Drayton.

The leſſer pangs can beare, who hath endur'd the chief.

Ed. Sp.

What fortune hurts, let Patience onely heale,

No wiſedome with extremities to deale.

M. Dr.

By patient ſufferance could we mildly beare

With fortune, yet we equally might ſhare,

And ouercomming that which all do feare.

[[Page 225]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=119)By preſent
cure, preuent enſuing care.

Idem.

Who in diſtreſſe from reſolution flies,

Is rightly ſaid to yeeld to miſeries.

That life is only miſerable and vile,

From which faire Patience doth it ſelfe exile.

Idem.

Though eyes want ſight of that they would ſee faine,

The thought yet ſees, and heart with patience likes it:

Long abſence greeues thee when they meet againe,

Abſence delights, and doth more pleaſant make it

To ſerue and ſue long time for little gaine.

(So that all hope do not quite forſake it)

One may endure, for when the paine is paſt

Reward though long it ſtaie, yet comes at laſt.

S. I. H.

Let Brontes and blacke Steropes

Sweat at the Forge their hammers beating:

An houre will come, they muſt affect their eaſe,

Though but while mettall's heating.

And after all their Aetnean ire,

"Gold that is perfect will out-liue the fire.

"For Fury waſteth,

"As Patiend laſteth.

"No armor to the Mind: "He is ſhoot-fire

From Iniury,

That is not hurt; not hee, that is not hit:

So Fooles we ſee,

Oft ſcape their Imputation, more through luck, then wit.

B. Iohnſon.

### 1.124. Paſsion.

Paſſion deuours, but time digeſts our woe.

[[Page 226]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=120)Paſſion
beares hie, when puffing witts do blowe:

But is indeed a to [...], if not a toy,

True cauſe of euils, and cauſe of cauſed th ſhowe.

S. Phil. Sid

They only apteſt are for to reueale

Their priuate paſsions who the ſame do feele.

D. Lodge.

None doth liue not paſſionate of loue, ire, mirth or griefe.

W. VVarner.

A man may not of paſsions iudge aright,

Except his mind be from all paſsions free:

Nor can a Iudge his office well acquite,

If he poſſeſt of either partie bee.

I. Dauies.

### 1.125. Parents.

It is as common as vnkind a fault

In youth (too ſubiect to this worlds aſſault)

To imitate, admit, and daily chuſe

Thoſe errors which their lawleſſe parents vſe.

D. Lodge.

If damned dice the father doth affect,

The ſelfe-like folly doth his heire infect.

If luſt, to luſt the ſonne is to procliue,

If fraud, by fraud his wanton race will thriue.

If ſurfit, ſurfit is eſteem'd no ſin,

For youth perſeuers as he doth begin.

Idem.

—From damned deeds abſtaine,

From lawleſſe riots and from pleaſures vaine.

If not regarding of thy owne degree,

[[Page 227]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=120)Yet in
behalfe of thy poſteritie,

For we are docible to imitate

Depraued pleaſures, though degenerate.

Be carefull therefore leaſt thy ſonne admit

By eare or eye things filthy or vnfit.

Idem.

The Babe is bleſt that godly parent [...] bred,

And ſharpe-ſweet tutors traine in louing dred:

But chiefly that (in tender cradle bed)

With ſincere milke of pietie is fed.

I. Syl.

—Charitable, godly, wiſe and continent were fit

Should parents be; ſo proſper they, theirs, and whom they beget.

W. Warner.

—Oft we ſee men ſo fond and blinde

To carry to their ſonnes too much affection:

That when they ſeeme to loue they are vnkinde,

For they do hate a childe that ſpare correction.

S. I. H.

—Parents thoughts in loue, oft ſteppe awry.

G. Peele.

Our parents age worſe then our graund-ſyres bee,

We worſe, beget our children worſe then wee.

Th. Storer.

### 1.126. Peace.

—Mother of the liuing, ſecond nature

Of th'elements, fire, water, earth and aire:

The grace whereby men clime the heauenly chaire,

Whence voyd, this world harbors no happie creature.

Piller of lawes, religions pedeſtall,

Hope of the glory, glory of the immortall.

Honor of cities, pearle of kingdomes all,

[[Page 228]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=121)The nurſe
of vertues, Muſes chiefe ſupportall.

Patron of arts, of good the ſpeciall ſpring.

I. Sylueſter.

Heauens ſacred nymph, faire goddeſſe that renueſt

The golden age, and brightly now reveweſt,

Our cloudy skie, making our fields to ſmile,

Hope of the vertuous, horror of the vile.

Virgin vnſeene, in France this many a yeare,

O bleſſed peace, we bid thee welcome heere.

Idem.

O holy peace by thee are only found,

The paſſing ioyes that euery where abound.

G. Gaſcoigne. Tranſl.

—Moſt ſacred peace

Doth nouriſh vertue, and faſt friendſhip breeds,

Weak ſhe makes ſtrong, & ſtrong things does increaſe:

Till it the pitch of higheſt praiſe exceeds.

Braue be her warres, and honorable deeds,

By which ſhe tryumphs ouer ire and pride,

And wins an Oliue garland for their meeds.

Ed. Spencer.

Peace doth depend on reaſon, warre on force,

The one is humane, honeſt and vpright:

The other brutiſh, foſtered by deſpight.

The one extreame, concluded with remorſe,

The other all iniuſtice doth diuorce.

D. Lodge.

Peace brings in pleaſure, pleaſure breeds exceſſe,

Exceſſe procureth want, want worſe diſtreſſe.

Diſtreſſe contempt, contempt is not repaired,

Till liueleſſe death determine hope diſpaired.

Idem.

Warres greaeſt woes, and miſeries increaſe,

[[Page 229]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=121)Flowes
frō the ſurfets which we take in peace.

B. Iohn.

### 1.127. Pleaſure.

Phyſche in ſtedfaſt loue and happie ſtate

With Cupid liues, and hath him borne a childe,

Pleaſure that doth both Gods and men aggrate.

Ed. Spencer.

Moſt eaſie is the way and paſſage plaine,

To Pleaſures pallace; it may ſoone be ſpide,

And day and night her doores to all ſtand open wide.

Idem.

Her face was wan, a leane and withered skin,

Her ſtature ſcant three horſloaues did exceed:

Her haire was gray of hue, and very thin,

Her teeth were gone, her gummes ſeru'd in their ſteed.

No ſpace there was betweene her noſe and chin.

Her noyſome breath contagion would breed.

In fine, of her it might haue well bene ſaid,

In Nestors youth ſhe was a prettie maid.

S. I. Harr.

O poyſoned hooke that lurkes in ſugred bait

O Pleaſures vaine, that in this world are found:

Which like a ſubtill theefe do lie in wait

To ſwallow man in ſinke of ſin profound.

Idem.

—Reuels, daunces, maskes and merry howers,

Forerun faire loue, ſtrowing her way with flowers.

W. Sha.

O Pleaſure thou the very lure of ſin,

The roote of woe, our youths deceitfull guide:

A ſhop where all infected perſons bin,

The bait of luſt, the inſtrument of pride.

[[Page
230]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=122)Inchaunting
Circes ſmoothing couert guile,

Alluring Syren, flattering Crocodile.

M. Drayton.

Pleaſures be poore, and our delights be dead,

When as a man doth not enioy the head.

Idem.

Neuer haue vniuſt pleaſures bene compleat

In ioyes intire; but ſtill feare kept the dore:

And held backe ſomething from that hell of ſweet,

To inter ſowre vnſure delights the more.

For neuer did all circumſtances meet

With thoſe deſires which were conceiu'd before.

Something muſt ſtill be left to cheare our ſin,

And giue a touch of what ſhould not haue bin.

S. Daniell.

Pleaſure is felt, opinion but conceiu'd.

Idem.

In feare her arts are learned now a daies,

To counterfait their haire and paint their skin:

But reaſons ring their craft and guile bewraies,

No wiſe men of their paintings paſſe a pin.

S. I. H.

Too much deſire to pleaſe, pleaſure diuorces,

Attempts, and not intreat, get Ladies larges.

G. Chapman.

Our fond preferments are but childrens toyes,

And as a ſhadow all our pleaſures paſſe:

As yeares increaſe, ſo waining are our ioyes,

And beautie crazed like a broken glaſſe,

A prettie tale of that which neuer was.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 231]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=122)

—Pleaſures neuer dine but on exceſſe,

Whoſe diet made to draw on all delight:

And ouercome in that ſweet drunkenneſſe,

His appetite maintained by his ſight,

Strengtheneth deſire, but euer weakeneth might.

Vntill this vlcer ripening to an head,

Vomits the poyſon which it nouriſhed.

Idem.

Short houres worke long effects minutes haue change,

While pleaſure ioyeth, paine more ripe doth growe.

Idem.

The ſecret ſweet is ſweeteſt, ſweet to fall.

Th. Achilley.

—To them that know not pleaſures price,

Alls one, a priſon, or a paradice.

M. Drayton.

### 1.128. Poeſie.

All art is learnd by art, this art alone

It is a heauenly gift: no fleſh nor bone

Can preiſe the hony we from Pind diſtill,

Except with holy fier his breſt we fill.

From that ſpring flowes, that men of ſpeciall chooſe

Conſum'd in learning and perfit in proſe:

For to make verſe in vaine do is trauell take,

When as a prentiſe fairer words will make.

K. of S.

Whilome in ages paſt none might profeſſe

But princes and hie prieſts that ſacred skill:

The ſacred lawes wherein they wont expreſſe,

And with deepe oracles their verſes fill,

Then was he held in ſoueraigne dignitie,

[[Page 232]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=123)And made
the nourſling of nobilitie.

But now nor Prince nor Prieſt doth her maintaine,

But ſuffer her prophaned for to bee,

Of the baſe vulgar that with hands vncleane

Dares to pollute her hidden miſterie.

And treadeth vnderfoote her holy things,

Which was the care of Keyſars and of Kings.

Ed. Spencer.

Thoſe numbers wherwith heauen & earth are mou'd,

Shew, weaknes ſpeaks in proſe, but power in verſe.

S. Daniell.

—Man from man muſt holy parted bee,

If with his age his verſe do well agree.

Amongſt our hands, he muſt his wits reſing,

A holy traunce to higheſt heauen him bring.

For euen as humane fury makes the man

Leſſe then the man: ſo heauenly fury can

Make man paſſe man, and wander in holy miſt

Vpon the fiery heauen to walke at liſt.

Within that place the heauenly Poets ſought

Their learning, ſin to vs here downe it brought.

With verſe that ought to Atropos no due,

Dame Natures trunchmen, heauens interpret true,

K. of Scots.

The vaunted verſe a vacant head demaunds,

Ne wont with crabbed care the Muſes dwell,

Vnwiſely weaues that takes two webbes in hand.

Ed. Spencer.

O peerleſſe Poeſie, where is then thy place?

If not in princes pallace thou doeſt ſit,

And yet is princes pallace the moſt fit.

[[Page 233]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=123)Or breach
of baſer birth doth thee embrace,

Then make thee wings of thy aſpiring wit,

And whence thou cam'ſt fly backe to heauen apace.

Idem.

All art is learn'd by art, but poeſie

It is a gift diuine, and cannot die.

Idem.

Like as into the waxe the ſeales imprent,

Is like a ſeale: right ſo the Poet gent,

Doth graue ſo viue in vs his paſſions ſtrange,

As makes the reader halfe in author change,

For Verſes force is like that ſoftly ſlides,

Through ſecret poris, and in our ſences bides,

As make them haue both good and ill imprented,

Which by the learned worke is repreſented.

K. of Scots.

— Onely he of Lawrell is condigne,

Who wiſely can with profit pleaſure minge,

The faireſt walking on the ſea coaſt beene,

And ſureſt ſwimming where the braes are greene,

So wiſe is he who in his verſe can haue

Skill mixt with pleaſure ſports, with doctrine graue.

Idem.

Who euer caſts to compaſſe waightie priſe,

And thinks to throw out thundering words of threat:

Let power in lauiſh cups and thriftie bits of meat,

For Bacchus fruite is friend to Phoebus wiſe,

And when with wine the braine begins to ſweat,

The numbers flowe, as freely ſpring doth riſe.

Ed. Spencer.

Ridled poeſies and thoſe ſignificantly flowe,

Differ in eares, as do in mouths the apricocke and ſloe.

W. Warner.

[[Page 234]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=124)

What reaſon mou'd the golden Augustine

To name our Poetrie vaine errors wine?

Or Hierome deeply ſighted in their euills,

To tearme it nothing but the foode of deuils.

Nought but the miſimployment of our gifts,

Ordaind for Art, but ſpent in ſhamleſſe ſlufts.

D. Lodge.

Looke as the ſun-beame in a burning glaſſe,

Doth kindle fier where euer it doth paſſe,

But freely ſpread vpon th'engendring earth,

Egges on the ſpring, and bils the cauſe of dearth,

So Poeſie reſtraind in errors bounds,

With poiſoned words and ſinfull ſweetneſſe wounds,

But cloathing vertue and adorning it,

Wit ſhines in vertue, vertue ſhines in it.

Idem.

### 1.129. Poets.

The Greekes do paint the Poets office whole,

In Pegaſus their fained horſe, with wings,

Whom ſhaped ſo, Meduſaes bloud did foyle,

Who with his feete ſtrake out the Muſes ſprings

Fro flintie rocks to Helicon that clings,

And then flew vp into the ſtarry skie,

And thete abides among the Gods on hie:

For who that will a perfect Poet bee,

He muſt be bred out of Meduſaes blood,

He muſt be chaſte and vertuous as was ſhee,

Who to her power, the Ocean God withſtood.

To th'end alſo his doombe be iuſt and good,

He muſt as ſhe, looke rightly with one eie,

[[Page 235]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=124)Truth to
regard, ne write one thing awrie.

In courage eke, he muſt be like a horſe,

He may not feare to regiſter the right.

What though ſome frowne? thereof he may not force

No bit, ne raine his tender iawes may twight,

He muſt be arm'd with ſtrength of wit and ſprite,

To daſh the rocks, darke cauſes and obſcure,

Till he attaine the ſprings of truth moſt pure.

His houes alſo muſt pliant be and ſtrong,

To riue the rocks of luſt and errors blind.

In braineleſſe heads that alwaies wander wrong,

Theſe muſt be bruis'd with reaſons plaine and kind,

Till ſprings of grace do guſh out of thy mind:

For till affections fond be from thee driuen,

In vaine is truth told, or good counſell giuen.

Like Pegaſus, a Poet muſt haue wings,

To flie to heauen, or where him liketh beſt,

He muſt haue knowledge of eternall things,

Almightie Ioue muſt harbour in his breſt,

With worldly cares he may not be oppreſt.

The wings of wit and skill muſt heaue him hier,

With great delight to ratifie deſier.

He muſt alſo be luſtie, free, and ſwift,

To trauell farre to view the trades of men.

Great knowledge oft is gotten by the ſhift,

Things that import he muſt be quicke to pen,

Reprouing vices ſharply now and then.

He muſt be ſwift when touched tyrants chafe,

To gallope thence, to keepe his carkas ſafe.

M. of M.

[[Page 236]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=125)

A Poet muſt be pleaſant, not too plaine,

Faults to controll, ne yet to flatter vice,

But ſound and ſweete, in all things ware and wiſe.

Idem.

—Poets onely pride,

Is vertue to aduance, and vice deride.

Ed. Spencer.

—Poets right are like the pipe alway,

Who full doth ſound, and emptie, ſtaies to play:

Euen ſo their fury laſting, laſts their tone,

Their fury ceaſt, their muſe doth ſtay anone.

K. of Scots.

When heauen would ſtriue to doo the beſt ſhe can,

And put an Angels ſpirit into a man,

Then all her powers ſhe in that worke doth ſpend,

When ſhe a Poet to the world doth ſend.

The difference onely twixt the Gods and vs,

Allowd by them, is but diſtinguiſht thus.

They giue men breath, men by their powers are born,

That life they giue, the Poet doth adorne:

And from the world when they diſſolue mans breath,

They in the world do giue man life in death.

M. Drayton.

—Who ſo will with vertues deeds aſſay

To mount to heauen on Pegaſus muſt ride,

And with ſweete Poets verſe be glorifide,

For not to haue bene dipt in Laethe Lake,

Could ſaue the ſonne of Thetis for to die,

But that blind bard did him immortall make,

With Verſes dipt, in deaw of Castelie,

Which made the Eaſterne Emperour to crie.

O fortunate yoong man whoſe vertue found

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=125)So braue a
trumpe thy vertues to reſound.

Ed. Spencer.

Phiſitions bills not patients but Apothecaries knowes,

Some moderne Poets be hardly inward ſo,

Not intellectually to write, is learnedly they trowe,

Whereby they hit capacities, as blind men hit the crowe.

W. Warner.

As now by melancholy walks, and thredbare coats we geſſe,

At clients and at Poets none worke more, and profit leſſe.

None make to more vnmade of more, the good of other men

For thoſe enrich the gowniſts, theſe eternize with their pen.

Yet ſoothly nods to Poets now, are largeſſe and but loſt,

For Pallas hermits liue ſecure, obſcure in roofes emboſt.

Idem.

The world and they ſo ill according bee,

That wealth and Poets hardly can agree:

Fewe liue in court, that of their good do care,

The muſes friends are euery where ſo rare.

M. Draiton.

He giues a Poet that his verſes heares.

Idem.

But oh Mecenas is yclad in clay,

And great Augustus long ago is dead,

And all the worthies liggen wrapt in lead,

That matter made for Poets on to play

[...]or euer, who in dorring do, were dead,

The loftie verſe of them was loued aye:

But after vertue, gan for age to ſtoupe,

And mightie manhood brought to bed of eaſe,

[...]he vaunting Poets found nought worth a peaſe,

[...]o put in preaze among the learned troope,

[...]ho gan the ſtreames of flowing wits to ceaſe,

[[Page 238]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=126)And ſun-
bright honour pend in ſhamefull coope.

Ed. Spencer.

—Theſe frugall patrons who begin

To ſcantle learning with a ſeruile pay,

Make Poets thinke their negligence no ſin,

The cold conceit of recompence doth flay,

Their fiery furie when they ſhould begin,

The Prieſt vnpaid, can neither ſing nor ſay,

Nor Poets ſweetly write, except they meete

With ſome rewards for ſermoning ſo ſweete.

D. Lodge.

— Platoes Common-weale did packe

None of thoſe Poets, who by Verſe did make

The good men euill, and the wicked worſe,

Whoſe pleaſant words betraid the publike corſe,

Nor thoſe who in their ſongs good termes, alwaies

Ioynd with faire theames: whil'ſt thundring on the praiſe

Of God, iuſt thunderer; whiles this holy ſpeach,

Like Hermes did the way to ſtrayers teach.

K. of Scots.

### 1.130. Plentie.

— Such is th'ffect of two much ſtore,

It makes them loathe that which they lou'd before.

Ch. Middleton.

The ſtately Eagle on his pitch doth ſtand

And from the maine the fearefull foule doth ſuit,

Yet ſcornes to touch them lying on the land,

When he hath felt the ſweete of his delight,

But leaues the ſame a pray to euery Kite,

With much we ſurfet, Plentie makes vs poore,

[[Page 239]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=126)The
wretched Indian ſcornes the golden Oare.

M. Drayton.

### 1.131. Pollicie.

O pollicie ſcarce knowne in times that's paſt,

Or being knowne, yet leaſt of moſt eſteemd,

Thy prouidence moſt worthily ſhall laſt,

And in theſe latter dayes be better deemd.

L. Markham.

— Warre, honour doth deſerue,

Yet counſell in all Kingdomes pollicied,

Is farre more worthy and more dignified:

For armes but in extreames do neuer ſerue,

To reconcile and puniſh ſuch as ſwerue.

D. Lodge.

He that will gaine what pollicie doth heed,

By Mercurie muſt deale, or neuer ſpeed.

M. Drayton.

Grounded aduice in daunger ſeldome trips

The deadlieſt poyſon ſtill can ſafely drinke:

Foreſight, ſtands faſt where giddie raſhnes ſlides,

Wiſedome ſeemes blind, when eyed as a Lin [...]

Preuention ſpeaketh ill, but what he thinkes,

The deadlieſt hate which ſmiles ſecurely ſtands.

Idem.

— Pollicie religious habit weares.

Idem.

No Pollicie to ſilence now adaies.

Th. Storer.

Our troubles kept abroad, although to coſt,

A [...]e well bought out, for leaſt by them is loſt.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 240]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=127)

Tis better farre thy enemy to aband

Quite from thy bowers to a ſtranger ſoyle,

Then he at home thee and thy country foyle.

M. of M.

The head that deemes to ouertop the skie,

Shall periſh in his humane pollicie.

R. Greene.

How oft haue watching pollicie deuizde

A cunning clauſe which hath himſelfe ſurprizde?

How often hath leaud fraud bene ſet a flore

Of purpoſe that his goods might cut his throte?

Who builds on ſtrength by pollicie is ſtript,

Who hurts his wit by wit, is ſooneſt tript.

D. Lodge.

Endeuours polliticke take ſmall effect,

That wants aſſiſtance from the heauenly word:

Beſide fome helpe muſt wealth and ſtate afford.

For iudgement vttered by the mouth of want,

Is either partiall or admired ſcant.

Th. Storer.

A Clergie man his calling much impaires,

To meddle with the polliticke affaires.

Idem.

Though Marius could begin and make the fray,

Yet Scaurus pollicie deſerues the baye.

D. Lodge.

Let Catulus with Pompey be comparde,

Or wittie Cicero with Cateline:

And to preuent with pollicie diuine,

That which the other ouer-raſhly darde,

Deſerues ſuch fame as may not be imparde.

Idem.

[[Page 241]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=127)

Say military vertues do require

A valiant heart, great ſtrength and conſtancie:

The ſelfe like gifts in ciuil pollicie,

Are requiſite for ſuch as do aſpire

To gaine renowne by counſell for their hire.

Idem.

A little harme done to a great good end,

For lawfull pollicie remaines inacted,

The poyſonous ſimple ſometime is compacted

In a pure compound; being ſo applied

His venome in effect is purified.

W. Sha.

### 1.132. Pouertie.

O pouertie, chiefe of the heauenly broode.

Ed. Fairfax.

—Such is the world, this croſ-blis world of ours,

That vertue hardly hides her ſelf in poore & deſart bowers,

And ſuch be beſt as ſeeme not beſt, content exceeds a crowne

VV. Warner.

—Powerfull need (arts auncient dame, and keeper)

The early watch clocke of the ſlothfull ſleeper.

I. Sylueſter.

—Lacke is thrall and ſlaue to euery thing.

Th. Churchyard.

Need is miſtreſſe of all exerciſe.

Th. Baſtard.

A ſchollers want exceeds a clownes content.

Idem.

No danger but in hie eſtate, none erre in meane degree.

W. Warner.

[[Page 242]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=128)

—Where imperious need doth tyrannize,

The holy heate through worldly cares doth pawſe

Its ſoild with earthly thoughts and downward drawes.

Hence come thoſe dull conceits among the wiſe,

Which coy eard readers cenſure to proceed

From ignorance, whereas they grow by need.

D. Lodge.

The citizens like ponned pikes, the leſſer feeds the great,

The rich for meat ſeek ſtomachs, and the pore for ſtomach meat.

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

Be as thou art, not as thou wouldſt, it will be as it is,

Learne then to lack, and learn to liue, for croſſes neuer miſſe.

Idem.

### 1.133. Prayer.

Prayers heart and ſides, and feet, are full of wings

(Like to th'Arcadian which Ioues arrand brings)

Her body burning, from her lips doth come

The ſmoake of Incenſe, and of ſweet Amome.

I. Sylueſter.

Heauens are propitious vnto fearfull prayers.

R. Greene.

Faſting (though faint) her face with ioy ſhe cheares,

In weaknes ſtrong, and young in aged yeares.

Quicke health preſeruer, curbing Cupids fits,

Watchfull, purge humors, and refining wits.

I. Syl.

### 1.134. Praiſe.

This falſe painted deitie called Laude,

Which makes vs thirſt for vaine eternitie:

Twixt our deſires and hope, a cunning baud

[[Page 243]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=128)Vſhers the
ſoule vnto extremitie:

And helpt by ſlye inſinuating fraud,

Couers her deeds in ſcrowles of pietie.

I. Markham.

The hope of praiſe makes men no trauell ſhunne,

To ſay an other day this haue we donne.

S. I. H.

Who rightly climes the top of endleſſe praiſe,

Regards not what the wiſe diſcourſer ſaies.

Th. Storer.

—From praiſe takes enuie cauſe.

W. W.

The chiefeſt praiſe is to imbrace the man

In wealth and woe, with whom our loue began.

G. Turb.

The greateſt praiſe, in greateſt perils wonne.

Ed. Fairfax.

The looſer wantons ſild are praiſde of many,

Vice oft findes friends but vertue ſildome any.

M. Dray.

In Athence where Themiſtocles remaind,

Though much he conquered by his regiments,

Yet Solon was more praiſed for his intents.

D. Lodge.

Praiſe not the bewty of thy wife, though ſhe of fame be ſpred,

For Gyges moued ſo, did graft on Caudales his hed.

VV. Warner.

### 1.135. Prouidence.

O Prouidence the conduct to our life,

The ground of vertue, hoſtile foe to ſin:

That re [...]eſt Towers, and appeaſeſt ſtrife:

[[Page 244]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=129)Thou
gathereſt all diſpearſed exiles in.

Thou that inuenteſt lawes gainſt man and wife.

Thou miſtreſſe vnto auncient diſcipline.

Thou that bear'ſt heauen and nature round about thee:

That makeſt all things, nothing being without thee.

I. Markham.

### 1.136. Pride.

Of griſly Pluto ſhe the daughter was,

And ſad Proſerpina the queene of hell:

Yet doth ſhe thinke her peerleſſe worth to paſſe,

That parentage with pride ſo doth ſhe ſwell,

And thundering Ioue that high in heauen doth dwell:

And weeld the world, ſhe claimed for her ſire.

Or if that any els doth Ioue excell,

For to the higheſt ſhe doth ſtill aſpire,

Or if ought higher were, then that doth it deſire.

—And proud Lucifera men did her call.

Ed. Spencer.

O pride, the ſhelfe cloſe ſhrowded in the port

Of this lifes Ocean, drowning all reſort.

D. Lodge.

Pride makes her rownds, for ſhe hath neuer end,

And ſonnets, for ſhe neuer leaues her noyſe:

She makes her dumps if any thing offend,

And to her Idoll-ſelfe with warbling voyce

Sings Hymnes and Anthems of eſpeciall choyce.

And yet prides quiuer's put to ſilence cleane,

Wanting a baſe, a tenor, and a meane.

Th. Storer.

[[Page 245]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=129)

The winged giant loftie ſtaring pride,

That in the cloudes her brauing breſt doth hide.

I. Syl.

Pride is the roote of ill in euery ſtate,

The ſourſe of ſin, the very fiend his fee:

The head of hell, the bough, the braunch, the tree.

From which do ſpring and ſprout ſuch fleſhly ſeeds,

As nothing els but moane and miſchiefe breeds.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Pride drawes on vengeance, vengeance hath no mean.

—Nemeſis hath euery howre reſeru'd

A plague for pride that hath from iuſtice ſweru'd.

D. Lodge.

—Such is the nature ſtill of hautie pride,

Can nothing leſſe then others praiſe abide.

M. of M.

—When once pride but pointeth toward his fall.

He beares a ſword to wound himſelfe withall.

M. Drayton.

—Loftie pride that dwells

In towred courts, is oft in ſhepheards cells.

Ch. Marlowe.

A proud man may his owne muſition bee,

His heads deuiſe makes pauins to his hart:

This heart with lippes and pleaſures daunceth free,

All but the meaſures framing euery part

Like organis worthy of ſo ſweet an art.

His thoughts plaies marches to his vaulting minde,

And memorie his Recorder ſtands behinde.

Th. Storer.

Gay without good, is good hearts greateſt loathing.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 246]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=130)

### 1.137. Princes.

The very place wherein a Prince appeares

Diſcernes his preſence, makes his chamber bleſt:

Like Planets are they knowne within their ſpheares,

Or as Halcion with her luring breſt:

Demonſtrates winde from winde, and Eaſt from Weſt.

This is a certaine nature of eſtate,

It cannot masked be, nor chaunge his gate.

Th. Storer.

A Princes ſafetie lies in louing people,

His fort is Iuſtice (free from ſtratageme)

Without the which ſtrong citadels are feeble,

The ſubiects loue is wonne by louing them.

Of louing them no oppreſſion is the tryall,

And no oppreſſion makes them euer loyall.

I. Syl.

To be a Prince, is more then be a man.

S. Daniell.

—Princes are the glaſſe, the ſchoole, the booke

vvhere ſubiects eies do liue, do read, do looke.

vv. vvarner.

Howbeit ſubiects falſly iudge their Princes bleſſed are,

vvhen both of peace & perils they contain the common care.

And yet for this they grudgingly from pounds a penny ſpare.

Idem.

Princes in ſubiects wrōgs muſt deem themſelues abuſd

S. Phil. Sidney.

Priuate men ſound not the hearts of Princes,

Whoſe actions oft beare contrary pretences.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 247]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=130)

Princes like Lyons neuer will be tamde,

A priuate man may yeeld and care not howe,

But greater hearts will breake before they bowe.

Idem.

The Princes armes are ſtretcht from ſhore to ſhore.

M. Drayton.

—As the pawnce doth circle with the Sunne,

So to the vice, or vertue of the Prince, are people wonne.

W. Warner.

Good Princes ſorrow more in puniſhing,

Then euil ſubiects in committing ſin.

Ch. Mid.

Euen as defaults will more conſpicuous be

How much th'offender greater is eſteemd:

So vertue in a princely body ſeene,

Lamp-like and far more excellently deemd,

That in ſuch vinitie its ſeldome ſeene.

In mutuall approach of higheſt bliſſe,

Whether more graced each by other is.

Th. Storer.

O happie Princes whoſe foreſight and care

Can winne the loue of writers in ſuch ſort

As Caeſars did, ſo as you need not dread

The lake of Laethe after ye be dead.

S. I.H.

—Princes neuer do themſelues more wrong

Then when they hinder iuſtice or prolong.

Idem.

In whoſe high breſt may Iuſtice build her bower

When Princes hearts wide open lye to wrong?

G. Gaſcoigne.

[[Page 248]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=131)

We imitate the greater powers,

The princes manners, faſhion ours:

The example of their light regarding,

Vulgar looſenes much incenſes,

Vice vncontroll'd, growes wide inlarging,

Kings ſmall faults be great offences.

S. Daniell.

Oft for the pleaſure of a prince go many things awry.

VV. Warner.

Princes like ſinnes be euermore in ſight,

Ill ſee the clouds which do eclips their light.

Yet they which light all downe from their skies,

See not the cloudes offending others eies.

And deeme their noonetide is deſirde of all,

When all exſpect cleare changes by their fall.

M. Dray.

Princes haue but their titles for their glories,

An outward honor for an inward toyle:

And for vnfelt imagination

They often feele a world of reſtleſſe cares.

So that betwixt their titles and low names

Their's nothing differs but the outward fame.

W. Sha.

Seld ſhall you ſee the ruine of a prince,

But that the people eke like brunt do beare:

And old records of auncient times long ſince

From age to age, yea almoſt euery where,

With proofe hath glutted euery yeare.

Thus by the follies of the princes hart,

The bounden ſubiect ſtill receiueth ſmart.

G. Gaſcoigne.

[[Page 249]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=131)

### 1.138. Quietneſſe.

The wind is great vpon the higheſt hills,

The quiet life is in the dale below:

Who tread on y [...]e ſhall ſlide againſt their wills,

They want not cares that curious arts would know.

Who liues at eaſe and can content him ſo

Is perfit wiſe, and ſets vs all to ſchoole:

Who hates this lore, may well be call'd a foole.

M. of M.

—Quietnes the onely nurſe or eaſe.

M. Dray.

Wellwot I ſooth they ſay that ſay, more quiet nights and daies.

The ſhepheard ſleeps & wakes, then he whoſe cattell he doth graze▪

VV. Warner.

### 1.139. Reaſon.

—Logicke, reaſon in a daunce

(Reſon the Cynoſure and bright load-ſtarre

In this worlds ſea) t'auoyd the rocke of chaunce,

For vith cloſe following and continuance,

O [...]e reaſon doth another ſo enſue,

A in concluſion ſtill the daunce i [...] true.

I. Dauies.

—Reaſon ſhould haue abilitie

To h [...]ld theſe worldly things in ſuch proportion,

As lethem come or go with euen facilitie.

S. Phil. Sidney.

— [...]uery thing that is begun with reaſon

Will c [...]e by ready meanes vnto his end,

But thi [...]gs miſcounſelled, muſt needs miſwend.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 250]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=132)

Reaſon by prudence in her function,

Had wont to tutor all out action,

Ayding with precepts of Philoſophie

Our feebled natures imbecillitie,

But now affection with concupiſcence,

Haue got ore reaſon chiefe preheminence.

I. Marſton.

What warre ſo cruell, or what ſiege ſo ſore

As that which ſtrong affections do applie

Againſt the fort of reaſon euermore,

To bring the ſoule into captiuitie?

Their force is fairer through infirmitie

Of the fraile fleſh, relenting to their rage,

And exerciſe moſt bitter tirannie,

Vpon the parts brought into their bondage;

No wretchedneſſe is like to ſinfull villanie.

Ed. Spencer.

But in a body which doth freely yeeld

His parts to reaſons rule obedient,

And letteth not that ought the ſcepter weeld,

All happie peace and goodly gouernment.

Is ſetled there in ſure eſtabliſhment.

Idem.

He that is of reaſons skill bereft,

And wants the ſtuffe of wiſedome him to ſtay,

Is like a ſubiect midſt of tempeſt left,

Withouten helme or pilot her to ſway,

Full ſad and dreadfull is that ſhips euent:

So is the man that wante intendment,

Idem.

Reaſon doth teach vs that the care is vaine,

[[Page 251]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=132)For ill
once paſt which cannot turne againe.

Th. vvatſon.

If reaſon bandie with opinion,

Opinion winnes in the concluſion:

For if a man be once opinionate,

Millions of reaſons will extenuate

His forced malice: conference

Cannot aſſwage opinions inſolence.

But let opinion once lay batterie

To reaſons fort, ſhe will turne hereſie

Or ſuperſtition, wily politiſt,

But ſhe will win thoſe rampi [...]es which reſiſt.

Ed. Gilpin.

—Nought can reaſon auaile in heauenly matters.

S. Phil▪ Sid.

She whom ſauns reaſon men haue reaſon hight,

Since firſt in  [...]ire the Lord the aire incloſde:

In aire the ſea, in ſea the earth diſpoſde

Hath with mild faith maintaind continuall fight.

I. Sylueſter.

—The eye of reaſon is with raging ybent.

Ed. Sp.

### 1.140. Religion.

Sacred Religion, mother of forme and feare.

S. Daniell.

O that this power from euerlaſting giuen,

The great alliance made twixt God and vs,

The intelligence that earth doth hold with heauen.

Sacred Religion, O that thou muſt thus

Be made to ſmooth our vniuſt vneuin,

Brought from aboue earths quarrell to diſcuſſe.

[[Page 252]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=133)Muſt men
beguile our ſoules to win our wills,

And make our zeale the furtherer of ills?

Idem.

No one quailes religion more then foundring presbitie,

Each ſ [...]t impugning order, ſaith and doth his infancie.

W. Warner.

What may not miſchiefe of mad man abuſe?

Religions cloake ſome one to vice doth chuſe.

And maketh God protector of his crime,

O monſtrous world, well ought we wiſh thy fine.

M. of M.

—Engliſh men, nay Chriſtian men, not only ſeeme prophane,

But man to man, as beaſt to beaſt hold ciuil duties vaine.

Yea pulpits ſome like pedlers packs yeeld forth as men affect:

And what a Synode ſhould conclude, a ſouter doth correct.

The rude thus boſ [...]ing literature, one ſin begets another

And groſly thogh a ſchiſme, yet hath ech Schiſmatick his brother

Mean while the learned wāt their meed, & none with profit hears,

The tedious dolt whoſe artleſſe tong doth preach to verie eares.

Ʋ Ʋ. VVarner.

—Since pure religion doth inſtall

Learned profeſſors, Prelates of deſerts,

Let them aſpire and reac inſtructed harts

Againſt the baſe beſtowers of church liuings,

That vſe their graunts in tellings, not in giuings.

Th. Storer.

### 1.141. Repentance.

Repentance makes two riuers of her eies,

Her humble face dares ſcant behold the skies:

Her broken breaſt is beaten blew and blacke,

[[Page 253]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=133)Her tender
fleſhis rent wih rugged ſacke,

With ſorrowes ſnowes her hoary waxen head,

With aſhes pale, and duſt is ouerſpread.

I. Syluister.

Repentance, hope, and ſoft humilitie,

Do flanke the wings of faiths triumphant carre,

Idem.

Repentance,

A ſalue, a comfort, and a cordiall,

He that hath her, the keies of heauen hath,

This is the guide, this is the port, the path.

M. Drayton.

O happie they that keepe within their meaſure,

To turne their courſe in time, and ſound retreit,

Before that wit which late Repentance tought,

Were better neuer had then ſo deare bought.

S. I. H.

Sinnes haue their ſalues, repentance can do much.

R. Greene.

—To be penitent for faults, with it a paron beares.

W. W.

Then hope we health when ſinne is left repentantly in hart,

Adde then new life, and we to God, God doth to vs conuart.

Idem.

Yet ſtay thy feete in murders vgly gate,

Ill comes to ſoone, repentance oft too late.

M. Dr,

Their liues no man ſo ſetled in content,

That hath not daily whereof to repent.

D. Lodge.

We ſee what's good, and thereto we conſent,

But yet we chuſe the worſe and ſoone repent.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 254]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=134)

### 1.142. Rest.

—What ſo ſtrong,

But wanting reſt, will alſo want of might?

The ſunne that meaſures heauen all day long,

At night doth bath his ſteeds, th'Ocean waues among.

Ed. Spencer.

Vntroubled night they ſay, giues counſell beſt.

Idem.

Who long hath reſted cannot runne apace,

The fettered horſe is hindmoſt in the chaſe.

### 1.143. Reuenge.

—Next within the entrie of the gate,

Sate fell reuenge, gnaſhing her teeth with ire,

Deuiſing meanes how ſhe may vengeance take,

Neuer in reſt till ſhe haue her deſire.

But frets within ſo farre forth with the fier

Of wreaking flames, that now determines ſhee,

To die by death, or vengd by death to bee.

M. Sackuill.

O fearefull frowning Nemeſis,

Daughter of iuſtice moſt ſeuere,

That art the worlds great arbitreſſe,

And Queene of cauſes raigning heere.

S. Daniell.

Fierce Nemeſis mother of fate and change,

Sword bearer of th'eternall prouidence.

Idem.

— Nemeſis whoſe haſtie reuenging

Hands are euer at hand: whoſe mind is mutable alwaies,

At miſeries laughing, at mens felicitie grudging.

A. Fraunce.

[[Page 255]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=134)

—Nemeſis hie miſtris of reuenge,

That with the ſcourge keepes all the world in awe.

Th. Dekkar.

The minde by wrong is made a male-content,

And cloudes her ſhine in pleaſleſſe melancholy,

Her holy humours are in paſſion ſpent,

Till by reuenge ſhee's ſet at libertie.

For tis reuenge that ſatisfaction brings

To iniur'd mindes, and to oppreſſed things.

I. Markham.

The ſoule is like a boyſtrous working ſea,

Swelling in billowes for diſdaine of wrongs,

And tumbling vp and downe from bay to bay,

Proues great with child of indignations.

Yet with reuenge is brought to calme allay,

Disburdend of the paine thereto belongs.

Her bowers are turnd to bright-fac't ſun-ſhine braues,

And faire content plaies gently on her waues.

Idem.

Reuenge dies not, rigour begets new wrath,

And bloud hath neuer glory, mercie hath.

S. D.

Reuenge is mine, ſaith he that ſits on hie.

Th. Achelly.

O dire reuenge when thou in time art rakte,

From out the aſhes that preſerue thee long,

And lightly from thy cinders art awakte,

Fuell to freedome, and reuiu'd with wrong:

How ſoone from ſparks the greateſt flames art ſprung?

Which doth by nature to his top aſpire,

Whoſe maſſy greatnes once kept downe his fier.

M. Drayton.

Reuenge in tears doth euer waſh his hands,

Idem.

[[Page 256]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=135)

Who ſo doth threat meanes of reuenge doth looſe.

S. D.

Had I reuenged bene of euery harme,

My coate had neuer kept me halfe ſo warme.

G. Gaſcoigne.

Though vengeance come behind, and her foote ſore,

She ouertakes th'offender going before.

### 1.144. Riches. Deſcription of Mammon.

At laſt he came vnto a gloomy glade,

Couered with boughes and ſhades from heauen light:

Whereas he ſitting found in ſecret ſhade,

An vncouth, ſaluage, and vnciuill wight,

Of griſly hue, and foule ilfauoured ſight:

His face with ſmoake was tand, and eies were bleard,

His head and beard with ſowte were all bedight,

His coale blacke hands did ſeeme to haue bene ſeard,

In ſmith-fiers ſpitting forge, & nails like claws appeard.

His Iron coate all ouergrowne with ruſt,

Was vnderneath enueloped with gold,

Whoſe glittering gloſe darkened with filthy duſt

Well it appeared to haue bene of old,

A worke of rich entraile and curious molde,

Wouen with Anticks and wilde Imagerie,

And in his lap a maſſe of coyne he tolde

And turned vpſide downe to feed his eie,

A couetous deſire with his huge treaſurie:

And round about him lay on euery ſide,

Great heapes of gold that neuer could be ſpent,

Of Mulcibers deuouring element:

Some others were nere driuen and diſtent

[[Page 257]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=135)Into great
Ingoes and to wedges ſquare,

Some in round plates without monument:

But ſome were ſtampt, and in their end all bare,

The Anticke ſhapes of Kings and Keyſars, ſtrange and rare.

Ed. Spencer.

Mammon.

—I riches reade

And deeme them roote of all diſquietnes:

Firſt got with guile, and then preſeru'd with dread,

And after ſpent with pride and lauiſhnes:

Leauing behind them griefe and heauines.

Infinit miſchiefes of them do ariſe,

Strife and debate, blood-ſhead and bitternes,

Outragious wrong, and helliſh couetize,

That noble heart as great diſhonor doth deſpiſe.

Idem.

—It's but a little ſlide

That doth the houſe of riches from her mouth diuide.

Before the doore ſate ſelfe-conſuming care,

Day and night keeping wary watch and ward:

For feare leaſt fotce or fraud ſhould vnaware

Breake in and ſpoyle the treaſure there ingard.

Ne would he ſuffer ſleepe once thitherward

Approach, albe his drowſie den were next,

For next to death is ſleepe to be compar'd,

Therefore his houſe is vnto his annext,

Here ſleep, there riches, & hel gate them both betwixt.

Ed. Spencer.

VVell may a rich mans hearſe want teares, but heires he ſhall not miſſe,

To whom that he is dead at length no little ioy it is.

vv. vvarner.

[[Page 258]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=136)

Good is no good, but if it be ſpend,

God giueth good for no other end.

Ed. Spencer.

Veſſels of braſſe, oft handled brightly ſhine,

What difference betweene the richeſt mine

And baſeſt earth, but vſe? for both not vſde

Are of little worth: then treaſure is abuſde

When miſers keepe it, being put to lone,

In time it will returne vs two for one.

Ch. Marlowe.

Gold is a ſutor, neuer tooke repulſe,

It carries Palme with it, (where e're it goes)

Reſpect, and obſeruation; it vncouers

The knottie heads of the moſt ſurly Groomes,

Enforcing yron doores to yeeld it way,

Were they as ſtrong ram'd vp as Aetna gates.

It bends the hams of Goſſip Vigilance,

And makes her ſupple feete, as ſwift as winde.

It thawes the froſtieſt, and moſt ſtiffe diſdaine:

Muffles the clearneſſe of Election,

Straines fancie vnto foule Apoſtacie.

And ſtrikes the quickeſt-ſighted Iudgement blinde.

Then why ſhould we diſpaire? diſpaire? Away:

Where Gold's the Motiue, women haue no Nay.

B. Iohnſon.

Wealth in this age will ſcarcely looke on merit.

Idem.

—Gentry doth ſmall auaile,

And vertue leſſe, if lands and riches faile.

S. I. H.

### 1.145. Sacriledge.

The common text ſhall haue a common gloſſe,

[[Page 259]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=136)Receits in
parcels, ſhall be paid in groſſe.

This doctrine preach'd who from the church doth take

At laſt ſhall trebble reſtitution make.

M. Dray.

### 1.146. Secrecie.

—Secrecie the crowne of a true Louer.

M. Drayton.

—Hard it is to proue

By ſight or ſpeech, what bides in ſecret breſt.

S. I. H.

—What can ſo ſecret bee,

But out of it will when we do leaſt ſuſpect?

For poſts haue eares, and walles haue eyes to ſee,

Dumbe beaſts and birds haue toongs ill to detect.

Idem.

### 1.147. Silence.

Dumbe Silence, ſworne attendant on black night,

Thou that haſt power to cloſe vp murmures iawe:

To ſtop the barking of the watchfull hound,

And charme the gagling of thoſe waking fowle,

That ſau'd Ioues Capitoll, milde Queene of reſt.

Th. Dekkar.

Soft Silence, and ſubmiſſe obedience,

Both linkt together neuer do depart:

Both gifts of God, nor gotten but from thence,

Both girlonds of his ſaints, againſt their foes offence.

Ed. Spencer.

—Silence wiſedomes mother.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Silence doth ſeem the maske of baſe oppreſſion.

Idem.

[[Page 260]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=137)

### 1.148. Sences.

Although things ſenſible be numberleſſe,

But only fiue the Sences organs bee:

And in thoſe fiue all things their formes expreſſe,

Which we can touch, taſte, feele, or heare or ſee.

I. Dauies.

Mans eye makes what is ſeene to ſeeme ſo faire,

Mans eare makes what is heard to ſound ſo ſweete:

His touch by ſoftneſſe euery ſence is meete

For his owne obiect.

Idem.

### 1.149. Sight.

—The two eyes which haue the ſeeing power,

Stand as one watchman, ſpie, or Sentinell:

Being plac'd aloft within the heads hie tower,

And though both ſeeing, yet both but one thing tell.

Idem.

—Nine things to ſight required are,

The power to ſee, the light, the viſible thing:

Being not too ſmall, too thin, too nigh, too farre,

Cleare ſpace; and time the forme diſtinct to bring.

Idem.

Like as a glaſſe is an inanimate eye,

And outward formes imbraceth outwardly,

So is the eye an amimate glaſſe that ſhowes

In formes without vs.

G. Chapman.

What we behold is cenſured by the eyes,

Where both deliberate the loue is ſlight:

[[Page 261]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=137)Who euer
lou'd, that lou'd not at firſt ſight?

Ch. Marlowe.

I trow that countenance cannot lye,

Whoſe thoughts are legible in the eye.

M. Roydon.

Often the eye miſtakes, the braine being troubled.

W. Sha.

All amorous eyes obſeruing forme, thinks parts obſcured beſt.

vv. vvarner.

A greedy eye will haue a greedy hand.

D. Lodge.

—A monſtrous rabblement

Of fowle miſhapen wights, of which ſome were

Headed like Owles, with beakes vncomely bent:

Others like dogs, others like gryphons dreare,

And ſome had wings, and ſome had clawes to teare.

And euery one of them had Linceus eies,

And euery one did bowes and arrowes beare.

All thoſe were lawleſſe luſts, corrupt enuie,

And couetous aſpects, all cruell enemies.

Thoſe ſame againſt the bulwarke of the ſight

Did laie ſtrange ſiege and battailous aſſault,

Ne once did yeeld it reſpit day or night,

But ſoone as Titan gan his head exault,

And ſoone againe as he his light withhault

Their wicked engines they againſt it bent:

That is each thing by which the eyes may fault.

But to them all more huge and violent,

Bewtie and money, they that bulwarke ſhroudly rent.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 262]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=138)

### 1.150. Hearing.

Eares office is the troubled aire to take,

Which in their mazes formes a ſound or noyſe,

Whereof her ſelfe doth true diſtinction make.

The wickets of the ſoule are plac'd on hie,

Becauſe all ſounds do lightly mount aloft:

And that they may not pierce too violently,

They are delaid with turnes and windings oft.

I. Dauies.

As ſtreames which with their winding bankes do play,

Stopt by their creekes runne ſoftly through the plaine:

So in the eares labyrinth the voyce doth ſtay,

And doth with eaſie notice touch the braine.

Idem.

It is the ſlow'ſt yet the daintieſt ſence,

For euen the eares of ſuch as haue no skill,

Perceiue a diſcord and conceiue offence,

And knowing not what's good, yet finde the ill.

Idem.

Theſe conduit pipes of knowledge the minde,

But th'other three attend the body ſtill:

For by their ſeruices the ſoule doth finde

What things are to the body good or ill.

I. Dauies.

The ſecond bulwarke was the hearing ſence,

Gainſt which the ſecond troupe deſignment makes

Deformed creatures, in ſtraunge difference,

Some hauing heads like harts, ſome like to ſnakes,

Some wild like boares, late rowz'd out of the brakes.

Slaunderous reproaches and foule infamies,

[[Page 263]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=138)Leaſings,
backbitings, and vaine-glorious crake.

Bad counſels, praiſes and falſe flatteries,

All thoſe againſt that firſt did ſend their batteries.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.151. Smelling.

Next, in the noſthrils ſhe doth vſe the Smell,

As God the breath of life in them did giue:

So makes he now his power in them to dwell,

To iudge all aires whereby we breathe and hue.

This ſence is alſo miſtreſſe of an art,

Which to ſoft people ſweet petfumes doth ſell:

Through this deare art doth little good impart,

Since they ſmell beſt that doth of nothing ſmell.

And ye good ſents do purifie the braine,

Awake the fancie, and the wittes refine:

Hence old deuotion in aduiſe did ordaine,

To make mens ſpirits more apt to thoughts diuine.

I. Dauies.

Likewiſe that ſame third fort that is the ſmell,

Of that third troupe was cruelly aſſaide:

Whoſe hideous ſhapes were like to fiends of hell.

Some like to hounds, ſome like to apes diſmaide.

Some like to puttocks all in plumes arraide,

All ſhapte according their conditions,

For by thoſe ougly formes werren portraide

Fooliſh delights and fond abuſions,

Which do that ſence beſiege with light illuſiōs.

Ed. Sp.

### 1.152. Tasting

The bodies life with meates and aire is fed,

Therefore the ſoule doth vſe the taſting power,

In vaines which through the tong & pallat ſpred.

[[Page
264]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=139)Diſtinguiſh euery
relliſh ſweet and ſower.

This is the bodies nurſe: but ſince mans wit

Found the Art of cookery to delight his ſence,

More bodies are conſumde and kild with it,

Then with the ſword, famine, or peſtilence.

I. Dauies.

—That fourth band which cruell battery bent

Againſt the fourth bulwarke, that is the taſte:

Was as the reſt, a griſly rabblement,

Some mouth like greedy Eſtriges, ſome fac'ſt

Like loathly Toades, ſome faſhioned in the waſte

Like ſwine, for ſo deſeru'd his luxurie,

Surfet, miſdiet, and vnthriftie warke,

Vaine feaſts, and idle ſuperfluitie,

All thoſe this ſences fort aſſaile inceſſantly.

Ed. Sp.

### 1.153. Feeling.

Laſtly, the feeling power which is lifes roote,

Through euery liuing part it ſelfe doth ſhed,

By ſinewes which extend from head to foote,

And like a net all ouer the body ſpred.

Much like a ſubtill ſpider which doth ſit

In middle of her web which ſpreddeth wide:

If ought do touth the outmoſt thred of it,

She feeles it inſtantly on euery ſide.

I. Dauies.

By touch the firſt pure qualities we learne,

Which quicken all things, hot, cold, moiſt, and drie:

By touch, hard, ſoft, rough, ſwoot, we do diſcerne,

By touch, ſweet pleaſure and ſharpe paine we trie.

Theſe are the outward inſtruments of ſence.

[[Page 265]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=139)Theſe are
the guardes which euery one muſt paſſe,

Ere it approach the mindes intelligence,

Or touch the phantaſie, wits looking glaſſe.

Idem.

But the fift troupe moſt horrible of hue,

And fierce of force was dreadfull to report:

For ſome like ſnailes, ſome did like ſpiders ſhewe,

And ſome like ougly vrchins thicke and ſhort,

Cruelly they aſſailed that fift fort▪

Armed with darts of ſenſuall delight,

With ſtrings of carnall luſt and ſtrong effect.

Of feeling pleaſures, with which day and night

Againſt the ſame fift bulwarke they continued fight.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.154. Sinne.

Firſt we do taſte the fruite, then ſee our ſin.

S. Daniell.

Shame followes ſin, diſgrace is daily giuen,

Impietie will out, neuer ſo cloſely donne,

No walles can hide vs from the eye of heauen,

For ſhame muſt end what wickednes begun,

Forth breakes reproach when we leaſt thinke thereon.

Idem.

Like as diſeaſes common cauſe of death,

Bring daunger moſt when leaſt they pricke and ſmart:

Which is a ſigne they haue expulſt the breath

Of liuely heate which doth defend the hart,

Euen ſo ſuch ſinnes as felt are on no part,

Haue conquered grace, and by their wicked vre,

So kild the ſoule that it can haue no cure.

I. Hig. M. of M.

[[Page 266]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=140)

Sinnes harueſt neuer failes, but grace hath death.

D. Lodge.

Couer thou fier neuer ſo cloſe within,

Yet out it will, and ſo will ſecret ſin.

M. of M.

It doubles ſinne if finely ſinne we practiſe to preuent.

W.W.

Man may ſecurely ſinne, but ſafely neuer.

B. Ihonſon.

What wight on earth can voyd of fault be found?

What Saint is that who doth not ſinne ſometime?

Tweene good and bad this difference ſole is found,

That good men ſinne but ſeld, and mend betime.

The bad man (making ſcruple none nor queſtion)

Yeelds willingly to euery leaud ſuggeſtion.

S. I. H.

Sinnes oft aſſaid, ere thought to be no ſin,

So ſoileth ſinne, the ſoule it ſinketh in.

M. of M.

Shame leaues vs by degrees, not at firſt comming,

For nature checks a new offence with loathing.

But vſe of ſinne doth make it ſeeme as nothing.

S. Daniell.

What though our ſinnes go braue and better clad?

They are as thoſe in rags, as baſe, as bad.

Idem.

The ſpot is foule, though by a Monarch made,

Kings cannot priuiledge a ſinne forbade.

Idem.

—Sinne euer muſt

Be torturde with the racke of his owne frame,

[[Page 267]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=140)For he
that holds no faith, ſhall finde no truſt,

But ſowing wrong, is ſure to reape the ſame.

Idem.

— Cunning ſinne being clad in vertues ſhape,

Flies much reproofe, and many ſtormes doth ſcape.

D. Lodge.

—Place for people, people place, and all for ſinne decay.

vv. vvarner.

To puniſh ſinne is good, it is no nay,

They wrecke not ſinne, but merit wrecke for ſinne

The fathers fault that wreake vpon the kin.

M. of M.

The ſinne to which a man by loue is driuen,

So much rhe rather ought to be forgiuen.

S. I. H.

### 1.155. Slaunder.

Her face was vgly, and her mouth diſtort,

Foming with poyſon round about her gils,

In which her curſed tongue full ſharpe and ſhort,

Appeard like Aſpes ſting, that cloſely kils,

Or cruelly does wound, whom ſo ſhe wils,

A diſtaffe in her other hand ſhe had,

Vpon the which ſhe litle ſpins but ſpils,

And faine to weaue falſe tales and leaſings bad

To throw amongſt the gods which others had diſpred.

Ed. Sp.

Her nature is, all goodneſſe to abuſe,

And cauſeleſſe crimes continually to frame:

With which ſhe guiltleſſe perſons may abuſe,

[[Page 268]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=141)And ſtole
away the crowne of her good name,

Ne euer knight ſo bold, ne euer dame

So chaſte and loyall liu'd, but ſhe would ſtriue

With forged cauſe, them falſly to defame.

Ne euer thing was done ſo well aliue,

But ſhe with blame would blot, and of due praiſe de­priue.

Idem.

All like the ſtings of Aſps, that kill with ſmart,

Her ſpightfull words do pierce and wound the inner part.

Idem.

Foule canker of faire vertuous action,

Vile blaſter of rhe freſh bloomes here on earth,

Enuies abhorred child detraction.

I. Marston.

Happie is he that liues in ſuch a ſort,

That need not feare the tongues of falſe report.

E. of S.

The vulgar tongues are armed euermore

With ſlaunderous brute, to blemiſh the renowne

Of vertuous dames; which though at firſt it ſpring,

Of ſlender cauſe, yet doth it ſwell ſo faſt,

As in ſhort ſpace it filleth euery eare

With ſwift report of vndeſerued blame.

G. Gaſcoigne.

—It euer hath bene knowne,

They other vertues ſcorne that doubt their owne.

S. Daniell.

No plaiſter heales a deadly poyſoned ſore,

No ſecret hid where ſlaunder keepes the dore.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 269]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=141)

Againſt bad tongues goodneſſe cannot defend her,

Thoſe be moſt free from faults, they leaſt will ſpare,

But prate of them whom they haue ſcantly knowne,

Iudging their humours to be like their owne.

S. I. H.

Slaunder once ſet on foot though falſe, is talkt in euery ſtreet.

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

No wound with warlike hand of enemie

Inflict with dint of ſword ſo ſore doth light,

As doth the poyſonous ſting which infamie

Infuſeth in the name of noble wight.

It neuer can recured be againe,

Ne all the skill which that immortall ſpright

Of Podalyrius did in it retaine,

Can remedie ſuch hurts: ſuch hurts are helliſh paine.

Ed. Sp.

A ſprightly wit diſdaines detraction.

I. Marſton.

Backbiting pens, and pens that ſooth vp ſinne,

[...]nuious the one, th'other clawbacks binne.

I. Syl.

### 1.156. Sleepe.

Amidſt a darke thicke wood there is a caue,

Whoſe entrance is with Iuie ouerſpread,

They haue no light within, nor none they craue,

[...]ere Sleepe doth couch her ouerdrowſie head,

[...]nd ſloath lies by that ſeemes the goute to haue.

[...]nd Idlenes not ſo well taught as fed,

[...]hey point forgetfulnes the gate to keepe,

[...]hat none come out or in to hinder Sleepe.

[...]he knowes no meanes of men, ne none will learne,

[...]heir meſſages ſhe liſt not vnderſtand:

[[Page 270]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=142)She knowes
no buſines doth her concerne,

Silence is Sentinell of all this band,

And vnto thoſe he comming doth diſcerne

To come too neere, he beckens with his hand,

He treadeth ſoft, his ſhooes are made of felt,

His garment ſhort, and girded with a belt.

S. I. H.

By care lay heauie ſleepe, the couzen of death,

Flat on the ground, and ſtill as any ſtone:

A very corps, ſaue yeelding forth a breath,

Small keepe tooke he whom fortune frownd on,

Or whom ſhe lifted vp into the throne

Of high renowne: but as a liuing death,

So dead aliue, of life he drew the breath.

M. Sack.

A drowſie head to earth by dull deſire

Draws downe the ſoule that ſhould to heauen aſpire.

Writing theſe later lines, wearie well-nie

Of ſacred Pallas, pleaſing labour deare,

Mine humble chin ſaluteth oft my breſt,

With an Ambroſian deawe mine eies poſſeſt

By peece-meale cloſe; all moouing powers die ſtill,

From my dull fingers drops my fainting quill.

Downe in my ſloath-bound bed againe I ſhrinke,

And in darke Laethe all deepe cares I ſinke.

I. Syl.

### 1.157. Solitarineſſe.

Sweete ſolitarie life thou true repoſe,

Wherein the wiſe contemplate heauen aright,

In thee no dread of warre or worldly foes,

In thee no pompe ſeduceth mortall ſight.

In thee no wanton eares to winne with words,

Nor lurking toies which ſilly life affords.

D.L.

[[Page 271]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=142)

### 1.158. Souldiers.

— O Souldiers enuie neere ally to Kings

Maieſticke humour, carefull iealous thought:

Thou, which awak'ſt vs from ignoble things,

A paſſion neareſt to a godhead brought.

Onely indefinite: to whom none brings

Limit or bound, thou greater then our thought,

Who holds thee, holds a power to make him able,

Who looſes then, becomes moſt miſerable.

I. Mark,

None is ſo poore of ſence and eine,

To whom a ſouldier doth not ſhine.

G. Chap.

No elegancie can bewtifie

A ſhameleſſe lumpe of gluttonie:

His heart ſweete Cupids tents reiects,

That onely meate and drinke affects.

O Flora all mens intellects,

Know ſouldiers power ſuch reſpects,

Meere helpes for need his minde ſufficeth,

Dull ſleepe and ſurfets he deſpiſeth:

Loues trumpe his temples exerciſeth,

Courage and loue his life compriſeth.

Idem.

### 1.159. Soule.

— He that ſpread the skies

And fixt the earth, firſt form'd the ſoule in man,

This true Prometheus firſt made men of earth,

And ſhead in him a beame of heauenly fier,

Now in their mothers wombes before their birth,

Doth in all ſonnes of men their ſoules inſpire.

And as Minerua is in fables fainde

From Ioue, without an other to proceed,

So our true Ioue without an others aide,

[[Page 272]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=143)Doth daily
millions of Mineruaes breed.

I Dauies.

Like as the ſunne aboue the light doth bring,

Though we behold it in the aire belowe,

So from the eternall light the ſoule doth ſpring,

Though in the body ſhe her powers do ſhowe.

Idem.

The ſoule a ſubſtance and a body is,

Which God himſelfe doth in the body make,

Which makes the man; or euery man from this

The nature of a man and name doth take.

And though the ſpirit be to the body knit,

As an apt meane her power to exerciſe:

Which are, life, motion, ſenſe, and will and wit,

Yet ſhe ſuruiues, although the body dies.

Shee is a ſubſtance and a reall thing,

Which hath it ſelfe an actuall working might,

Which neither from the ſenſes power doth ſpring,

Nor from the bodies humours tempered right.

She is a vine which doth no propping need,

To make her ſpread her ſelfe, or ſpring vpright,

She is a ſtarre whoſe beames do not proceed

From any ſinne, but from a natiue light.

Idem.

She is a ſpirit and an heauenly influence,

Which from the fountaine of Gods ſpirit doth flowe,

Shee's a ſpirit, yet not like aire nor winde,

Nor like the ſpirits about the heart or braine,

Nor like the ſpirits which Alchimiſts definde,

When they in euery thing ſeeke gold in vaine.

Idem.

[[Page 273]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=143)

—To ſhew her powerfull deitie,

Her ſweete Endimion more to beautifie,

Into his ſoule the goddeſſe doth infuſe,

The fierie Nature of an heauenly Muſe:

Which the ſpirit labouring by the mind,

Partaketh of celeſtiall things by kind:

For why the ſoule being diuine alone,

Exempt from groſſe and vild corruption,

Of heauenly ſecrets incomprehenſible,

Of which the dull fleſh is not ſenſible▪

And by one onely powerfull facultie,

Yet gouerneth a multiplicitie,

Being eſſentiall, vniforme in all,

Not to be ſeuered or diuiduall:

But in her function holdeth her eſtate,

By powers diuine in her ingenerate:

And ſo by inſpiration conceiueth,

What heauen to her by diuination breatheth.

M. Drayton.

Like as the ſoule doth rule the earthlie maſſe,

And all the ſeruice of the body frame,

So loue of ſoule doth loue of body paſſe,

No leſſe then perfect gold ſurmounts the meaneſt braſſe,

Ed. Spencer.

Euerie good motion that the ſoule awakes,

A heauenly figure ſees from whence it takes,

That ſweeteleſſe bloome which by power of kinde,

Formes like it ſelfe an image of the mind,

And in our faith the operations be,

Of that diuineſſe which by fayth wee ſee,

[[Page 274]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=144)Which
neuer erres but accidentally,

By our fraile fleſhes in becilitie,

By each temptation ouer-apt to ſlide,

Except our ſpirit becomes our bodyes guide.

For as our bodyes priſons bee the towres,

So to our ſoules theſe bodyes be of ours,

Whoſe fleſhly walles hinder that heauenly light,

As theſe ſtone walles depriue our wiſhed ſight.

Idem.

— As Phoebus throwes

His beames abroade, though hee in clouds bee cloſ'd

Still glauncing by them till ſhe finde oppoſ'd

A looſe and rorid vapour, that is fit

T'euent his ſearching beames, and vſeth it

To forme a twentie coloured eie,

Caſt in a circle round about the skie.

So when our fierie ſoule, our bodies ſtarre,

(That euer is in motion circular)

Conceiues a form in ſeeking to diſplay it,

Through all our cloudy parts it doth conuey it:

Forth at the eye, as the moſt pregnant place,

And that reflects it round about the face.

Idem.

Like as the moyſture which the thirſtie earth

Sucks from the Sea to fill her emptie vaines,

From out her wombe at laſt doth take a birth,

And runnes a nymph along the graſsie plaines:

Long doth ſhee ſtay, as loth to leaue the land,

From whoſe ſoft ſide ſhe firſt did iſſue make,

She taſts all places, turnes to euerie hand,

Her flowing bankes vnwilling to forſake,

[[Page 275]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=144)Yet nature
ſo her ſtreames doth leade and carrie,

As that her courſe doth make no finall ſtay,

Till ſhee her ſelfe vnto the Ocean marrie,

Within whoſe watrie boſome firſt ſhee lay.

Euen ſo our ſoule within this earthly mould,

The ſpirit doth ſecretly infuſe,

Becauſe at firſt ſhee doth the earth behold,

And onely this materiall world ſhee viewes.

At firſt our mother earth ſhee holdeth deere,

And doth imbrace the world and worldly things,

She flies cloſe to the ground and houers heere,

And mounts not vp with her celeſtiall wings.

Yet vnder heauen ſhee cannot light on ought,

That with her heauenly nature doth agree,

She cannot reſt, ſhe cannot fixe her thought,

She cannot in this world contented bee.

I. Dauies.

When the ſoule findes heere no true content,

And like Noahs Doue, can no ſure footing take,

She doth returne from whence ſhee firſt was ſent,

And flies to him that firſt her wings did make.

Idem.

Heuen waxeth old, and all the ſpheres aboue

Shall one day faynt, and their ſwift motion ſtay,

And time it ſelfe ſhall ceaſe in time to mooue,

Onely the ſoule ſuruiues and liues for aye.

Idem.

When as the ſoule is drowned once in vice,

The ſweete of ſinne makes hell a Paradice▪

M, Drayton,

[...]s is the fable of the Lady faire,

[[Page 276]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=145)VVhich for
her luſt was turnde into a cow,

VVhen thirſtie to a ſtreame ſhe did repaire,

And ſaw her ſelfe transformde ſhe knew not how,

At firſt ſhe ſtartles, and ſhe ſtands amazd,

And loathes the watry glaſſe wherein ſhe gazd:

At laſt for terror ſhe from thence doth flie,

And ſhunnes it ſtill, though ſhe for thirſt doe die.

Euen ſo mans ſoule, which did Gods image beare,

And was at firſt faire, good, and ſpotleſſe pure,

Since with her ſinnes her beauties blotted were,

Doth of all ſights her owne ſight leaſt indure:

For euen at firſt reflecting ſhe eſpies

Such ſtrange Chimeraes and ſuch monſters there,

Such toyes, ſuch antickes, and ſuch vanities,

As ſhe retyres, and ſhrinks for ſhame and feare.

I. Dauis.

Euen as the man loues leaſt at home to bee,

That hath a ſluttiſh houſe haunted with ſpirits,

So ſhe impatient her owne faults to ſee,

Turnes from her ſelfe, and in ſtrange things delights▪

Idem.

—Tis a ſacred cure

To ſalue the ſoules dread wounds, omnipotent

That nature is, that cures the impotent

Euen in a moment, ſure grace is infuſde

By diuine fauour, nor by actions vſde:

Which is as permanent as heauens bliſſe,

To them that haue it, then no habit is.

I. Marſton.

That learned Father which ſo firmely prooues

The ſoule of man immortall and diuine,

[[Page 277]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=145)And doth
the ſeuerall offices define.

Anima.

Giues her that name as ſhe the body moues.

Amor.

Then is ſhee loue imbracing charitie.

Animus.

Mouing a will in vs, it is the mind.

Mens.

Retaining knowledge ſtill the ſame in kind.

Memoria.

As intellectuall it is the memorie.

Ratio.

In iudging, Reaſon onely is her name.

Senſus.

In ſpeedie apprehenſion it is Sence.

Conſcientia.

In right or wrong men call her Conſcience.

Spiritus.

The Spirit, when to Godward it doth inflame.

Theſe of the ſoule the ſeuerall functions bee.

M. Drayton.

Like as two bellowes blowne turne by turne,

By little and little make cold coles to burne,

And then their fire inflamde with glowing heate,

An iron barre which on the Anuile beate,

Seemes no more yron, but flies almoſt all,

In hiſsing ſparkles and quicke-bright cinders ſmall.

So the worlds ſoule ſhould in our ſoule inſpire,

Th'eternall force of an eternall fire,

And then our ſoule (as forme) breathe in our corſe,

Her countleſſe numbers, and heauens turned force,

[[Page 278]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=146)Wherewith
our bodyes beautie beautified,

Should like our (deathleſſe ſoule) haue neuer died.

I. Syluester.

### 1.160. Of Sorrow.

In blacke all clad there fell before my face,

A ptiteous wight whom woe had all forewaſt,

Forth on her eyes the criſtall teares out braſt,

And ſighing fore her hands ſhee wrung and fold,

Tare all her haire, that ruth was to behold;

Her body ſmall, ſore withered and fore ſpent,

As is the ſtalke that ſummers drought oppreſt,

Her welked face with wofull teares beſprent:

Her colour pale (as it ſeemed) her beſt,

In woe and plaint repoſed was her reſt:

And as the ſtone that drops of water weares,

So dented were her cheekes with fall of teares:

Her eyes ſwollen with flowing ſtreames afloate,

Wherewith her lookes throwne vp full pitiouſly,

Her forceleſſe handes together oft ſhe ſmote,

With dolefull ſhrikes that ecchoed in the ſkie,

Whoſe plaints ſuch ſighs did ſtrait accompanie,

That in my doome was neuer man did ſee

A wight but halfe ſo woe-begone as ſhee.

Sorrow I am, in endleſſe ſorrowes pained,

Among the furies in the infernall lake,

Where Pluto God of hell ſo griſly blacke,

Doth hold his throne and Laethes deadly taſte,

Doth riue remembrance of each thing fore-paſt.

M. Sackuile.

Sorrows firſt leader of this furious crowde,

[[Page 279]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=146)Muffled
all ouer in a ſable clowde,

Olde before age, afflicted night and day,

Her face with wrinkles warped euerie way,

Creeping in corners, where ſhee ſits and vies;

Sighs from her heart, teares for her blubbered eies,

Accompanied with ſelfe-conſuming care,

With weeping pittie, thought, and mad diſpayre,

That beares about her burning coles and cords,

Aſpes, poyſons, piſtols, haulters, kniues, and ſwords,

Foule ſquinting enuie, that ſelfe-eating elfe,

Through others leanneſſe fatting vp her ſelfe,

Ioyning in miſchiefe, feeding but with langour,

And bitter teares, her toad-like ſwelling anger,

And iealouſie that neuer ſleepes for feare,

(Suſpitious flea ſtill nibling in her eare)

That leaues repaſt and reſt, neere pinde and blinde,

With ſeeking what ſhee would bee loth to finde.

I. Silueſter.

Two inward vulturs, ſorrow and diſdaine.

Sorow miſfortunes ſonne, diſpayres foule fire.

Ed. Fairfax.

Sorrow breakes ſeaſons and repoſing howres,

Makes the night morning, and the noone tide night,

W. Shakeſpeare.

Sorrow is ſtill vnwilling to giue ouer.

S. Daniell.

Sorrow grows ſenceleſſe when too much ſhe beares.

M. Dr.

Sad ſorrow like a heauie ringing bell,

Once ſet in ringing, with his owne weight goes,

Then little ſtrength rings out the dolefull knel.

W. Sh.

[[Page 280]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=147)

It is ſome eaſe our ſorrowes to reueale,

If they to whome we ſhall impart our woes,

Seeme but to feele a part of what we feele.

And meete vs with a ſigh but at a cloſe.

S. Daniell.

Sighes are the eaſe calamitie affoords,

Which ſerue for ſpeech when ſorrow wanteth words.

Idem.

Fell ſorrowes tooth neuer ranckles more,

Then when it bites, but launcheth not the ſore.

Idem.

—Sorrow cloſe ſhrouded in the heart.

I know to keep, it is a wondrous ſmart,

Each thing imparted, is more eaſe to beare,

When the raine is fallen, the cloudes waxe cleere.

Ed. Spencer.

— Sorrow ne neede be haſtened on,

For he will come without calling anon.

Idem.

—Snarling ſorrow hath leſſe powrc to bite

The man that mocks at it, and ſets it light.

Ed. Spencer.

He that his ſorrow ſought through wilfulneſſe,

And his foe fettered would releaſe againe,

Deſerues to taſt his follies fruit, repented paine.

Ed. Spencer.

— Mirth doth ſearch the bottom of annoy,

Sad ſoules are ſlaine in mirthie companie,

Greefe beſt is pleaſde with griefes ſocietie:

True ſorrow then is feelingly ſuffizde,

[[Page 281]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=147)When with
like ſorrow it is ſympathizde.

True ſorrow hath not euer a wet eye.

Th. Dekker.

Sad ſorrow euer ioyes to heare her worſt.

S. D.

### 1.161. Suſpition.

— Falſe ſuſpition of another is

A ſure condemning of our owne amis.

Edw. Gilpin.

Miſtruſt doth treaſon in the trueſt raiſe,

Suſpitious Romulus ſtain'd his walles firſt rear'd

VVith brothers bloud, whom for light leape he feard,

The iealous cuckold weares th'infamous horne,

So not in brotherhood, iealouſie may bee borne.

M. of M.

Riualles in loue will be ſuſpitious quickly.

I. Weeuer.

The Marchant traffiking abroad, ſuſpects his wife at home

A youth wil play the wanton, & a wanton proue a mome.

W. Warner.

### 1.162. Teares.

—Theſe two parts belong

Vnto true knowledge, words and teares haue force,

To mooue compaſsion in the ſauage mindes

Of brutiſh people reaſon wanting kindes.

Tho. Middleton.

Teares, vows, and prayers gaine the hardeſt hearts.

S. Daniell.

Teares worke no truce, but where the heart is tender.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 282]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=148)

Teares harden luſt, though marble weare with raine.

W. Sh.

Seld ſpeaketh loue, but ſighes his ſecret paines,

Teares are his truch-men, words do make him trem­ble.

R. Greene.

Teares cannot ſoften flint, nor vowes conuert.

S. D.

A dolefull caſe deſires a dolefull ſong,

Without vaine art, or curious complement,

And ſquallid fortune into baſeneſſe flung,

Doth ſcorne the pride of wonted ornament.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.163. Temperance.

—Temperance which golden ſquire,

Betwixt theſe two can meaſure out a meane,

Neither to melt in pleaſures hot deſire,

Nor frie in heartleſſe greefe and dolefull teene,

Thriſe happie man who faires them both a tweene.

Ed. Spencer.

Who euer doth to Temperance applie

His ſtedfaſt life, and all his actions frame,

Truſt mee ſhall finde no greater enemie,

Then ſtubburne perturbation to the ſame:

To which right well the wiſe doe giue that name:

For it the goodly peace of ſtayed mindes

Does ouerthrew, and troublous warre proclaime,

His owne woes author, who ſo bound it finds,

As did Pyrrhocles, and it wilfully vnbinde.

Idem.

A harder leſſon to learne continence,

[[Page 283]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=148)In ioyous
pleaſure then in greeuous paine,

For ſweeteneſſe doth allure the weakeſt ſence.

So ſtrongly that vnneath it can refraine,

From that which feeble nature couers faine,

But greefe and wrath that bee her enemies

And foes of life ſhee better can reſtraine,

Yet vertue vaunts in both theyr victories.

Idem.

O in what ſafetie Temperance doth reſt,

VVhen it findes harbour in a kingly breſt.

M. Drayton.

Of all Gods works which do this world adorne,

There is none more fayre and excellent

Then is mans body, both for power and forme,

VVhilſt it is kept in ſober gouernement:

But none then it more foule and indecent,

Diſtempered through miſrules, and paſsions baſe,

It growes a monſter, and incontinent,

Doth looſe his dignitie and natiue grace.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.164. Thoughts.

Thoughts are the ſlaues of life, and life times foole,

And time that takes ſuruey of all the world

Muſt haue a ſtop.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Thoughts are but dreames, till their effects be tried.

Idem.

Who ſo thinkes many things, brings few to a fortunate ending.

A. Fraunce.

The feeble eyes of our aſpring thoughts,

Behold things preſent, and record things paſt,

[[Page 284]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=149)But things
to come exceede our humane reach.

G. Peele.

Vnfained thoughts do ſeldome dreame on euil.

Birdes neuer limde no ſecret buſhes feare.

W. Sh.

If all mens thoughts were written in their face,

Some one that now the reſt doth ouercrow,

Some others ebbe that wants his ſoueraignes grace,

VVhen as the Prince their inwarde thoughts ſhould know

The meaner then ſhould take the better place,

The greateſt man might ſtoope and ſit below.

S. I. Harrington.

### 1.165. Time.

Beauties great enemie, and to all the reſt

That in the garden of Adonis ſprings,

Is wicked Time, who with his ſithe addreſt,

Does mow the flowing herbes and goodly things,

And all their glorie to the earth downe flings,

VVhere they do wither, and are fouly marde,

He flies about, and with his flaggie wings,

Beates downe both leaues and buds without regard.

Ne euer pittie may relent his malice hard.

E. Spencer.

Miſhapen Time, coapſmate of vgly might,

Swift ſubtill poaſt, carrier of griſlie care,

Eater of youth, falſe ſlaue to falſe delight,

Baſe watch of woes, ſinnes packhorſe, vertues ſnare,

Thou nurſeſt all, and murthereſt all that are.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Stealing Time the ſubiect to delay.

S. Ph. Sydney.

[[Page 285]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=149)

—Times golden thigh

Vpholdes the flowrie body of the earth,

In ſacred harmonie and euerie birth

Of men, audacious makes legitimate,

Being vſde aright, the vſe of times is fate.

G. Chapman.

No mortall forme that vnder moone remaines,

Exempt from traiterous Time, continueth one.

Now mountes the floud, and ſtraight his waues re­ſtrains

Now flowes the tyde, and ſtrait the ſourſe is gone,

VVho toyles by Sea, muſt chooſe the fayreſt gale,

For time abodes our good or badde auaile▪

D. Lodge.

Al thoſe that liue and thinke themſelues but ſlime,

Muſt chooſe and thriue by fauour of the time.

Idem.

Swift ſpeedie Time, feathered with flying howres,

Diſſolues the beautie of the fayreſt browe.

S. Daniell.

Time doth conſume fame, honour, wit, & ſtrength,

Time roots out youth and beauties looke at length.

Tho. Watſon.

Time wanting bonds, ſtill wanteth certaintie.

M. Dr.

To Fames rich treaſure Time vnlocks the doore,

Which angrie ſorrow had ſhut vp before.

Idem.

Time is a bondſlaue to eternitie.

Tho. Kyd.

All that doth liue is ſubiect to his law,

[[Page 286]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=150)All things
decay in time, and to their end do draw.

Ed. Spencer.

What wrong hath not continuance out-worne,

Yeares makes that right that neuer was ſo borne.

S. Daniell.

Good time is bleſt, badde time wee hold accurſt,

Time hurts them oft that he did helpe at firſt.

T. Churchyard.

Times glory is to calme contending kings,

To vnmaske falſhood, and bring truth to light,

To ſtampe the ſeale of time in aged things,

To wake the morne, and ſentinell the night,

To wrong the wronger till hee render right:

To ruinate proude buildings with his howres,

And ſmeare with duſt their glittering golden towres,

To fill with worm holes ſtately monuments,

To feede obliuion with decay of things,

To blot old Bookes, and alter their contents,

To pull the quilles from auncient Rauens wings,

To drie the old okes ſappe, and cheriſh ſprings

To ſpoyle antiquities of hammered ſteele,

And turne the giddie round of fortunes wheele,

To ſhew the Beldame daughters of her daughters,

To make the child a man, the man a child,

To ſlay the tyger that doth liuely ſlaughter,

To tame the vnicorne and the lyon wilde,

To make the ſubtill in themſelues be guild,

To cheere the plow-man with increaſefull crops,

And waſte huge ſtones with little water-drops.

W. Shakeſpeare.

[[Page 287]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=150)

### 1.166. Truth.

The Truth doth doth dwell within the holy tables,

Of Gods liue word, not in our wanton braine,

Which dayly coyning ſome ſtrange error vaine,

For gold takes lead, for truth electeth Fables.

I. Siluester.

Truth is no harauld, nor no ſo ſophiſt ſure,

She noteth not mens names, their ſheelds or creſts,

Though ſhee compare them vnto birds and beaſts,

But whom ſhee doth fore-ſhew ſhall raigne by force,

Shee tearmes a woolfe, a dragon, or a beare,

A wilfull Prince, a raigneleſſe raging horſe,

A boare, a lion, a coward much in feare,

A hare or hart, a craftie pricked eare,

A lecherous, a bull, a goate, a foale,

An vnderminer, a mould-warpe, or a moale.

M. of M.

— Tried truth

Doth beſt be ſeeme a ſimple naked tale,

Ne needes to bee with paynted proceſſe prickt,

That in her ſelfe hath no diuerſitie,

But alwayes ſhewes one vndiſguiſed face,

VVhere deepe deceit and lies muſt ſeeke her ſhade,

And wrappe their words in guilefull eloquence,

As euer fraught with contrarietie.

G. Gaſcoigne.

The truth hath certaine bounds, but falſhood none.

S. Daniell.

— The naked truth is a well-clothed lie,

A nimble quicke pale meunts to dignitie

[[Page 288]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=151)By force
or fraud, that matters not a iot,

So maſsie wealth may fall vnto thy lot.

Io. Marston.

### 1.167. Treaſon.

Conſpiracie gainſt the perſon of a Prince,

Is treaſon gainſt the deitie of heauen.

Th. Achellye.

—Treaſon is but truſted like the Foxe,

Who nere ſo tamde, ſo cheriſht, and lockt vp,

Will haue a wilde tricke of his auncetors.

W. Sh.

No vertue merits prayſe once toucht with blot of treaſon.

S. Ph. Sydney.

VVho fayleth one is falſe, though truſty to another▪

Idem.

There is no treaſon woundeth halfe ſo deepe,

As that which doth in Princes boſome ſleepe.

M. Drayton.

VVho that reſiſteth his dread ſoueraigne Lord,

Doth damne his ſoule by Gods owne verie word,

A Chriſtian ſubiect ſhould with honour due,

Obey his ſoueraigne though he were a Iew,

VVhereby aſſured when ſubiects do rebell,

Gods wrath is kindled, threatning fire and hell.

M. of M.

Was neuer rebell before the world and ſince,

That could or ſhould preuaile againſt his Prince.

Idem.

Reuolted ſubiects of themſelues will quaile.

I. Syluester.

[[Page 289]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=151)

### 1.168. Tyrannie.

—Next to Tyrannie

Comes warres, diſcention, ciuill mutinie.

Ch. Middl.

In greateſt wants t'inflict the greateſt woe,

This is the worſt that tyrannie can ſhow.

Idem.

Hell haleth tyrants downe to death amaine,

Was neuer yet, nor ſhall bee cruell deede

Vnquited left, but had as cruell meed.

M. of M.

— No tyrant commonly

Liuing ill can kindly die,

But either trayterouſly ſurprizde

Doth coward poyſon quayle their breath,

Or their people haue deuizde,

Or theyr Guard to ſeeke their death.

Tho. Kyd.

It is an hell in hatefull vaſſallage,

Vnder a tyrant to conſume ones age,

A ſelfe-ſhauen Dennis, or an Nero fell,

Whoſe curſed Courts with bloud and inceſt ſwell:

An Owle that flyes the light of Parliaments

And ſtate aſſemblies, iealous of th'intents

Of Priuate tongues, who for a paſtime ſets

His Peeres at oddes, and on their furie whets,

Who neither fayth, honour, nor right reſpects.

Idem.

[[Page 290]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=152)

### 1.169. Ʋertue.

What one art thou thus in torne weede yclad?

Vertue, in price, whom auncient ſages had:

Why poorely clad? for fading goods paſt care:

Why double fac'd? I marke each fortunes rare:

This bridle what? mindes rages to reſtraine:

VVhy beare you tooles? I loue to take great paine:

Why wings? I teach aboue the ſtarres to flie:

Why treade you death? I onely cannot die.

S. Th. Wiat.

The path that leades to Vertues Court is narrow,

Thornie, and vp a hill, a bitter iourney:

But being gone through, you find al heauenly ſweets,

Th'entrance is all flintie, but at th'end

Two Towres of pearles and criſtall you aſcend.

Th. Dekkar.

Vertue is fayreſt in a poore art aye.

Idem.

Vertue abhorres too weare a borrowed face.

Idem.

The wiſeſt ſcholler of the wight moſt wiſe,

By Phoebus doome, with ſugred ſentence ſaies,

That vertue If it once meete with our eyes,

Strange flames of loue it in our ſoules would raiſe.

S. Ph. Sydney.

That growes apace, that vertue helps t'aſpire.

M. R [...]don.

When vertue riſeth, baſe affections fall.

Ed. Fairfax.

Like as the horſe well mand abides the bit,

[[Page 291]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=152)And
learnes his ſtoppe by raine in riders hand,

Where mountaine colt that is not ſadled yet,

Runnes headlong on amidſt the fallowed land,

Whoſe fierce reſiſt ſcarce bendes with any band.

So men reclaim'd by vertue tread aright,

Where ledde by follies, miſchiefes on them light.

D. Lodge.

Vertue doth  [...]urb affection, and for conſcience flieth ſin,

To leaue for imperfection feare or ſhame no praiſe doth winne.

W. Warner.

Vertue it ſelfe turnes vice, being miſapplyed,

And vice ſometime by action dignified.

W. Shakeſpeare.

Vertue in greateſt daunger is moſt ſhowne,

And though oppreſt, yet nere is ouerthrowne.

S. Daniell.

In vertue it is ſaid, that men themſelues ſuruie.

W. W.

Honour indeede, and all things yeeld to death,

(Vertue excepted) which alone ſuruiues,

And liuing toyleth in an earthlie gaile,

At laſt to be extol'd in heauens high ioyes.

T. Kyd.

All things decay, yet vertue ſhall not die,

This onely giues vs immortallitie.

M. Drayton.

Whence is it that the flower of the field doth fade,

And lyeth buried long in winters bale,

Yet ſoon as ſpring his mantle doth diſplay,

It flowreth freſh, as it ſhould neuer faile,

But thing on earth that is of moſt auaile.

As vertues and beauties bud,

[[Page 292]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=153)Releeuen
not for any good,

The branch once dead, the bud needes eke muſt quaile▪

Ed. Spencer.

All that wee had, or mortall men can haue,

Seemes onely hut a ſhadow from the graue,

Vertue alone liues ſtill.

Th. Dekkar.

Vertue is more amiable and more ſweete,

When vertue and true maieſtie doe meete.

E. Spencer.

—All the ſorow in the world is leſſe

Then vertues might and valures confidence,

For who will bide the burden of diſtreſſe,

Muſt not heere thinke to liue, for life is wretchednes.

Idem.

Vertue makes honour, as the ſoule doth ſence,

And merit, farre exceedes inheritance.

G. Chapman.

—Vertue of the  [...]uncient bloud and kin,

Doth onely pleaſe the parties ſhee is in.

M. of M.

—Onely vertue nobleneſſe doth dignifie,

And vicious life a linage baſe doth ſignifie.

S. I. Harrington.

The ſimple vertue may conſiſt alone,

But better are two vertues ioynd in one.

D. Lodge.

What vertue gets, once got doth neuer waſte,

And hauing this, this thou for euer haſte.

M. Dryaton.

Ioy grauen in ſence, like ſnow in water waſts,

[[Page 293]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=153)Without
preſerue of vertue nothings laſts.

G. Chapman.

Vertue obſcurde yeeldes ſmall and happie gaines,

But actiuely imployed, ſhee worth retaines.

D. Lodge.

VVhat vertue breedes, iniquitie deuours,

VVe haue no good at all that we can ſay is ours▪

But ill annexed oportunitie,

Or killes his life or elſe his qualitie.

W. Sh.

Vertue dies not, her tomb we need not rayſe,

Let them truſt tombs which haue out-liu'd their praiſe.

Th. Bastard.

### 1.170. Ʋice.

Vice rides a horſeback, Ʋertue doth from out the ſaddl [...] boult.

W. Warner.

What licour firſt the earthen pot doth take,

It keepeth ſtill the ſauour of the ſame,

Full hard it is a camocke ſtraight to make,

Or crooked logges with wainſcot fine to frame,

Tis hard to make the cruell Tyger tame:

And ſo it fares with thoſe haue vices caught,

Nought (once they ſay) and euer after nought.

M. of M.

Although  [...]hat vertue oft wants due reward,

Yet ſeldome vice wants due deſerued blame,

S. I. H.

Where vice is countenanc'd with Nobilitie,

Art cleane excluded, ignorance held in,

Blinding the world with meere hypocriſie,

[[Page 294]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=154)Yet muſt
bee ſooth'd in all their ſlauiſh ſinne,

Great malcontents to grow they then beginne,

Nurſing vild wittes to make their factious tooles,

Thus mightie men oft prooue the mightieſt fooles.

M. Drayton.

### 1.171. Ʋictory.

With victorie reuenge doth euer ceaſe,

S. I. H.

Hee liueth long that liues victorious.

Th. Kyd.

The victor can no honour iuſtly claime,

To looſe the men who ſhould aduaunce the ſame.

—That fiſher is not fine,

Who for a frogge will looſe a golden line:

The holy head-band ſeemes not to attyre

The head of him, who in his furious ire,

Preferres the paine of thoſe that haue him teend,

Before the health and ſafetie of one friend.

Tho. Hudſon.

Vaine is the vaunt and victorie vniuſt,

That more to mightie hands then rightful cauſe doth truſt.

Edw. Spencer.

Loſſe is no ſhame, nor to bee leſſe then foe,

But to be leſſer then himſelfe, doth marre

Both looſers lotte, and victors prayſe alſo,

Ʋaine others ouerthrowes, who ſelf doth ouerthrow.

Idem.

[[Page 295]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=154)

### 1.172. Ʋnderſtanding.

Moſt miſerable creature vnder skie

Man, without vnderſtanding doth appeare,

For all this worlds affliction he thereby,

And fortvnes freates is wiſely taught to beare:

Of wretched life the onely ioy ſhee is,

And th'onely comfort in calamitie,

She armes the breaſt with conſtant patience,

Againſt the bitter throwes of dolours darts,

She ſolaceth with rules of ſapience,

The gentle mindes in midſt of worldly ſmarts,

When hee is ſadde, ſhe ſeekes to make him merie,

And doth refreſh his ſpirits when they bee wearie,

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.173. Ʋowes.

Good vowes are neuer broken with good deedes,

For then good deedes were bad: vowes are but ſeeds,

And good deedes fruits.

G. Chapman.

Wee know not how to vow, till loue vnblind vs,

And vowes made ignorantly neuer binde vs.

Idem.

Our vowes muſt bee perform'd to God and King.

M. Drayton.

— A promiſe made for feare is voyde.

S. I. H.

— A man ſuch promiſe muſt forſake,

As at the firſt vnlawfull was to make.

Idem.

[[Page 296]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=155)

### 1.174. Ʋirginitie.

Like to the Roſe I count the virgin pure,

That groweth on natiue ſtemme in garden fayre,

Which whiles it ſtands with walles enuiron'd ſure,

VVhere herd-men with their herds cannot repayre

To ſauour it, it ſeemeth to allure

The morning dew, the heate, the earthly ayre,

Gallant yong men and louely dames delight

By their ſweete ſent, and in their pleaſing ſight:

But when that once tis gathered and gone

From proper ſtalke, where late before it grew,

The loue the liking little is or none,

Fauour, and grace, beautie and all adue:

So when a virgin graunts to one alone,

The precious flower for which ſo many ſue:

VVell hee that getteth it may loue her beſt,

But ſhee forgoes the loue of all the reſt.

S. I. H.

Iewels being loſt, are found againe, this neuer,

Tis loſt but once, and once loſt, loſt for euer.

Ch. Marlow.

Ʋirginitie though prayſed is like a bird, for why,

As much the fleſh is frayle therein, as in the feare to die,

What was it ſayd to all but vs increaſe and multiplie?

W. Warner.

— Virginitie

Is neither eſſence ſubiect to the eye,

No nor to any one exterior ſence,

Nor hath it any place of reſidence,

Nor i'ſt of earth or mould celeſtiall,

[[Page 297]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=155)Or capable
of any forme at all.

Ch. Marlow.

I know not her that willingly with maiden-head would die.

W. W.

### 1.175. Ʋſe.

Ʋſe make things nothing huge, and huge things no­thing.

G. Chapman.

Foule cankering ruſt the hidden treaſure frets.

But gold thats put to vſe, more gold begets.

W. Sh.

### 1.176. Warre.

Laſtly ſtood warre in gliſtering armes yclad,

With viſage grimme, ſterne lookes and gaſtly hood,

In his right hand a naked ſword hee had,

That to the hilts was all with bloud imbrude,

And in his left that kings and kingdomes rued,

Famine and fire he had, and there withall

Hee raſed townes, and threw downe towres and all,

Cities hee ſackt, and realmes that whilome flowred

In honour, glorie, and rule aboue the beſt,

Hee ouerwhhlm'd, and all their fame deuoured,

Conſumde, deſtroyde, waſted, and neuer ceaſt,

Till hee therewith their name and all oppreſt:

His face forhued with woundes, and by his ſide,

There hung his targe with gaſhes deepe and wide,

In midſt of which depainted there wee finde

Deadly debate, all full of ſnakie hayre,

That with a bloudy fillet was ybound,

[[Page 298]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=156)Out-
breathing noght, but diſcord euerie where.

M. Sackuille.

The Poets old in their fond fables faind,

That mightie Mars is God of warre and ſtrife:

Th' Aſtronomers think that wheras Mars doth raign

That all debate and diſcord muſt bee rife:

Some thinke Bellona, Goddeſſe of that life.

Among the reſt that Painter had ſome skill,

Which thus in armes did once ſet out the ſame,

A field of gules, and on a golden hill.

A ſtately towne conſumed all with flame,

On chiefe of ſable taken from the dame,

A ſucking babe (O) borne to bide miſchance,

Begoard with bloud, and pierced with a launce.

On high the Helme, I beare it well in mind,

The wreath was ſiluer powdred all with ſhot,

About the which (goutte du ſang) did twind.

A rowle of ſable blacke, and foule beblot,

The creſt two hands, which may not bee forgot,

For in the right a trenchand blade did ſtand,

And in the left a fierie burning brand.

G. Gaſcoigne.

— Warre the miſtreſſe of enormitie,

Mother of miſchiefe, monſter of deformitie,

Lawes, manners, arts, ſhee breakes, ſhee marres, ſhee chaces,

Bloud, teares, bowres, towres, ſhe ſpils, ſmites, burns, & races,

Her braſen teeth ſhake al the earth aſunder:

Her mouth a fire-brand, and her voyce a thunder,

Her lookes are lightning, euerie glaunce a flaſh,

Her fingers guns, that all to powder paſh,

Feare and diſpayre, flight and diſorder, coaſt

[[Page 299]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=156)With
haſtie march before her murderous hoaſt,

As burning, waſte, rape, wrong, impietie,

Rage, ruines, diſcord, horror, crueltie,

Sacke, ſacriledge, impunitie pride,

Are ſtill ſterne conſorts by her barbarous ſide.

And pouertie, ſorrow, and deſolation,

Follow her armies bloudie tranſmigration.

I· Siluester.

O warre begot in pride and luxurie,

The child of wrath and of diſſention▪

Horrible good, miſchiefe neceſſarie,

The foule reformer of confuſion:

Vniuſt iuſt, ſcourge for our iniquitie.

Cruell recurer of corruption.

S. Daniell.

O goodly vſage of thoſe anticke times,

In which the ſword was ſeruant vnto right,

Ʋ Ʋhen not for malice and contentious crimes,

But all for praiſe, and proofe of manly might,

The martiall broode accuſtomed to fight:

Then honour was the meede of victorie,

And yet the vanquiſhed had no diſpight,

Let later age, that now the vſe enuie,

Vild rancour ſo auoyd and cruell furquedry.

Ed. Spencer.

VVarre rightly handled is moſt excellent,

And eaſie makes impoſsibilitie:

It mounts the Alps, and through the ſeas doth rent▪

By it in bloud a way to heauen wee ſee.

I. Markham.

Vnder warres brazen feete ſtoopes all the earth,

[[Page 300]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=157)His mouth
a flaming brand, his voyce a thunder,

Idem.

No warre is right, but that which needfull is,

S. Daniell.

The God of warre hath many men in ſtore,

Which wait alwaies to keepe his kingdome vp,

Of whom no one doth ſhew his ſeruice more,

Then lingring hope, which ſtill doth be [...]re the cup,

And flatteringly lendes euerie man a ſup,

Which haunts his courſe, or in his progeſſe paſſe,

Hope brings the bowle wherin they all muſt quaffe,

G. Gaſcoigne.

Warre ſeemeth ſweete to ſuch as raunge it not.

Idem.

Men know not Warre, nor rightly how to deeme it,

That firſt by War haue not been taught t'eſteeme it.

S. I. H.

—Wiſe men euer haue preferred farre,

Th'vniuſteſt peace, before the iuſteſt Warre.

S. Daniell.

—Time obſeruing prouidence and Warre,

Still makes their foes farre ſtronger then they are.

Idem.

Sad be the ſights and bitter fruits of Warre,

And thouſande furies wait on wrathfull ſword,

Ne ought the prayſe of proweſſe more doth marre,

Then foule reuenging rage and proud contentious iarre.

Ed. Spencer.

—Great reuenew

The chiefeſt ſinew vnto Warre affoords.

D. Lodge.

[[Page 301]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=157)

—Warres that publike good pretend,

Worke moſt in iuſtice being doone for ſpight,

For th'agreeued euermore doe bend,

Againſt thoſe whom they ſee of greateſt might,

Who though themſelues are wrongd and often forſt,

Yet though they can doe moſt are thought the worſt.

S. Daniell.

—Mars is Cupidoes friend

And is for Ʋenus loue renouned more,

Then al the wars and ſpoiles the which he did before.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.177. Will.

From idle witte, there ſprings a braine-ſicke will,

With wiſe men luſt, which fooliſh make a God,

This in the ſhape of vertue raigneth ſtill.

D. Lodge.

Will puts in practiſe what the wit deuiſeth.

Will euer acts, and wit contemplates ſtill,

And as from witte the power of wiſedome riſeth,

All other vertues daughters are of will.

Idem.

Will is the Prince, and wit the counſellor,

Which doth for common good in councell ſit,

And when witte is reſolu'd, will lends her power,

To execute what is deuiſ'd by witte.

I. Dauies.

Will is as free as any Emperour,

Nought can reſtraine her gentle libertie,

No tyrant nor no torrent hath the power

[[Page 302]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=158)To make vs
will when wee vnwilling bee.

Idem.

Euen as the will ſhould goodneſſe truely know,

VVe haue a will which that true good ſhould chooſe

Although will oft, when wit falſe formes doth ſhow,

Take ill for good, and good for ill refuſe.

Idem.

It liues not in our power to loue or hate,

For will in vs is ouer-rul'd by fate.

Ch. Marlow.

A ſtronger hand reſtraines our wilfull powers,

A will muſt rule aboue this will of ours,

Not following what our vaine deſires doe woe,

For vertues ſake, but what wee onely doe.

M. Dr.

—Headleſſe will true iudgement doth enſnare.

Idem.

Selfe-will doth frowne, when honeſt zeale reproues,

Idem.

Whereas our actions meaſure no regard,

Our lawleſſe will is made his owne reward.

M. Dra.

—With a world of miſchiefes and offence,

Ʋnbridled will rebelles againſt the ſence.

D. Lodge.

Hee leaſt ſhould liſt that may doe what he will.

S. Dan.

### 1.178. Wiſedome.

Our God himſelfe for wiſedome moſt is prayſed,

[[Page 303]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=158)And men to
God thereby are nigheſt rayſed.

Ed. Spencer.

Wiſedome doth warne, whilſt foe is in the gate.

To ſtay the ſtep, ere forced to retreate.

Idem.

VViſedome muſt iudge twixt men apt to amend,

And mindes incurable borne to offend.

S. D.

—In daunger wiſedome doth aduiſe,

In humble termes to reconcile our foes.

D. Lodge.

—Wiſedome and the ſight of heauenly things,

Shines not ſo cleere as earthly vanities.

G. Chapman.

Tis ſayd a wiſe man all miſhaps withſtands,

For though by ſtarres wee borne to miſchiefes are,

Yet prudence bailes vs quite from carefull bands.

M. of M.

Fore-ſight doth ſtill on all aduantage lie.

Wiſe men muſt giue place to neceſsitie.

M. Dr.

— A wiſeman poore

Is like a ſacred Booke that's neuer read,

T'himſelfe hee liues, and to all elſe ſeemes dead:

This age thinkes better of a gilded foole,

Then of thred bare ſaint in wiſedomes ſchoole.

Th. Dekkar.

VViſe men let faults ore-paſſe, they cannot mend.

Ch. Middle.

VVho can themſelues beware by others coſts,

May bee accounted well among the wiſe.

S. I. H.

[[Page 304]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=159)

—Whatſoeuer Starres ſeeme to importune,

Wiſedome predominates both fate and fortune.

Ch. Fitz Griffon.

### 1.179. VVit.

The witte the pupill of the ſoules cleere eye,

And in mans world the onely ſhining ſtarre,

Lookes in the mirror of the phantaſie,

Where all the gathering of the ſences ate,

From thence this power the ſhape of things abſtract [...]

And them within her paſsiue part receiues,

Which are inlightened by that part which acts,

And ſo the forme of ſingle things receiues:

But after by diſcourſing to and fro,

Anticipating and comparing things

She doth all vniuerſall natures know,

And all effects into their cauſes bring.

Our witte is giuen Almightie God to know,

Our will is giuen to loue him being knowne,

But God could not bee knowne to vs below,

But by his works, which through the ſence are knowne.

I. Dauis.

Wit is the mindes cheefe iudge, which doth controle,

Of fancies Court the iudgements falſe and vaine,

Will, holdes the royall ſcepter in the ſoule,

And on the paſsions of the heart doth raigne.

Idem.

Emulation the proud nurſe of witte.

S. D.

—Wit and learning are two Angelles wings,

[[Page 305]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=159)By which
meane men ſoare vp to mightie things.

Ch. Middl.

Wit is with boldneſſe prompt, with terror daunted,

And grace is ſooner got of dames then graunted.

Ed. Spencer.

Some looſe their wit with loue, ſome with ambition

Some running to the ſea great wealth to get,

Some following Lords and men of high condition,

Some in fayre iewelles, rich and coſtly ſet.

One hath deſire to prooue a rare magician,

Others with Poetrie their witte forget:

Another thinkes to bee an Alchimiſt,

Till all hee ſpent, and hee his number miſt.

S. I. H.

Mans wit is monſtrous, when the ſame from vertue doth decline.

W. Warner.

Mans witte doth build for time but to deuoure,

But Vertue's free from time and fortunes power.

M. Dr.

The wit not hurt, becauſe not vſed more,

Growes dull and farre leſſe toward then before.

—Wits ambition longeth to the beſt,

For it deſires in endleſſe bliſſe to dwell.

I. Dauis.

Beſt loues are loſt for wit, when men blame fortune.

G. Chapman.

— Careleſſe wit is wanton bewties page.

D. Lodge.

The fineſt wittes are ſooneſt ſnarde with loue.

Th. Achellye.

[[Page 306]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=160)

A ſetled braine is worth a world of witte.

Th. Storer.

Wits want makes men deſirous to ſeeme wiſe.

### 1.180. Woe.

Woe all in blacke within her hands did beare,

The fatall torches of a funerall,

Her cheekes were wet, diſperſed was her hayre,

Her voyce was ſhrill (yet lothſome therewithal)

D. Lodge.

Short time ſeemes long in ſorrowes ſharp ſuſtaining,

Though woe bee heauie, yet it ſeldome ſleepes,

And they that watch ſee time how ſlow it creepes.

W. Shakeſpeare.

—Fellowſhip in woe, doth woe aſſwage,

As palmers that make ſhort their pilgrimage.

Idem.

Tis double death to drowne in ken of ſhore,

He ten times pines, that pines behoulding food:

To ſee the ſalue doth make the wound ake more,

Great griefes greeue moſt at that would doe it good,

Deere woes rowle forwarde like a gentle flood:

Who being ſtopt, the bounden bankes ore flowes,

Greefe dallied with, nor law nor limmit knowes.

Idem.

Diſtreſſe likes dumps, when time is kept with teares.

Idem.

For ſtronger woe we hardly long may wreſt,

The depth of griefe with words is ſounded leaſt.

M. Dra.

[[Page 307]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=160)

—The Painter

VVho thought his colours pale could not declare

The ſpeciall woe King Agamemnon bare,

When ſacrificed was his onely rage,

With bend of blacke he bound the fathers face.

Th. Hudſon.

### 1.181. Words.

— Words

Windie atturnies of our clyent woes,

Ayery ſucceeders of inteſtate ioyes,

Poore breathing Orators of miſeries,

Let them haue ſcope, though what it doth impart

Helpe not at all, yet doth it eaſe the heart.

Ʋ Ʋ. Sh.

Words are the tennants of an itching toy.

D. Lodge.

Alluſion of words is no ſure ground,

For one thereon a ſteddie worke to found.

One word of woe another after traineth.

S Ph. Sydney.

—Few words ſhall fit the treſpaſſe beſt,

Where no excuſe can giue the fault amending.

W. Sh.

Deepe ſounds make better noyſe then ſhallow fords,

And ſorrow ebbes being blown with wind of words.

W. Sh.

Words are but winde, why coſt they then ſo much,

The giltie kicke when they too ſmartly to [...]ch.

Idem.

Forth irreturnable flies the ſpoken word,

[[Page 308]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=161)Bee it in
ſcoffe, in earneſt, or in bourd,

VVithout returne and vnreceiu'd it hangs,

And at the takers mercie or rigor ſtands:

Which if hee ſowrely wreſt, with wrathfull cheare,

The ſhiuering word turnes to the hearers feare:

If friendly courteſie doe the word expound,

To th'ſpeakers comfort quickly it doth redound.

Idem.

Smoothe words diſſolue hard ſtones, faire words in­force

Pittie in flintie hearts.

Ch. Middl.

Through the world if it were ſought,

Faire words enow a man ſhould finde,

They bee good cheape, they coſt right nought,

Their ſubſtance is but onely winde:

But well to ſay, and ſo to meane,

That ſweete accord is ſeldome ſeene.

S. Th. W.

— Words well plac't moue things were neuer thought.

G. Chapman.

Euen as the vapour which the fire repelles,

Turnes not to earth, but in mid-ayre dwelles,

Where while it hangs, if Boreas froſtie flawes,

With rigor rattle it: not to raine it thawes,

But thunder, lightning, ratling, hayle, or ſnow,

Sends downe to earth, whence firſt it roſe below.

But if faire Phebus with his countenance ſweete

Reſolue it, downe the dew or Manna ſleete:

The Manna dew that in the Eſterne lands,

Excelles the labour of the Bees ſmall hands,

[[Page 309]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=161)Elſe for
her Memnon, gray Auroraes teares,

On the earth it ſtilleth the partner of her feares,

Or ſendeth ſweet ſhowres to glad their mother earth

Whence firſt they tooke their firſt in conſtant birth.

To thoſe great greefes ill taken words do grow,

Of words well taken ſuch delights do flow.

M. of M.

— Men do fouleſt when they fineſt ſpeake.

S. Daniell.

They waſh a Moore, they ſtriue to drie the ſeas,

And plaine proude Atlas, that intend to pleaſe

By filthy woords, by rayling, and detraction,

Proper to Momus, and his hatefull faction:

For when they thinke they haue deſerued moſt,

Alas ſayth wiſedome, all the toyle is loſt.

D. Lodge.

Few words well coucht, doe moſt content the wiſe.

R. Greene.

Raſh words flow from an vnaduiſed mind.

Who once hath paſt the boundes of honeſtie

In earneſt deedes, may paſſe it well in words.

G. G.

Haue care to whom, of whom, and what to ſpeake, though ſpeech be true

That miſſe made Phoebus contrarie his rauēs ſwan-like hue.

W. W.

If ſo the crow would feaſt him without prate,

More meate hee ſhould receiue, leſſe brawle and hate

A foole hee is that comes to preach and prate,

When men with ſwords their right & wrong debate.

— Words well diſpoſed,

Haue ſecret power t'appeaſe inflamed rage.

Ed. Sp.

[[Page 310]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=162)

### 1.182. Women.

— Women bee

Framde with the ſame parts of the mind as we,

Nay nature triumpht in their beauties birth,

And women made the glorie of the earth:

The life of bewtie, in whoſe ſupple breaſts,

And in her faireſt lodging vertue reſts,

VVhoſe towring thoughts attended with remorſe,

Do make their faireneſſe be of greater force.

I. Weeuer.

What art ſo deepe, what ſcience is ſo hie,

Vnto the which women haue not attain'd,

Who liſt in ſtories old to looke, may trie

And find my ſpeech herein nor falſe nor fain'd,

And though of late they ſeeme not to come nie

The praiſe their ſex in former times haue gain'd.

Doubtleſſe the fault is either in back-biters,

Or want of skill or iudgement in their writers.

Idem.

Among the many rare and ſpeciall gifts,

That in the female ſexe are found to ſitte,

This one is chiefe, that they at meereſt ſhifts,

Giue beſt aduiſe, and ſhew moſt readie witte,

But man except hee chewes and thinks, and fifts,,

How euerie part may aunſwere to their fit,

By raſh aduiſe doth often ouer-ſhoote him,

And doth accept the things that doe no [...]boote him.

Idem.

Thoſe vertues that in women merit prayſe,

Are ſober ſhowes without, chaſte thoughts within,

[[Page 311]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=162)Truth
ſayth, and due obedience to their make,

And of their children honeſt care to take.

S. I. H.

Let woolues and beaſts be cruel in their kind,

But women meeke, and haue relenting mindes.

M. Drayton.

Not women, but our wilfulneſſe doth work our woe vnreſt

Though beautie, loue, and they beare fault, we may abuſe the beſt.

W. W.

— Men haue Marble, women waxen minds

And therefore are they form'd as Marble will,

The weake oppreſt, th'impreſsion of ſtrange kindes,

Is form'd in them by force, by fraude, or skill,

Then call not them the Authors of their ill,

No more then waxe ſhall bee accounted euill,

Wherein is ſtampt the ſemblance of the diuell.

Their ſmootheneſſe like a goodly champaine plaine,

Laies open all the little wormes that creepe,

In men as in a rough growen groue remaine,

Caue-keeping euilles, that obſcurely ſleepe,

Through criſtall walles each little moule will peepe,

Though men can couer minds with bold ſtern looks

Pale womens faces are their owne faults Bookes.

No man inueyes againſt the withered flower,

But chides rough winter that the flower hath kild,

Not that deuourd, but that which doth deuour,

Is woorthie blame, O let it not be hild,

Poore womens faults, that they are ſo fulfil'd,

With mens abuſes thoſe proude lores to blame,

Make weake-made women tenants to their ſhame.

W. Shakeſpeare.

[[Page 312]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=163)

Bee not therefore too proude and full of ſcorne,

O women-kind, that men come of your ſeede,

The fragrant Roſe growes on the pricking thorne,

The Lillie ſayre comes of a filthie weede,

In loathſome ſoyle men ſow the wholſome corne,

The baſeſt mould the faireſt flower doth breede,

Vngratefull, falſe, craftie you are, and cruell,

Borne of our burning hell to bee the fuell.

S. I. H.

Baſe bullion for the ſtampe ſake wee allow,

Euen ſo for mens impreſsion doe wee you,

By which alone our reuerend fathers ſay,

Women receiue perfection euerie way.

Ch. Marlow.

Their Vertues mount like billowes to the skies,

And vaniſh ſtraight out of the gazers eyes,

Hate and diſdaine is painted in theyr eyes,

Deceit and treaſon in their boſome lies.

G. Chapman.

Women were made for this intent, to put vs vnto paine,

Yet ſure I thinke they are a pleaſure to the mind,

A ioy which man can neuer want, as nature hath aſ­ſign'd.

Idem,

Extreamely mad the man I ſurely deeme,

That weenes with watch and hard reſtraint to ſtay

A womans will, which is diſpoſ'd to goe aſtray.

Ed. Spencer.

In vaine hee feares that which hee cannot ſhunne,

For who wots not that womens ſubtilties

Can gnilen Argus, when ſhee liſt miſdoone,

It is not iron bands nor hundred eyes,

[[Page 313]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=163)Nor brazen
walles, nor many wakefull ſpyes,

That can with-hold her wilfull wandring feete,

But faſt good will with gentle curteſies,

And timely ſeruice to her pleaſures meeke,

May her perhaps containe that elſe would algates fleete.

Idem.

Such is the crueltie of women-kind,

When they haue ſhaken off the ſhame-fac't band,

With which wiſe nature did them ſtrongly bind,

T'obey the heſts of mans wel-ruling hand,

That then all rule and reaſon they withſtand,

To purchaſe a licencious libertie.

But vertuous women wiſely vnderſtand,

That they were borne to baſe humilitie,

Vnleſſe the heauens them lift to lawfull ſoueraintie.

S. Ph. Sydney.

Why? what be women? women, geld the latter ſillable,

Then are they nothing more then woe, their names re­maine doth tell,

W. W.

Take away weakeneſſe, and take women too.

S. D.

Women may fall, when there's no ſtrength in men.

W. Sh.

They melt with words, as waxe againſt the ſunne,

So weake is many womens modeſtie,

For what ſomtimes they moſt would ſeeme to ſheeld

Another time vnaskte poore ſoules they yeeld.

Ch. Middleton.

— A woman

Loues to be woed of a man, thou knowſt well Thirſis, a woman

Runs, and yet ſo runs, as though ſhe deſir'd to be out-run

[[Page 314]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=164) Saies no,
no, yet ſo as no no, ſeems to be no, no,

Striues, & yet ſo ſtriues, as though ſhe deſird to be van­quiſht,

Woman's like to a ſhade, that flies, yet lies by the ſubiect,

Like to a Bee, that neuer ſtriues if ſting be remooued.

A. Fraunce.

In womens mouthes no is no negatiue.

I. W.

Their yea, or no, when as they ſweare they loue or loue vs moſt,

Beleeue who liſt, ſoone be they got, as ſodainely are loſt.

W. W.

A womans loue is riuer-like, which ſtopt will ouer­flow,

And when the current finds no let, it often falles too low.

Idem.

Varietie of men to court a woman is her pride,

Then which the vanity of men is nothing leſſe eſpide

What are to vs but common hurts,

Thoſe common hopes they giue,

If then their loue doth die to vs,

VVhen ours to them doth liue.

Idem.

— VVomen neuer

Loue beautie in their ſexe, but enuie euer.

G. Chapman.

There cannot bee a greater clogge to man,

Then to be wearie of a wanton woman.

S. I. H.

—What more ſpight can be a woman told,

Then one ſhould ſay ſhe looketh foule and old.

Idem.

—Bee ſhee baſe or hie,

A womans eye doth guide her wit, & not her wit her eye.

W. W.

Women are moſt wonne, as when men merit leaſt,

[[Page 315]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=164)If merit
looke not well, loue bids ſtand by,

Loues proper leſſon is to pleaſe the eye.

G. Ch▪

He water plowes, and ſoweth in the ſand

And hopes the flickering wind with net to hold,

Who hath his hopes layd on a womans hand.

S. P. S

— Women by kind are mutable euer,

Soone hot, and ſoone cold, like, and miſlike in a moment,

Change as a weather-cocke, and all as light as a fether.

A. Fr.

Women haue tongues of craft, and hearts of guile,

They will, they will not, fooles that on them luſt,

For in their ſpeech is death, hell in their ſmile.

Ed. Fairfax.

One woman with another may do much.

Th. Ach.

Like vntund golden ſtrings all women are,

Which long time lie vntoucht, will harſhly iarre.

Ch. Marlow.

Diſcurteous women natures faireſt ill,

The woe of man, that firſt createſt curſe,

Baſe female ſexe, ſprung from blacke Ates loynes,

Proude, diſdainefull, cruell, and vniuſt,

Whoſe words are ſhaded with inchaunting wiles,

Worſe then Med [...]ſ [...], mateth all our mindes,

And in their hearts ſits ſhameleſſe trecherie,

Turning a truthleſſe vile circumference,

O could my fury paint their furies forth,

For hell, no hell compared to their hearts▪

Too ſimple diuelles, to conceiue their arts:

Borne to be plagues vnto the thoughts of men,

Brought for eternall peſtilence to the worlde.

R Greene.

Women are kind by kind, and coy for faſhion.

### 1.183. Of Wrath,

—Fierce reuenging wrath

Rides on a Lyon, loth for to bee led,

And in his ſtand a burning brand hee had,

The which hee brandiſhed about his head,

His eyes did hurle foorth ſparkles fierie redde,

And ſtared ſterne on all that him beheld,

As aſhes pale of hew, and ſeeming dead,

And on his dagger ſtill his hand hee held,

Trembling through haſtie rage when choller in him ſweld.

Ed. Spencer.

— Boyling wrath, ſterne, cruell, ſwift, & raſh,

That like a boare her teeth doth grinde and gnaſh,

Whoſe hayre dooth ſtare like briſtled po [...]cupine,

Who ſometimes rowles her gaſtly glowing eyene,

And ſometimes fixly on the ground doth glaunce,

Now bleake, then bloudy in her countenance,

Rauing and rayling with a hideous ſound,

Clapping her hands, ſtamping againſt the ground,

Bearing Bocconi, fire, and ſword, to ſlay

And murder all that for her pittie pray,

Banning her ſelfe to bane her enemie,

Diſdaining death, prouided others die,

Like falling towres o're-turned by the wind,

[[Page 317]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=165)That
breake themſelues on that they vndergrinde.

I. Sylueſter.

Full many miſchiefes follow cruell wrath,

As horrid bloud-ſhed, and tumultuous ſtrife,

Vnmanly murther, and vnthriftie ſcath,

Bitter deſpight, and rancors ruſtie knife,

And fretting greefe, the enemie of life,

All theſe and many euilles more haunt ire,

The ſwelling ſpleene, and frenzie raging rife,

The ſhaking palſie, and Saint Fraunces fire.

Ed. Spencer.

When men with wrath and ſudden paines of ire,

Suffer themſelues to bee o're-whelm'd and drownd,

And hot reuenge that burnes l [...]ke flaming fire,

Moo [...]es hearts to hurt, or tongs or hands to wound,

Though after to a mend, if they deſire,

Yet place of pardon ſeldome can be found.

S. I. H.

What iron band, or what ſharpe hard-mouth'd bitte,

What chaine of Diamond (if ſuch might bee)

Can bridle wrathfulneſſe, and conquer it,

And keepe him in his bounds and due degree.

Idem.

— Haſtie wrath and heedleſſe hazardie,

Doe breede repentance and laſting infamie.

Ed. Spencer.

Poore ſillie lambes the Lion neuer teares,

The feeble Mouſe may lie among great Beares,

But wrath of man his rancour to requite,

Forgets all reaſon, ruth, and mercie quite.

M. of M.

[[Page 318]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=166)

— He is a mad man that doth ſeeke

Occaſion to wrath and cauſe of ſtrife,

She comes vnſought, and ſhunned followes eke:

Happy, who can abſtaine when rancor rife

Kindles reuenge and threates his cruell knife:

Woe neuer wants when euery cauſe is caught,

And raſh occa [...]ion makes vnquiet life.

Ed. Spencer.

Be not moody in thy wrath, but pawze ere fiſt be bent,

Oft Phillips ſonne did raſhly ſtrike and ſodenly repent.

W. Warner.

Achilles when with counterfaited creſt,

He ſaw Patroclus bleeding all the way,

To kill his killer was not ſatisfied,

Except he hald and tare him all beſide.

Fret not at it the more,

When Aiax ſtormed them from him,

The prize Vliſſes bore.

Rage, wanne and pale vpon a Tygre ſat

Gnawing vpon the bones of mangled men,

Nought can he view but he repines thereat▪

### 1.184. World,

The antique world in his firſt flowring youth,

Found no defect in his creators grace,

But with glad thanks and vnreprooued truth,

The gifts of ſoueraigne bountie did embrace,

Like angelles life was then mans happie caſe:

[[Page 319]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=166)But later
ages pride like corne-fed ſteede,

Abvſde her plentie and fatſwoln increaſe,

To all licencious luſt, and gan exceede,

Ed. Spencer.

VVhen arked Noah, and ſeuen with him the emptie worlds remaine,

And that both mā beaſt & all did multiply with ſtore

I take this world to bee but as a ſtage,

Ʋ Ʋhere net-maskt men do play their perſonages,

Tis but a murmur and a pleaſant ſhew,

Syth ouer all ſtrange vanities do flow.

I. Sylueſter.

The world to the circumference of heauen,

Is as a ſmall poynt in Geometrie,

Ʋ Ʋhoſe greatneſſe is ſo little that a leſſe

Cannot bee made.

Th. Dekkar

The firſt world bleſſed was with heauenly fauours,

And the laſt curſt with painefull helliſh labours.

Ch. Middl.

O vaine worlds glorie, and vncertaine ſtate,

Of all that liues on face of ſinfull earth,

VVhich from their firſt vntill their vtmoſt date,

Taſte no one howre of happineſſe or mirth,

But like as is the ingate of their birth.

They crying creepe out of their mothers wombe,

So wayling backe, goe to their carefull tombe.

Ed. Spencer.

Ah wretched world, the den of wretchedneſſe,

Deformd with filth and foule iniquitie,

Ah wretched world, the houſe of heauineſſe,

Fild with the wreakes of mortall miſerie,

Oh wretched world and all that is therein,

The vaſſals of Gods wrath, and ſlaues to ſinne.

Idem.

— O worlds inconſtancie,

That which is firme doth flit and fall away,

And that is flitting doth abide and ſtay.

Idem.

Muſt not the world wend in his common courſe,

From good and bad, and then from bad to wourſe,

From worſt vnto that which is worſt of all,

And then returne vnto his former fall▪

Who will not ſuffer the ſtormie time,

Where will hee liue vntill the luſtie prime?

Idem.

This golden age to yron doth decline,

As ſummer vnto winter muſt reſigne.

D. Lodge.

The firſt and riper world of men and skill,

Yeelds to our latter time for three inuentions,

Myraculouſly wee write, wee ſayle, wee kill,

As neither auncient ſcrowle nor ſtorie mentions.

Print. The firſt hath opened learnings old concealed

And obſcurde arts reſtored to the light:

Loadſt. The ſecond hidden countries hath reueald,

And ſent Chriſts Goſpel to each liuing wight.

Theſe we commend, but oh what needeth more,

Guns. To teach death more skill then he had before.

Th. Bastard.

Take moyſture from the ſea, take colour frō his kind,

Before the world deuoyd of change thou finde.

— All that in this world is great or gay,

Doth as a vapour vaniſh and decay.

Ed. Spencer.

This is the reſt the vaine world lendes,

To end in death, that all things ends.

S. Daniell.

All men are willing with the world to hault,

But no man takes delight to know his fault.

D. Lodge.

A die, a drab, and filthie broking Knaues,

Are the worlds wide mouthes, al-deuouring graues▪

I. Marston.

Nothing doth the world ſo full of miſchiefe fill.

But want of feeling one-anothers will.

G. Chapman.

—Not by that which is the world now deemeth,

(As it was woont) but by that ſame that ſeemeth.

Ed. Spencer.

There neuer ſhall bee any age ſo cleere,

But in her ſmoothe face ſhall ſome faults appeare.

Th. Middl.

The world muſt end, for men are ſo accurſt,

Vnleſſe God end it ſooner, men will firſt.

### 1.185. Youth.

Youth is a bubble blowen vp with a breath,

VVhoſe wit is weaknes, and whoſe wage is death,

Whoſe way is wildnes, and whoſe Inne penance,

[[Page 322]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=168)And ſtoope
gallant age, the hoaſt of greeuance.

Ed. Spencer.

If crooked age accounteth youth his ſpring,

The ſpring the fayreſt ſeaſon of the yeere,

Enricht with flowers, and ſweetes, and many a thing

That fayre and glorious to the eye appeares:

It fits that youth the ſpring of man ſhould bee,

Richt with ſuch flowers as vertue getteth thee.

R. Greene.

For noble youth there is no thing ſo meete

As learning is, to know the good from ill,

To know the tongues, and perfectly endite,

And of the lawes to haue the perfect skill

Things to reforme as right and iuſtice will:

For honour is ordained for no cauſe,

But to ſee right maintained by the lawes.

M. of M.

The youth of Princes haue no boundes for ſinne,

Vnleſſe themſelues doe make the bounds within.

S. Daniell.

Moſt true it is, as veſſels of firſt licours euer taſte,

Loue ſeaſoned ſo with ſweetnes of youth, the ſame dooth euer laſt.

W. Warner.

Like as the veſſell euer beares a taſte

Of the ſame iuice wherewith it firſt was fil'd,

And as in fruitfull ground the ſeede growes faſt,

That firſt is ſowen after the ground is till'd:

So looke what lore in youthfull yeeres is plaſt,

By that they grow the worſe or better willed,

When as they came to manly age and ſtature,

Sith education is another nature.

S. I. H.

[[Page 323]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=168)

The tunne retaineth long the taſte and ſent,

Of that pure licour which at firſt it hent,

And what impreſsion one in youth retaine,

In age our reaſon hardly will reſtraine,

D. Lodge.

— What by vaine example youth conceiues,

The ſame for lawfull daily he receiues.

Idem.

Age is deformed, youth vnkind,

Wee ſcorne their bodyes, they our mindes.

Th. Bastard.

The youth are fooliſh hardy, or leſſe hardy thē they ought

Effeminate, fantaſticke, in few not few, are nought.

W. Warner.

—Forward ſinne in raines of fooliſh rage,

Leaues heedleſſe youth inchaind his captiue page.

D. Lodge.

—Youth doth deſerue by might,

But old age by good counſell and fore-ſight.

Idem.

— Youth may loue, and yongmen may admire,

If old age cannot, yet it will deſire,

I. Weeuer.

In grained habits died with often dips

Are not ſo ſoone diſcoloured, yong ſlippes

New ſet, are eaſily mou'd and pluckt away,

But elder rootes clippe faſter in the clay.

I. Murſton.

The plow-man firſt his land doth dreſſe and turne,

And makes it apt or ere the ſeede he ſow,

VVhereby hee is full like to reape the corne,

[[Page 324]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=169)VVhere
otherwiſe no ſeede but weed ſhould grow:

By which example men may eaſily know,

When youth haue wealth before they can well vſe it,

It is no woonder though they doe abuſe it.

M. of M.

Reform the euē to day, vnapt to day, leaſt apt to morrow

Youth aptly offers vertues, ſuch as yeares vnaptly borrow

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋ.

Looke what wee haue when youth is moſt in prime,

That ſhall wee want in age by courſe of time.

Th. Churchyard.

### 1.186. The diuiſion of the day naturall. Mediae noctis inclinatio.

Night was farre ſpent, and now in Ocean deepe,

Orion flying faſt from hiſsing ſnake,

His flaming head did haſten for to ſteepe.

Ed. Sp.

By this th'eternall lamps wherewith high Ioue,

Doth light the lower world, were halfe yſpent,

And the moyſt daughters of huge Atlas ſtroue

Into th'ocean deep to driue their wearie droue.

Idē.

— The gentle humorous night,

Implyes her middle courſe, and the ſharpe eaſt,

Breathes on my ſpirit with his fierie ſteedes.

G. Chapman.

The ſilent night that long had ſoiourned,

Now gan to caſt her ſable mantle off,

And now the ſleepie waine-man ſoftly droue

[[Page 325]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=169)His ſlow-
pac't teeme that long had trauailed.

Th. Kyd.

### 1.187. Gallicinium.

By this the Northerne Wagoner had ſet

His ſeuen-fold teeme behind the ſtedfaſt ſtarre,

That was in Ocean waues, yet neuer wet,

But firme is fixt, and ſendeth light from farre,

To all that in the wide deepe wandring are,

And cheereful chauntte cleere with his notes ſhrill,

Had warned once that Phebus fierie carre,

[...] haſte was climing vp to Eſterne hill,

Full enuious that the night ſo long his roome did f [...]ill

Ed. Spencer.

What time the natiue Bel-man of the night,

The bird that warned Peter of his fall,

Firſt rings his ſiluer bel to each ſleeping wight,

That ſhould their mindes vp to deuotion call.

Idem.

The cheerefull cocke, the ſad nights trumpeter,

Wayting vpon the riſing of the ſunne,

Doth ſing to ſee how Cynthia ſhrinks her horne,

Where Clitia takes her progreſſe to the Eaſt,

VVhere wringing weſt with drops of ſiluer dew,

Her wonted teares of loue ſhe doth renew,

The wandering ſwallow with her broken ſong,

The countrie wench vnto her worke awakes,

Whilſt Cytherea ſighing, walks to ſeeke,

Her murdered loue tranſformed to a roſe,

Whom though ſhe ſee, to croppe ſhee kindly feares

But kiſsing ſighes, and dewes him with her teares.

Th. Kyd.

[[Page 326]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=170)

Now ere the purple dawning yet did ſpring,

The ioyfull Larke began to ſtretch her wing,

And now the cocke the mornings trumpeter,

Plaid hunts vp, for the day-ſtarre to appeare,

Downe ſlideth Phebe from her criſtall chayre,

S'daigning to lend her light vnto the ayre.

M. Drayton.

### 1.188. Diliculum.

At laſt fayre Heſperus in higheſt skie,

Had ſpent his lamp, & brought forth dawning light.

Ed. Spencer.

The night growen old, her blacke head waxen gray,

Sure ſhepheards ſigne that morn wil ſoon fetch day.

S. Ph. Sydney.

It was the time when gainſt the breaking day,

Rebellious night yet ſtroue and ſtill repined,

For in the eaſt appeares the morning gray,

And yet ſome lampes in Ioues high pallace ſhined.

Ed. Fairfax.

By this Apolloes golden harpe beganne

To ſend forth muſicke to the Ocean,

Which watchfull Heſperos no ſooner heard,

But hee the day bright bearing carre prepar'd,

And ranne before, as harkenger of light,

And with his flaming beames  [...]ockt vgly night.

Ch. Marlow.

—Lycaons ſonne,

The hardy plough-ſwaine vnto mightie Ioue,

Hath trac'd his ſiluer furrowes in the heauen,

And turning home his ouer-watched teeme,

[[Page 327]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=170)Giues
leaue vnto Apolloes chariot.

R. Greene.

Nights candles are burnt out, and iocond day,

Stands tiptoe on the miſtie mountaines top.

Ʋ Ʋ. Sh.

Loe now the gentle Larke wearie of reſt,

From his moyſt cabynet mounts vp on hie,

And wakes the morning from whoſe ſiluer breaſt,

The ſunne ariſeth in his maieſtie:

VVho doth the world ſo gloriouſly behold,

That Cedar tops and hilles ſeem'd burniſht gold.

Idem.

### 1.189. Mane▪

The ioyous day gan earlie to appeare,

And fayre Aurora fro her dewy bed

Of aged Tithon gan her ſelfe to reare

With roſie cheekes, for ſhame as bluſhing red.

Ed. Spencer.

Now when the roſie-fingred morning fayre,

Wearie of aged Tithons ſaffron bed,

Had ſpread her purple robe through dewie ayre,

And the high hilles Titan diſcouered,

The royall Virgin ſhooke off drowſie bed.

Idem.

Now ſullen night with ſlow ſad pace deſcended

To vgly hell, when loe the bluſhing morrow

Lends light to all faire eyes that light will borrow.

W. Sh.

[[Page 328]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=171)

Soone as the morrow ſaire with purple beames,

Diſperſt the ſhadowes of the miſtie night,

And Titan playing on the eaſterne ſtreames,

Gan cleare the dewie ayre with ſpringing light.

Ed. Spencer.

The dewie Roſe at morne had with her hayres,

In ſundrie ſorts the Indian clime adornde,

And now her eyes apparelled in teares,

The loſſe of louely Memnon long had mornde.

D. Lodge.

The gaudie morne out of her golden ſleepe

Awakte, and little birdes vncagde gan ſing,

To welcome home the bride-groome of the ſea.

G. Peele.

The gray-eyde morne ſmiles on the frowning night,

Cheering the eaſterne cloudes with ſtreams of light,

And darkeneſſe flected like a drunkard reeles,

From forth dayes path-way made by Titans wheels.

W. Sh.

Now had the morne eſpide her louers ſteedes,

VVhereat ſhee ſtarts, puts on her purple weede,

And red for anger that hee ſtayd ſo long,

All headlong throwes her ſelfe the cloudes among.

Ch. Marlow.

As ſoon as morning her ſhining haires fro the mountains

Had ſhewen forth & driuen all ſtar-light quite fro the heauens.

A. Fraunce.

Faire Aurora betimes by the daies break roſe from her huſband

Husband, old & cold, & draue back clouds frō Olympas

Making way to the ſun, taking her way to the younker,

Braue yonker Cephalus whom faire Aurora deſired.

Idem.

[[Page 329]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=171)

Now was the time when as Aurora faire,

Began to ſhew the world her golden head,

And looke abroade to take the coole freſh ayre,

Iealous Tithono lying ſtill in bedde.

S. I. H.

The ſable night diſlodgd and now beganne,

Auroraes vſher with a windie fanne,

Sweetely to ſhake the woods on euerie ſide,

The whilſt his miſtreſſe like a ſtately bride,

With flowers, with gemmes, and Indian gold doth ſpangle

Her louely locks her louers looks to tangle,

VVhen paſsing through the aire in mantle blue,

With ſiluer fringe ſhee drops the pearlie dew,

With her goes Abram out.

I. Sylueſter.

The roſie fringed morne with gladſome ray,

Roſe to her taske from old Tithonas lap.

Ed. Fairfax.

The night beginnes bee angrie when ſhee ſees

She can diſtill no ſleepe in louers eyes,

Toſsing her ſelfe among the cloudes now hath

Sent the red morne as harauld of her wrath,

VVhoſe louer Phebus riſing from his bed,

VVith dewie mantle hath the world or'e-ſpread,

Shaking his treſſes our Neptunes ebbe:

And giuing tincture to the ſpiders webbe,

Theſe fayre nimphs roſe, ſeeing the light did call.

I. Weeuer.

Aurora bright her criſtall gates vnbatr'd,

And bridegroome like ſtept forth the glorious ſunne

Ed. Fairfax.

[[Page 330]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=172)

The dewie treſsie morning newly wake,

With golden tinſell ſcarſe had crownd her brow,

Riding in triumph on the Ocean lake,

Embelliſhing the hony-fringed bowes.

M. Drayton.

The purple morning left her crimſin bed,

And dond her robes of pure vermillion hue,

Her amber locks ſhee crownd with roſes red,

In Edens flowry gardens gathered new.

Ed. Fairfax.

### 1.190. Soles Ortus.

At laſt the golden Orientall gate

Of greateſt heauen gan to open fayre,

And Phoebus freſh as bridegroome to her mate,

Came dauncing forth, ſhaking his dewie haire,

And hurles his gliſtering beames through gloomie ayre.

Ed. Spencer.

The fierie ſunne was mounted vp on hight,

Vp to the heauenly towres, and ſhot each where

Out of his golden chariot gliſtering light:

And faire Aurora with her roſie hayre,

The hatefull darkneſſe now had put to flight.

Idem.

The golden ſunne roſe from the ſiluer waue,

And with his beames enameld euerie grene.

Ed. Fairfax.

The ſnoring ſnout of reſtleſſe Phlegon blew,

Hot on the Indes, which did the day renew

With ſcarlet skie.

Th. Hadſon.

[[Page 331]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=172)

### 1.191. Meridies.

Hyperion throwing forth his beames full oft,

Into the higheſt toppe of heauen gan clime,

And the world parting by an equall lot,

Did ſhed his whirling flames on either ſide,

As the great Ocean doth himſelfe diuide.

Ed. Spencer.

When as the ſunne towred in heauens head,

Downe from the ſiluer mountaines of the skie,

Bent his bright chariot on the glaſsie bed,

Fayre Criſtall gilded with his glorious eye,

Fearing ſome vſurpation in his ſted,

Or leaſt his loue ſhould too long dalliance ſpie,

Tweene him and Virgo, whoſe attractiue face,

Had newly made him leaue the Lions chace,

In that ſame middayes hower &c.

I· Markham.

— Golden Phoebus now that mounted hie

From fierie wheeles of his fayre chariot,

Hurled his beames ſo ſcorching cruell hot,

That liuing creature mote it not abide.

Ed. Spencer.

In higheſt way of heauen the ſunne did ryde,

Progreſsing from fayre twins in golden place,

Hauing no maske of cloudes before his face,

But ſtreaming forth his heate in cheefeſt pride.

S. Ph. Sydney.

### 1.192. Solis Occaſus.

Now gan the golden Phoebus for to ſteepe,

[[Page 332]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=173)His fierie
face in billowes of the weſt,

And his faint Steedes watred in Ocean deepe,

Whilſt from their iournall labours they doe reſt.

Ed. Spencer.

—Loe the great Automedon of day,

In Iſis ſtreame his golden locks doth ſteepe,

Sad euen her duſky mantle doth diſplay,

Light flying fouls the poſts of night doe ſport them,

And cheerefull looking Phoebe doth comfort them.

D. Lodge.

By this the welked Phoebus gan auaile,

His wearie waine and now the froſtie night,

Her mantle blacke through heauen gan ouerhaile,

Ed. Spencer.

Such loue as Phoebus from the coloured skie,

Did headlong driue his horſes toward the weſt,

To ſuffer horned Luna for ro prye,

Amidſt the duſky darke.

D. Lodge.

When as the Sun hales towa [...]ds the weſterne ſlade,

And the tree ſhadowes three times greater made.

M. Dr.

And now the Sunne was paſt his middleway,

Leaning more louely to his lemmons bed,

And the Moones third howre had attacht the day.

I. Markham.

By this the ſunne had ſpred his golden locks

Vpon the pale greene carpet of the ſea,

And opened wide the ſcarlet doore which locks,

The eaſefull euening from the labouring day,

Now night beganne to leape from yron rocks.

[[Page 333]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=173)And
whippes her ruſtie waggon through the way.

Idem.

The bluſhing ſunne plucks in his ſmiling beames,

[...]aking his ſteedes to mend their woonted pace,

Till plunging downe into the ocean ſtreames,

There in the froathie waues hee hides his face,

Then raines them in more then his vſuall ſpace,

And leaues foule darkneſſe to poſseſſe the skie,

A time moſt fit for fouleſt tragedie.

M.D.

Now the ſunne is mounted vp on hie,

And pawſeth in the midſt of all the skie,

His fierie face vpon the earth doth beate,

And bakes it with intollerable heate.

I. Authoris.

### 1.193. Ʋeſper.

— Now the golden Heſperus

Was mounted bie in toppe of heauens ſheene,

And warned had his brethren ioyous,

To light their bleſſed lamps in Ioues eternall houſe,

Ed. Spencer.

[...] [...]his the night from forth the darkſome bower

G. Peele.

Now the worlds comforter with wearie gate,

His dayes hot taske hath ended in the VVeſt▪

The owle (nights harauld) ſhreekes, tis verie late,

The ſheepe are gone to fold, the birds to neſt,

The cole-blacke cloudes that ſhadow heauens light

Do ſummon vs to parte and bid good night.

W. Sh.

### 1.194. Noctis initium.

Now gan the hunni'd vapour ſhed the ground

With pearlie dew, and th'earths gloomie ſhade

Did dimme the brightneſſe of the welkin round,

That euerie beaſt and bird awarned made,

To ſhrowde themſelues, while ſleep their ſenſes did inuade,

Ed. Spencer.

The ſilent ſhadowes with their mother vaile,

The bright lampe of heauen from Thetis hid,

Apolloes ſiſter in her ſtarry rayle,

Along her lower Sphere in triumpeled.

D. Lodge.

— Cynthia companion of the night,

With ſhining brand lighting his eben carre,

Whoſe axeltree was iet auchact with ſtarres,

And roofe with ſhining rauens feathers cealed,

Piercing my eye lids as I lie along,

Awaked me through.

G. Peele.

[[Page 335]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=175)

Thus whiles dumb ſights their yeelding hearts entā ­gled

The aire with ſparks of liuing fire was ſpāgled,

And night deepe drencht in miſtie Acheron,

Heaued vp her head halfe the world vpon,

Breath'd darknes forth, darke night is Cupids daie.

Ch. Marlow.

— From deepe of regions vnderneath

Nights vaile aroſe and ſunnes bright luſter chacde.

Ed. Fairfax.

Inueſted in her ſtately vale the night

In her kind armes embraced all the round,

The ſiluer moone from Sea vpriſing bright,

Spred froſtie pearle vpon the canded ground.

Idem.

Now blacke-browde night plaſt in her chaire of iet,

Sat wrapt in cloudes within her cabinet,

And with her duskie mantle ouer-ſpread

The path the ſunnie Palfraies vſde to tread,

And Cynthia ſitting in her Criſtall chayre,

In all her pompe did ride along her Sphere,

The honyed dew deſcended in ſoft ſhowres,

Drizled in pearle vpon the tender flowers.

And Zephire huſht, who with a whiſpering gale,

Seemed to harken to the nightingale,

Which in the thornie brakes with her ſweet ſong,

Vnto the ſilent night bewrayde her wrong.

M. Dra.

### 1.195. Noctis concubium.

Now was the heauenly vault depriude of light

With ſunnes depart, and now the darknes of the night,

[[Page 336]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=176) Did light
thoſe beamy ſtars which greater lite did dark

Now each thing that inioyd that fierie quickning ſpark

(Which life is cald) were moud their ſpirits to repoſe,

And wanting vſe of eyes, their eies began to cloſe:

A ſilence ſweete, each where with one conſent imbrast,

A muſicke ſweete, to one in carefull muſing plaſt:

And mother earth now clad in morning weed, did breathe

A dull deſire to kiſſe th'image of our death.

S. Ph. Sydney.

It was the time, when reſt ſoft ſliding downe

From heauens height, into mans heauie eyes,

In the forgetfulneſſe of ſleepe doth drowne

The carefull thoughts of mortall miſeries.

Ed. Spencer.

—The ſunne alreadie ſanke

Beyond our world, and ere I got my boothe,

Each wight with mātle black the night doth ſcooth,

Sauing the glow-worm, which would courteous be,

Of that ſmall light oft watching ſleepers ſee.

The welkin had full niggardly incloſde

In coffer of dimme cloudes his ſiluer groates,

I cleped ſtarres, each thing to reſt diſpoſde,

The caues were full, the mountaines voyde of goates

The birds eyes cloſde, cloſed their chirping notes:

As for the nightingale, woods muſicke King,

It Auguſt was, hee daind not then to ſing.

S. Ph. Sydney.

— Now the ſable ſhade

I cleped night had thicke enueloped

The ſunne, in vaile of double darknes made

Sleepe eaſed care, reſt brought complaint to bed.

Ed. Fairfax.

[[Page 337]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=176)

Now from the freſh, the ſoft, and tender bed,

Of her ſtill mother gentle night out-flew

The fleeting balme on hilles and dales ſhee ſhed,

With honey drops of pure and precious dew,

And on the verdure of greene forreſts ſpred,

The virgin prime roſe, and the violet blew,

And ſweete-breath Zephire on his ſpreading wings

Sleepe, eaſe, repoſe, reſt, peace, and quiet brings,

The thoughts and troubles of broade waking day,

They ſoftly dip in milde obliuions lake.

Idem.

### 1.196. Intempesta nox.

Now when Aldeboran was mounted hie,

Aboue the ſhinie Caſsiopeias chaire,

And all in deadly ſleepe did drowned lie.

Ed. Spencer.

Midnight was come, when euerie vitall thing,

With ſweete ſound ſleepe their wearie limbs did reſt,

The beaſts were ſtill, the little birds that ſing,

Now ſweetely ſlept beſides their mothers breſt,

The old and all were ſnrowded in their reſt,

The waters calme, the cruell ſeas did ceaſe,

The woods, the fields, and all things held their peace

The golden ſtarres were whi [...]ld amidſt theyr race,

And on the earth did laugh with twinckling light,

VVhen each thing neſtled in his reſting place,

Forgat dayes payne with pleaſure of the night,

The hare had no the greedie hounds in ſight,

The fearefull Deare of death ſtood not in doubt,

The Partrich dreamd not of the falchens foot,

[[Page 338]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=177)The vgly
beare now minded not the ſtake,

Nor how the cruell maſtiffes doe her teare,

The ſtagge lay ſtill vnrouſed from the brake,

The foamie bore fear'd not the hunters ſpeare,

All things were ſtill in deſart, buſh and breere:

The quiet heart now from their trauailes reſt,

Soundly they ſlept in moſt of all their reſt.

M. Sackuile.

— The midnights waking ſtarre,

Sad Caſsiopeia with a heauie cheere

Puſht forth her forehead to make knowne from farre,

What time the deadly dole of earth drewe neere.

I. Markham.

With falling miſts the darkeſome night extended

Her ſable wings, and gently ouer-ſpread

Heauens gloomie vaile, whence Phoebus lampe was fled,

Dead time of reſt to euerie mortall wight,

To cheerefull mindes that bringeth wanton ſleepe,

With many a phantaſie and deluding toy,

And penſiue heart it doth delaie and keepe

From tedious companie, that would annoy,

Dull Saturniſts that haue abiurdall ioy.

Th. Storer.

Now ſpread the night her ſpangled canopie,

And ſummond euerie reſtleſſe ſoule to ſleepe,

On beds of tender graſſe the beaſts doe lie,

The fiſhes ſlumbred in the ſilent deepe,

Vnheard was Serpents hiſſe and Dragons crie,

Birds left to ſing and Philomele to weepe:

Onely that noyſe heauens rolling circle keſt,

Sung lullaby to bring the world to reſt.

Ed. Fairfax.

### 1.197. Noctis initium.

When low the night with miſtie mantle ſpread,

Gan darke the day, and dimme the azure skies,

And Ʋenus in her meſſage Hermes ſped

To bloudy Mars, to will him not to riſe,

While ſhee her ſelfe approacht in ſpeedie wiſe,

And Ʋirgo hiding her diſdainfull breaſt,

VVith Thetis now had layd her downe to reſt,

While Scorpio dreading Sagitarius dart,

Whoſe bow preſt bent, in fight the ſtring had ſlipt▪

Downe ſlid into the Ocean floud a part,

The beare that in the iriſh ſeas had dipt

Hs griſly feete, with ſpeede from thence he whipt,

For Thetis haſting from the virgins bed,

Purſude the beare that ere ſhe came was fled,

And Phaethon now neere reaching to his race,

With gliſtering beames gold ſtreaming where they bent▪

VVas preſt to enter in his reſting place,

Enryhius that in the carte firſt went,

Had euen now attain'd his iourneyes ſtent,

And faſt declining hid away his head,

Where Titan coucht him in his purple bed,

And now pale Cynthia with her borrowed light,

Beginning to ſupplie her brothers place,

Was paſt the noone-ſted ſixe degrees in ſight,

When ſparkling ſtarres amidſt the heauens face,

With twinckling light ſhone on the earth apace,

That while they brought about the nights chaire,

The dark had dimd the day ere I was ware.

M. Sac.

Such time as from her mothers tender lap

The night aroſe, garded with gentle winds,

[[Page 340]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=178)And with h
[...]r precious dew refreſht the ſappe,

Of bloome and darke, (whilſt that her mantle blinds

The vaile of heauen) and euery birde was ſtill,

Saue Philomele that did bemone her ill:

When in the Weſt Orion lift aloft

His ſtately creſt, and ſmilde vpon the twins,

And Cynthia ſeemely bright (whoſe eye full oft

Had watcht her loue) with radiant light begins,

To pierce the vaile of ſilence with her beames,

Sporting with wanton cleere in Ocean ſtreames.

VVhen little winds in beating of their wings,

Did woe the eyes to leaue their conſtant walke,

And all was huſht ſaue Zephirus that ſings,

With louely breathings for the ſea nymphs ſake,

My wrathfull greefes perplexe my mind ſo ſore,

That forth I walkt, my ſorrowes to deplore.

D. Lodge.

### 1.198. Poeticall Deſcriptions.  
Of Theologie.

In chariot framed of celeſtiall mould,

And ſimple pureneſſe of the pureſt skie,

A more then heauenly nymph I did behold,

Who glauncing on mee with her gracious eye,

So gaue mee leaue her beautie to eſpie,

For ſure no ſence ſuch ſight can comprehend,

Except her beames theyr fayre reflection lend

[[Page 341]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=178)Her
beautie with eternitie beganne,

And onely vnto God was euer ſeene,

When Eden was poſſeſt with ſinfull man,

She came to him, and gladly would haue beene,

The long ſucceedings worlds eternall Queene,

But they refuſed her (O hainous deede)

And from that garden baniſht was that ſeede,

Since when at ſundrie times and ſundry wayes,

Atheiſme, and blinded ignorance conſpire,

How to obſcure thoſe holy burning rayes,

And quench that zeale of heart-inflaming fire,

As makes our ſoules to heauenly things aſpire:

But all in vaine, for maugre all their might,

She neuer loſt one ſparkle of her light.

Pearles may bee foyld, and gold bee turn'd to droſſe,

The ſunne obſcur'd, the moone bee turn'd to bloud,

The world may ſorrow for Aſtreas loſſe,

The heauens darkened like a duskie wood,

Waſt deſerts lie where watrie fountaines ſtood;

But fayre Theologie (for ſo ſhee hight)

Shall neuer looſe one ſparkle of her light.

Such one ſhe was, as in his Hebrew ſong,

The wiſeſt king for faireſt creature prooues,

Embracing her the Cedar trees among,

Comparing her to roſes and to Doues,

Preferring her before all other loues,

Such one ſhe was, and euerie whit as fayre,

Beſides theſe two was neuer ſuch a payre.

T. Storer.

[[Page 342]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=179)

### 1.199. Astrologie.

Her hand-maides in Amazon-like attire,

Went chaſte and modeſt like Dianaes traine,

One by her gazing lookes ſeemes to aſpire

Beyond the Moone, and in a high diſdaine,

To deeme the world and worldly treaſures vaine.

She hight Aſtrologie, on whoſe bright lawne,

Spheres Aſtrolabes and skilfull globes are drawn.

### 1.200. Retoricke.

The next, fayre ſmiling with a pleaſing cheeke,

Had power to rauiſh and inchaunt mens eares,

Hight Rhetorick, whoſe ſhadowed vaile ſhowen cleere

With ſiluer tongues, and ouer it ſhe weares,

A wimpled ſcarfe, bedewd with hearers teares,

Whoſe captiue hearts ſhe ſhould detaine long while,

With pleaſance of her vnaffected ſtile.

### 1.201. Of Logicke.

The third a quicke-eyde dame of piercing ſight,

That reaſons worth in equall ballance wayed,

The truth ſhee lou'd aboue all earthly wight,

Yet could not tell her loue, but what ſhee ſayd

Was certaine true, and ſhee a perfect maide,

Her garments ſhort, tuckt vp to earth preparde,

And ſhee calld Logicke without welt or gard.

Th. Storer.

[[Page 343]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=179)

### 1.202. Arith. Muſicke. Geometrie.

Next theſe, whoſe outward lookes I knew aright,

And had ſome portion of their endleſſe treaſure,

Fayre Algebra with fingers richly dight,

Sweete Muſicke founder of delightſome pleaſure,

Earth-ſcanning nymph, directreſſe of all meaſure.

Theſe humbly did her ſoueraigne highnes greet,

And meekely layd their garlands at her feete.

From euerie one ſhee pluckt a ſpeciall flower,

And layd each flower vpon a ſeuerall part,

Then from her one a ſtemme of wondrous power,

Whoſe leaues were beames, whoſe ſtalke a fiery dart.

And that ſhe layd vpon my trembling heart,

Theſe were the buds of art, this plant of bliſſe,

This gaue them life, they yeelded grace to this.

Th. Storer.

### 1.203. Of Battaile.

Two greater kings were neuer ſeene before.

Then camped was in Ragan field at morne,

With haughtie hearts enarmed all on ire,

Each ſouldiour ſet another ſo on fire,

Thar ſcarcely they could keepe them in their bounde

Till pipe or Cymball, or the Trumpet ſound,

Denounce the chocke, but with their furious faces,

They threate their foes with fell menaces,

And ſtroks at hand, two thouſand lads forlorne

(To blunt the ſword) were downe in battaile borne,

Vpon their flames flew feruently their ſtones,

[[Page 344]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=180)That bet
theyr bucklers to their bruſed bones,

The Squadron then ſteps ſternely to the ſtroke,

With hearts inhumane all the battaile yoakes,

And are ſupplyde with many mightie bands,

Some counters them, and ſternely them withſtands,

With foote to foote each other ouerpries,

Both Medes and Caldes claſpe with gaſtly cryes,

Like Nylus ſtreames that from the rocke do rumble,

[...] Encelade when he in tombe doth tumble.

Tho. Hudſ [...].

### 1.204. Of a kiſſe.

Beſt charge, and braueſt retrait in Cupids fight,

A double key which opens to the heart,

Moſt rich, when moſt his riches it impart,

Neaſt of yong ioyes, ſchoole-maſter of de [...]ight,

Teaching the meane at once to take and giue,

The friendly ſtay, where blows both wound & heale

The pettie death where each in other liue,

Poore hopes firſt wealth, hoſtage of promiſe weake.

Breakefaſt of loue.

S. Ph. Sydney.

### 1.205. Of People.

People, leſſe ſetled then the ſl [...]ding ſand,

[...]ore mutable then Proteus or the Moone,

T [...]nd and  [...]e [...]urnd in turning of a hand,

[...]e Eu [...]pus [...]b [...]e flowing euery noone:

Thou thouſand headed headleſſe monſter moſt,

Of ſl [...]ine like Antheus, and as oft new riſing,

Who hard as ſteele, as light as wingd art toſt,

[[Page 345]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=180)Camelion
like, each ob [...]ects colour priſing.

I. Sylueſter.

### 1.206. Diſdaine.

A ſturdie villaine ſtirring ſtrife and bold,

As though the higheſt God defie he would:

In his right hand an iron clubbe hee held,

But hee himſelfe was all of golden mould,

Yet had both life and ſence, and well could weilde

That curſed weapon, when his cruell foes he queld,

D [...]ſdaine he called was, and did diſdaine

So to be calde, and who ſo him did call.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.207. Of the ſame.

— Loe a knight vnto his ſocour went

All arm'd in ſhining ſteele, and on his ſhield,

He bare a yoake in ſundrie peeces rent.

And flames of fire all in a yellow field:

So weaponed he was, as if hee ment

To make all that incountred him to yeeld:

A ſword and ſpeare hee had, and to the ſame

A mace, from whence he threw continuall flame,

His mace was ſtorde with euerlaſting fire,

That euer burned and did neuer waſte,

No other wagon needed one deſire

To make good way which way ſoere he paſt,

And ſure Rinaldoes danger did require,

Quicke remedie, wherefore the knight did haſte,

And when hee ſaw this monſter and did vew her,

[[Page 346]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=181)VVith his
ſtiffe ſpeare forth with hee ouerthrew her:

But this ſame fall did her no whit annoy,

Wherefore to vſe his ſpeare he now miſliketh,

Onely hee will his fierie face imploy,

And with thar ſame the monſter foule hee ſtriketh,

Then ſhee no longer could her force inioy.

S. I. H.

### 1.208. Of Dearth.

—Dearth the liuely forme of death,

Still yawning wide with lothſome ſtinking breath,

VVith hollow eyes, with meger cheekes and chinne,

VVith ſharpe leane bones, piercing her ſable skinne,

Her emptie bowels may bee plainely ſpide,

Cleane through the wrinckles of her withered hide,

Shee hath no bellie, but the bellies ſeate,

Her knees and knuckles ſwelling very great,

Inſatiate Orque, that euen at one repaſte,

Almoſt all creatures in the world with waſte,

VVhoſe greedie gorge diſh after diſh doth draw,

Seekes meate in meate, for ſtill her monſtrous maw

Voydes in deuouring, and ſometimes ſhe eates

Her owne deere babes, for lacke of other meates,

Nay more ſometimes (O ſtrangeſt gluttonie,)

Shee eates her ſelfe, her ſelfe to ſatisfie,

Leſsning her ſelfe, her ſelfe ſo to inlarge,

And cruell thus, ſhee doth our grandfire charge,

And brings beſide from Limbo to aſsiſt her,

Rage, feebleneſſe, and thirſt her ruthleſſe ſiſter.

I. Silueſter.

[[Page 347]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=181)

### 1.209. Of Thirſt.

—Cruell thirſt came out of Cyren land,

Where ſhee was foſtered on the burning ſand,

With hote intracted tongue, and ſunken eine,

VVith ſtomacke worne, and wrinckled viſage keene

VVith light and meagre, corſe, and pailed vaines,

In ſteede of bloud, that brimſtone hot retaines,

Her poyſoned mouth blew through that holy towne,

Such helliſh aire, that ſtiffeled vp and down.

Th. Had.

### 1.210. Old Woman.

Her eyes were ſunk into her head,

Her cheeks were leane and lanke,

Out ſtood her chin,

Into her mouth her bloudleſſe lips they ſanke,

Her toothleſſe chappes

Diſgraſte her tongue in telling of a tale,

And ſucke ſhe might

A teat for teeth and ſpoonage too did faile,

Her haire ſince ſixtie yeeres

Not blacke, was now, nor white, or none,

The ſubstance of her wrinckled face

Were onely skinne and bone,

Dimme were her eyes,

Deafe were her eares, ranke ſmelt, if ſhe could ſent,

A palſie made her feeling ceaſe,

Downe tastleſſe foode it went.

W. Warner.

### 1.211. Of a Combate.

Sometime they proffer, then they pauſe a while,

Sometime ſtrike out, like maſters of the play,

Now ſtand vpright, now ſtoope, another while,

Now open lie, now couer all they may.

[[Page 348]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=182)Now ward
then with a ſlippe the blow beguilde,

Now forward ſtep, now backe a little way,

Now round about, and where the tone giues place,

There ſtill the other preſſeth in his place.

S. I. H.

### 1.212. Of Albion.

— Faire Albion glorie of the North,

Neptunes beſt darling held betweene his armes,

Diuided from the world, as better worth,

Kept from himſelfe, defended from all harmes.

S. Daniell.

This royall throne of Kings, this ſceptred yle.

This earth of maieſtie, this ſeate of Mars,

This other Eden, this demi-paradiſe,

This fortreſſe built by nature for her ſelfe,

Againſt inteſtion and the hand of warre,

This happie breede of man, this little world,

This precious ſtone ſette in the ſiluer ſea,

Which ſerues it in the office of a wall,

Or as a Moate defenſiue to a houſe,

Againſt the enuie of leſſe happier lands,

This nurſe, this teeming wombe of royall Kings,

Fearde by their breede, and famous by their byrth,

Renowned in their deedes as farre from home,

For charitie, ſeruice, and true chiualrie,

As is the Sepulchre in ſtubburne Iewrie.

M. Dr.

[[Page 349]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=182)

### 1.213. Of Aegipt.

The faireſt flower that glories Affrica,

Whoſe beautie Phebus dare not daſh with ſhowres,

O [...]er whoſe climate neuer hung a cloude,

But ſmiling Titan lights the Horizon.

R. Greene.

### 1.214. Hieruſalem.

Hieruſalem is feared on two hilles,

Of height vnlike, and turned ſide to ſide,

The ſpace betweene a gentle vallie filles,

From mount to mount exſpanſed faire and wide,

Three ſides are ſure imbarde with crags and hilles,

The reſt is eaſie  [...]cant to riſe eſpide,

But mightie bulwarks fence that plainer part,

So art helps nature, nature ſtrengthneth art.

The towne is ſtorde of troughs and ceſtornes made,

To keepe freſh water, but the countrey ſeemes

Deuoyde of graſſe, vnfit for plowmens trade,

Not fertill, moyſt, with riuers, welles, and ſtreames,

There grow few trees, to make the ſummers ſhade,

To ſhield the parched land from ſcorehing beames,

Saue that a wood ſtands ſixe miles from the towne,

With aged Cedars, darke and ſhadowes browne:

By eaſt among the duskie vallies glide,

The ſiluer ſtreames of Iordanes ſiler floud,

By weſt the mid-land ſea with bounders tyde,

O [...] ſandie ſhowres, where loppa whilom ſtood,

By North Samaria ſtands, and on that ſide,

The golden Calfe was reard in Bethell wood,

[[Page 350]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=183)Bethlem by
South, where Chriſt incarnate was,

A pearle in ſteele, a diamond ſette in braſſe.

Ed. Fairfax.

### 1.215. Of Deluge.

Heauens Criſtall windowes with one hand God opes

Where on the world a thouſand ſeas hee droppes,

With th'other hand hee gripes and wringeth forth,

The ſpungie globe of the execrable earth,

So ſtraightly preſt that it doth ſtrait reſtore,

All liquid flouds that it had drunke before,

In euerie rocke new riuers doe beginne,

And to his aide the ſnowes came tumbling in.

The Pines and Cedars haue but bowes to ſhew,

The ſhoares do ſhrinke, the ſwelling waters grow.

I. Sylueſter.

### 1.216. Of a Courtier effeminate.

About his necke a carknet rich hee ware

Of precious ſtones all ſette in gold well tried,

His armes that carſt all warlike weapons bare,

In golden bracelets wantonly were tied,

Into his eares two rings conuayed are,

Of golden wire, at which on eirher ſide,

Two Indian pearles, in making, like two peares

Of paſsing price, were pendant at his eares,

His locks bedewd with waters of ſweete ſauour,

Stood curled round in order on his head,

He had ſuch wanton womaniſh behauiour,

As though in Ʋalence he had long beene bred,

So changd in ſpeech, in manners, and in fauour,

[[Page 351]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=183)So from
himſelfe beyond all reaſon ledde,

By theſe inchauntments of this amorous dame,

He was himſelfe in nothing but in name.

S. I. H.

### 1.217. Of Eden.

For Adam God choſe out an happie ſeate,

A climate temperate both for cold and heate,

Which daintie Flora paueth ſumptuouſly,

With flowrie Ʋers inameld tapiſtrie,

Pomona prancks with fruits, whoſe taſte excelles,

And Zephir filles with muske and amber ſmelles,

VVhere God himſelfe (as gardiner) treades the allies,

VVith trees and corne couers the hilles and vallies,

Summons ſweet ſleep with noyſe of hundred brooks,

And ſunne-proofe arbors makes in ſundrie nookes,

Hee plants, hee proines, he pares, he trimmeth round,

The euer-greene bewties of a fruitfull ground:

Heere, there, the courſe of th'holy lakes he leades,

VVith thouſand dies he motleth all the meade.

I. Sylueſter.

### 1.218. Of Ʋ Ʋinds.

—O heauens freſh flames quoth hee,

Earths ſweeping broomes, O forreſts enmitie,

O you my haraulds, and my harbengers,

My nimble poſts, and ſpeedie meſſengers,

My armes, my ſinewes, and my Eagles ſwift,

That through the ayre my rowling chariot lift.

I. Syluester.

[[Page 352]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=184)

### 1.219. Of a drunken man.

His head growes giddie, and his foote indents,

A mightie fume his troub [...]ed braine torments,

His idle prattle from their purpoſe quite,

Is abrupt, fluttering, all confuſde, and light,

His wine ſtuft ſtomacke wrung with wind he feeles,

His trembling tent all topſi-turuie wheeles,

At laſt not able on his legges to ſtand,

More like a foule ſwine then a ſober man,

Oppreſt with ſleepe hee wallowes on the ground,

His ſhameleſſe ſnorting trounke ſo deepely drownd,

In ſelfe-obliuion, that he did not hide,

Thoſe parts that Caeſar couered when hee died.

Idem.

### 1.220. A Palmer.

A ſillie man in ſimple weede forworne,

And ſoyld with duſt of the long dryed way,

His ſandales were with toylſome trauell torne,

And face all tand with ſcorching ſunnie ray,

As hee had trauaild many a ſummers day,

Through boyling ſands of Affrica and Inde,

And in his hand a Iacobs ſtaffe to ſtay

His wearie limbs vpon, and eke behind,

His ſcrip did hang, in which his needmets he did bind

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.221. Of Harpies.

Seuen of them came together in a knot,

VVith womens faces, wanne, with deadly cold,

[[Page 353]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=184)So hunger-
ſtaru'd, as death it ſelfe might not

Be at firſt ſight more hidious to behold:

Their wings were great, but foule black wings god wot,

Theyr tallents ſharp to gripe, and ſtrong to hold,

A large foule panch, a filthy tayle and long,

From whence there came a mighty odour ſtrong.

S. I. Harr.

### 1.222. Of Cyprus.

— With filled ſayles, in little while,

They came as farre as Cyprus, Ʋenus Ile:

Heere euery place was full of odours ſweet,

Of gardens fayre, of ſpyce of pleaſant taſt,

The people luſtfull, (for dame Venus meete)

From tender yeeres to doating age doe laſt,

With wanton damſels walking in each ſtreet,

Inuiting men to pleaſure and repaſt.

S. I. Harr.

### 1.223. Of the Rainebow.

Noah lookes vp, and in the ayre he viewes

A ſemicircle of an hundred hewes;

vvhich bright aſcending toward th'aetheriall thrones,

Hath a line drawne betweene two Horizons

For iuſt Diameter: an euen bent bow

Contriu'd of three: whereof the one doth ſhow

To be all painted of a golden hew;

The ſecond greene, the third an orient blew:

Yet ſo, that in this pure blew-golden greene,

Still (ô pall-like) ſome changeable is ſeene;

A bow bright ſhining in th'archers hand,

[[Page 354]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=185)Whoſe
ſubtile ſtring ſeemes leuell with the land,

Halfe parting heauen, and ouer vs it bends,

vvithin two ſeas wetting his horned ends;

A temporall beautie of the lampfull skyes,

vvhere powerfull Nature ſhewes her freſh-red dies.

And if you onely blew and red perceaue,

The ſame as ſignes of ſea and fire conceaue,

Of both the flowing and the flaming doome,

The iudgement past, and iudgement yet to come.

I. Siluester.

### 1.224. Of Paradice,

Soone after he a chriſtall ſtreame eſpying,

From foote to head he waſht himſelfe therein,

Then vp he gets him on his courſer flying,

And of the ayre he more and more doth win:

Aſcending heauen, all earthly thoughts defying.

As fiſhes cut the liquid ſtreame with fin,

So cutteth he the ayre and doth not ſtop

Till he was come vnto the mountaine top.

This hill nie toucht the circle of the Moone,

The top was all a fruitefull pleaſant fielde,

And light at night, as ours is heere at noone,

The ſweeteſt place that euer man beheld,

(There would I dwell if God gaue me my boone)

The ſoyle thereof moſt fragrant flowers doth yeeld,

Like Rubies, gold, Saphire, pearles, Topaze ſtones,

Chriſolites, Diamonds, Iacinths for the nonce.

The trees that there did grow, were euer greene,

The fruite that thereon grew were neuer fading,

The ſundry coloured birds did ſit betweene

[[Page 355]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=185)(Singing
moſt ſweet) the fruitfull boughes thē ſhading,

Riuers more cleere then Chriſtall to be ſeene,

The fragrant ſmell, the ſence and ſoule inuading;

With ayre ſo temperate and ſo delightſome,

As all the place beſide was cleere and lightſome.

### 1.225. Of Diana,

The firſt with cloths tuckt vp as Nimphs in woods doe range,

Tuckt vp euē to the knees, with bowes & arrowes preſt

Her right arme naked was, diſcouered was her breſt:

But heauy was her pace, & ſuch a megre cheere,

As little hunting mind (God knows) did there appeere.

S. Phil. Sidney.

— Now great Phoebe in her tryumph came,

With all the titles of her glorious name,

Diana, Delia, Luna, Cynthia,

Virago, Hecate, and Elythia,

Prothyria, Dictinna, Proſerpine,

Latona, and Lucina moſt diuine.

M. Drayton.

### 1.226. Cynthia.

The ſiluer Moone, dread ſoueraigne of the deepe

That with the floods fills vp her horned head,

And by her waine, the waining ebs doth keepe.

Iar. Markham.

—VVith a braſe of ſiluer hindes,

[...] Iuorie Chariot ſwifter then the windes,

[...] great Hyperions horned daughter drawne,

[...]nchauntreſſe like, deckt in diſparent Lawne.

[[Page 356]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=186)Circled
with charmes and incantations,

That ride huge ſpirits and ouragious paſsions;

Muſicke and moode ſhe loues, but loue ſhe hates,

As curious Ladies doe their publique cates.

G. Chapman.

Natures bright eye-ſight, and the nights faire ſoule,

That with thy triple forhead dooſt controule

Earth, ſeas, and hell, and art in dignitie

The great'ſt and ſwifteſt Planet in the skie.

Idem.

### 1.227. Venus.

—Mounting in the Eaſt

Faire Ʋenus in her Iuorie coach did haſt,

And towards thoſe penſiue Dames her courſe addreſt

Her Doues ſo plied theyr wauing wings with flight,

That ſtraight the ſacred Goddeſſe came in ſight.

Vpon her head ſhe bare that gorgious crowne

vvherein the poore Amintas is a ſtarre,

Her louely locks her boſome hanging downe,

Thoſe nets that firſt inſnard the God of warre:

Delicious-louely ſhine her louely eyes,

And on her cheekes Carnation clowdes ariſe.

D. Lodge.

### 1.229. Of Cupid.

Amongſt this gameſome crue is ſeene,

The iſſue of the Cyprian Queene,

Whoſe head and ſhoulders fethered beene;

And as the ſtarres his countenaunce ſheene.

In his left hand his bow he bare,

And by his ſide his quiuer ware,

In power he ſits paſt all compare,

And with his flames the world doth dare;

A ſcepter in his hand he held,

With Chloris natiue flowers vntild,

And Nectars deathleſſe odours ſtild

From his bright locks the Sun digild.

The triple Graces there aſsiſt,

Suſtaining with theyr breſts commiſt

And knees that Thetis boſome kiſt

The challice of this Amoriſt.

G. Chapman tranſl.

— Him the greateſt of the Gods we deeme,

Borne without ſinne or couples of one kind,

For Ʋ  [...]nus ſelfe doth ſolie couples ſeeme,

Both male and female through commixture ioynd,

So pure and ſpotleſſe Cupid forth ſhe brought,

And in the gardens of Adonis nurſt:

Where growing, he his owne perfection wrought,

And ſhortly was of all the Gods the firſt.

Then got he bow and ſhafts of gold and lead,

In which ſo fell and puiſſant he grew,

That Ioue himſelfe his power began to dread,

And taking vp to heauen, him godded new.

[[Page 358]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=187)From
thence he ſhoots his arrowes euery where

Into the vvorld at random as he will,

On vs frayle men.

S. Daniell.

### 1.230. Venus.

— Now in ire,

Shee mounts her chariot ſwifter then the winde

Or ſubtill comprehenſion of the minde,

vvhich by two nimble Cock-ſparrowes was drawne

Capariſond but lightly with the lawne

Tooke from the Flowre-deluces inner skin,

Trapt and imboſt with Marigolds: within

Sits Ʋenus naked, holding in her hand

A tumbling ſhelfiſh with a Mirtle wand;

Wearing a garland on her wimpled head,

Compacted of the white Roſe, and the red.

None but the blinde boy Cupid durſt approch

For to be whurried with her in her Coach,

The ſnow-white Graces running by theyr ſides,

Were through the heauens theyr wagoners & guides,

Laſhing the Sparrowes vnder quiuering wings,

With whyps of twiſted gold, and ſiluer ſtrings,

A beauie of white Doues ſtill fluttring ouer,

From the ſunnes ſight ſuch beautie ſeem'd to couer;

And thus ſhee rode in tryumph in her throne,

Whoſe radiant luſtre like the ſunne-beames ſhone.

I. Weeuer.

[[Page 359]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=187)

### 1.231. Calme weather.

As then no winde at all there blew,

No ſwelling clowde accloyd the ayre,

The skye like graſſe of watched hue

Reflected Phaebus golden haire:

The garniſht trees no pendant ſtird,

Nor voyce was heard of any bird.

Mat. Roydon.

The King of windes calls home his poſts againe,

And Amphitrite ſmooth's her watry plaine,

The ayre his clowdes hath chang'd to chriſtall cleere,

And now the lamps of light from heauen appeare.

J. Syluester.

### 1.232. Of Tempests.

On Neptune war was made by Aeolus and his traine,

who letting looſe the vvinds, toſt & tormented the ayre,

So that on euery coaſt, men ſhipwracke did abide,

Or els were ſwallowed vp in open ſea with waues,

And ſuch as came to ſhore, were beaten with diſpayre.

Edm. Spen.

— VVithin a little ſeaſon,

The vvinde diſcouered his deceite and treaſon,

Firſt from the poope, it changed to the ſide,

Then to the prore, at laſt it whirled round,

Long in a place it neuer would abide,

vvhich doth the Pilots wit and skill confound;

The ſurging waues ſwell ſtill in higher pride,

Proteus white flocke, did more and more abound,

And ſeem'd to them as many deaths to threaten,

[[Page 360]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=188)As the
ſhyps ſides with diuers waues are beaten,

Now in theyr face the winde, ſtraight on theyr back,

And forward this, and backward that it blowes,

Then on the ſide it makes the ſhyp to crack,

Among the Marriners confuſion growes,

The Maiſter doubts ruine and preſent wrack,

For none his will, nor none his meaning knowes.

To whiſtle, becken, cry, it nought auailes,

Sometime to ſtrike, ſometime to turne theyr ſailes,

But none there was could heare, nor ſee, nor marke:

Theyr eares ſo ſtopt, ſo dazeled were theyr eyes,

vvith vveather ſo tempeſtuous, and ſo darke,

And black thick clowdes, that with the ſtorme did riſe,

From whence ſometimes great ghaſtly flames did ſpark [...]

And thunder claps that ſeem'd to rent the skies;

Which made them in a manner deafe and blind,

That no man vnderſtoode the Maiſters minde:

Nor leſſe, nor much leſſe fearefull is the ſound

The cruell tempeſt in the tackle makes,

Yet each one for himſelfe ſome buſines found,

And ſo ſome ſpeciall office him betakes:

One this vntide, another this faſt bound,

He the maine bowling now reſtraines, now ſlakes,

Some take an oare, ſome at the pumpe take paine,

And powre the ſea, into the Sea againe.

Behold a horrible and hideous blaſt,

That Boreas from his frozen lips doth ſend,

Doth backward force the ſaile againſt the maſt,

And makes the waues vnto the skies aſcend,

Then brake theyr oares and rudder eke at laſt,

Nothing was left from tempeſt to defend.

[[Page 361]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=188)So that
the ſhip as ſwai'd now quite a-ſide,

Vnto the vvaues laid ope her naked ſide,

Then all a-ſide the ſtaggering ſhip did reele,

For one ſide quite beneath the water lay,

And on the tother ſide the very keele,

Aboue the water plaine diſcerne you may;

Then thought they all hope paſt, & down they kneele,

And vnto God to take their ſoules they pray;

Worſe danger grew then this, when this was paſt,

By meanes the ſhip gan after leake ſo faſt,

The winde, the waues to them no reſpite gaue,

But ready euery houre to ouer-throw them;

Oft they were hoiſt ſo high vpon the waue,

They thought the middle region was below them:

Oft-times ſo low the ſand their veſſell draue,

As though that Charon there his boat wold ſhow them.

Scant had they time, or power to fetch their breath,

All things did threaten them ſo preſent death.

S. I. Harr.

— An hoaſt of blacke and ſable clouds

Gan to ecclipſe Lucinaes ſiluer face,

And with a hurling noyſe from forth the South,

A guſt of winde did raiſe the billowes vp,

Then ſcantled we our ſailes with ſpeedy hands,

And tooke our drablers from our bonners ſtraine,

And ſeuered our bonnets from our courſes:

Our top ſailes vp we truſſe, our ſprite ſailes in,

But vainely ſtriue they that reſiſt the heauens,

For loe the waues incenſe then more and more,

Mounting with hideous rorings from the depth;

Our Barke is battered by encountring ſtormes,

[[Page 362]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=189)And welnie
ſteemd by breaking of the clouds:

The ſteeres-man pale, and carefull holds the helme,

Wherein the truſt of life and ſafety lay,

Till all at once, a mortall tale to tell,

Our ſailes were ſplit by Biſas bitter blaſt;

Our middle broke, and we bereft of hope;

There might you ſee with pale and ghaſtly lookes,

The dead in thought, and dolefull Marchant lifts

Their eyes and hands vnto their Country Gods,

The goods we caſt in bowels of the Sea,

A ſacrifice to ſwage proud Neptunes ire.

D. Lodge.

Now Nerrus foames, and now the wrathfull waue,

Toſt and turmoild by angry Neptunes ſlaues,

Doe mount and rowle, gainſt Thetis heauen doth fight,

And ſhe (inrag'd) vſurpt on Rheas right,

An ayre, black, ſable, ſad, ore-ſpread the skies,

And reaues all light from wofull Saylers eyes:

Or if ſome beames breake through their pitchy night,

This naught, but lighning flaſhes full of fright.

I. Syluester.

The Eaſterne winds driues on the roring traine

Of white blew billowes, and the clouds againe

With freſh ſeas croſſe the ſeas, and ſhe doth ſend

In counter-change a raine with ſalty blend

The heauens, doe ſeeme in Thetis lap to fall,

The Sea-ſtarre, skies, and God to arme this all:

Againſt one ſhip that skips from ſtarres to ground,

From waue to waue (like windy ballances bound)

The whilſt the Pylot on a foamy mount,

Thinks from the pole to ſee hells pit profound;

[[Page 363]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=189)And then
caſt downe vnto the ſandy ſhore,

Seemes from low hell to ſee the lofty pole,

And feeling foes within and eke without,

As many waues ſo many deaths doth doubt:

The Sea ſharp-ſurging round about the ſhip,

Vncaulks their keele, and doth her ſeames vmip,

Whereby the waters entring vncontrold,

Ebbing abroad, yet flow a-pace in hold,

For euery  [...]un the plied pump doth free,

A flood breakes in, the amazed maiſter hee,

His cunning conquered by the perils plaines,

Doubts what to ſay, or where to turne his raines,

Which waue to meete, or which ſalt ſurge to flie,

So yeelds his charge in ſea to liue or die.

Strike ſaile the Maiſter cries, ſtrike ſaile amaine,

Vaile miſme, and ſprite ſaile, but the winds conſtraine

With boiſtrous blaſts that beate vpon his face,

His ſea-ſhapt ſpeech to fly before their chace:

Of men diſmay'd, the ſad confuſed cries,

Wroath Neptunes noyſe, and bellowing winds likewiſe;

Heauens thunder-claps, the tacklings whiſtling,

(Strange Minſtrells) doe dire dreadfull deſcant ſing.

Ioſuah Syluester.

The day with cloud was ſuddaine ouer-caſt,

And angry Joue an hideous ſtorme of raine,

Did poure into his Lemmons lap ſo faſt,

That euery wight to ſhroud it did conſtraine.

Ed. Spencer.

The ayre doth on the ſuddaine grow obſcure,

Lightened ſometimes with lightnings dreadfull light,

[[Page 364]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=190)And ſaue
their houre-glaſſe, kept the reckning ſure,

Twas hard for to diſcerne the day from night;

The deſperate Marriners doe all indure

As men inured to the waters ſpight;

The heauens aboue, the waues beneath vs roare,

Yet are they not diſmai'd one whit therefore;

One with a whiſtle, hang'd about his necke,

Shewes by the ſound which cord muſt be vndone,

And ſtraite the ſhip-boy ready at a becke,

Vnto the tops with nimble ſleight doth runne:

The other Marriners vpon the decke;

Or at the ſteere the comming vvaues doe ſhunne,

And then by turnes they pump the water out,

By paine and care preuenting euery doubt.

S. I. Harrington,

The heauens on euery ſide incloſed be,

Black ſtormes and foggs are blowen vp from farre,

That now the Pilot can no Load-ſtarre ſee,

But skies and Seas doe make moſt dreadfull warre:

The billowes ſtriuing to the heauens to reach,

And th'heauens ſtriuing them for to impeach.

R. Greene.

### 1.233. Of the Spring

The ſoote ſeaſons that blood, & bloome foorth brings,

With greene hath clad the hill and eke the vale;

The Nightingale with feathers new ſhe ſings,

The Turtle to her mate hath told her tale:

Sommer is come, for euery ſpray now ſprings;

The Hart hath hung his old head on the pale:

The Bucke in brake his Winter-coate he flings:

[[Page 365]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=190)The Fiſhes
fleete with new-repared ſcale:

The Adder all her ſloth away ſhe flings:

The ſwift Swallow purſueth the flies ſmall:

The buſie Bee her honey now ſhe mings:

Winter is worne that was the flowers bale.

E. of Surrey.

The Winters wrath begins to quell,

And pleaſant Spring appeareth;

The graſſe now gins to be refreſht,

The Swallow peepes out of her neſt,

And cloudy welkin cleareth.

E. Spenſer.

Flora now calleth for each flower,

And bid's make ready Maias bower,

That new is vp riſe from bed.

Idem.

The earth late choakt with ſhowres,

Is now arai'd in greene,

Her boſome ſprings with flowers,

The ayre diſſolues her teene;

The vvoods are deckt with leaues,

And trees are cloathed gay,

And Flora crown'd with ſheaues,

With oaken boughs doth play,

The birds vpon the trees

Doe ſing with pleaſant voyces,

And chaunt in their degrees,

Their loues and luckie choyces.

D. Lodge.

The tenth of March when Aries receau'd,

Dan-Phoebus rayes into his horned head.

[[Page 366]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=191)In flowry
ſeaſon of the yeare,

And when the firmament was cleare,

When Tellus her balls painted were,

With iſſue of diſparent cheere;

When the Vſher to the morne did riſe,

Sleepe gaue their vituall liberties

To Phillis and to Floraes eyes.

G. Chapman.

The ayre was calme, the day was cleare,

Loues wanton winds with wooing breathe,

Gan greete the ſweeteſt of the yeare,

The flower forgot his Winters death;

The earth reuiued by the ſunne,

To let in gay attire begunne.

The leafe allied vnto the tree,

By helpe of ſpring in coate of greene,

Stole forth my wandring eye to ſee,

The beauties of the Sommers Queene.

D. Lodge.

The Winter with his griſly ſtormes no longer dare abide,

The pleaſant graſſe with luſty greene the earth hath newly died,

The trees hath leaues, the boughs do ſpred, new changed is the yeare

The water brooks are clean ſunk down, the pleſant boughs appeare,

The Spring is come, the goodly Nimphs now dance in euery place:

Thus hath the yeare moſt pleaſantly of lately chang'd her face.

E. of Surrey.

Now each creature ioyes the other,

Paſſing happy dayes and howers,

One bird reports vnto an other,

In the fall of ſiluer ſhowers:

[[Page 367]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=191)vvhilſt
the earth our common mother,

Hath her boſome deckt with flowers.

Whilſt the neareſt torch of heauen,

vvith bright rayes warmes Eloraes lap,

Making nights and dayes both euen.

Chearing plants with freſhnes ſap.

S. Daniell.

### 1.234. Of VVinter.

The wrathfull Winter proching on a pace,

vvith bluſtring blaſts had all ybard the treene,

And old Saturnus with his froſty face,

vvith chilling cold had pearſt the tender greene;

The mantles rent wherein inwrapped beene;

The gladſome Groues that now lay ouer-throwne,

The Tapers torne, and euery tree downe blowne;

The ſoyle that erſt ſo ſeemely was to ſeeme,

vvas all diſpoiled of her beauties hewe,

And ſtole freſh flowers (wher-with the ſomers Queene

Had clad the earth) now Boreas blaſt downe blew,

And ſmall fowles flocking in their ſongs did rew

The vvinters wrath, where-with each thing defaſt,

In wofull wiſe bewayl'd the Sommer paſt:

Hawthorne had loſt his motly liuerie:

The naked twigs were ſhiuering all for cold,

And dropping downe the teares aboundantlie;

Each thing (me thought) with weeping eye me told,

The cruell ſeaſon, bidding me with-hold

My ſelfe within, for I was gotten out

Into the fields, whereas I walkt about.

M. Sackuille.

[[Page 368]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=192)

—When ye count ye free from feare,

Comes the breame Winter with chamfered browes,

Full of wrinkles and froſty furrowes,

Shooting his griſly dart,

Which cruddles the blood and pricks the hart.

Ed. Spenſer.

### 1.235. Ianuarie.

— Now ſad Winter welked hath the day,

And Phoebus weary of his yearely taske,

Yſhackled hath his ſteeds in lowly lay,

And taken vp his Inne in fiſhes haske.

Idem.

### 1.236. Autumnus.

The wearied nights approached on a pace,

With darkſome ſhades which ſomwhat breedeth care,

The ſunne hath take more neere the earth his race.

In Libra then his greateſt ſway he bare,

For pardy then the dayes more colder are,

Then fades the greene fruite, liuely hearbs are done,

And Winter gins to waſt that Sommer wone.

I. H. Mir. of Mag.

### 1.237. Sommer. Iulie.

Now the ſunne hath reared vp

his ſiluer footed teame,

Making his wayte betweene the cup

and golden Diademe.

The rampant Lyon hunts he faſt,

with doggs of noyſome breath,

[[Page 369]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=192)VVhoſe
balefull barking brings in haſt,

pine, plague, and drery death.

Edm. Spencer.

### 1.238. August.

That time of yeere when the inamoured ſunne,

Clad in the richeſt roabes of liuing fires,

Courted the Virgin ſigne, great Natures Nunne,

[...]vhich barraines earth, of all that earth deſires:

[...]uen in the month that from Augustus wone

His ſacred name, which vnto heauen aſpi [...]es,

And on the laſt of his tentrebled dayes

W. Shakespeare.

[...]t was the month in which the righteous mayde,

That for diſdaine of ſinfull worlds vpbraid,

[...]ed backe to heauen where ſhe was firſt conceiu'd

[...]nto her ſiluer bower the ſunne receiu'd,

And the hote Syrian dog on him awayting

After the chafed Lyons cruell bayting,

[...]orrupted had the ayre with noyſome breath,

And powrd on earth, plague, peſtilence & dearth.

Rob. Greene.

[...]ow was the month that old Sextilis name

[...]hangd by the Romaine Senates ſage degree,

And glorying ſo to innouate the ſame,

[...]o haue himſelfe new chriſtned did agree,

[...]oude that Augustus God-father ſhould be,

[...] whilſt Ceres clad him in a mantle fayre

Of bearded Corne, ſtill quauering with the ayre.

Char. Fitz Ieffrey.

[[Page 370]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=193)

### 1.239. Iulie.

VVhat time ſleepes Nurſe the ſilent night begun

To ſteale by minutes on the long-liu'd dayes,

The furious dog-ſtarre chaſing of the ſunne,

Whoſe ſcorching breath adds flames vnto his raies,

At whoſe approch the angry Lyon braies,

The earth now warm'd in her celeſtiall fire,

To coole her heate, puts off her rich attire.

M. Drayton.

### 1.240. Of Morpheus.

Morpheus the liuelie ſonne of deadly ſleepe,

VVitnes of life to them that liuing die,

A prophet oft, and oft an hiſtorie;

A Poet eke, as humors flie or creepe.

S. Phil. Sid.

Hee making ſpeedy way through perſed ayre,

And through the world of waters wide and deepe,

To Morpheus houſe doth haſtily repaire,

Amid the bowels of the earth full ſteepe,

And lowe where dawning day doth neuer peepe

His dwelling is; there Thetis her wet bed

Doth euer waſh, and Cynthia ſtill doth ſteepe

In ſiluer dew her euer-dropping head,

vvhile ſad night ouer him her mantle black doth ſpread

Edm. Spencer.

VVhoſe double gates he findeth locked faſt,

The one faire fram'd of burniſh'd Iuorie,

The other, all with ſiluer ouer-caſt,

And wakefull dogs before them fa [...]re doe lie.

[[Page 371]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=193)Watching
to baniſh Care, theyr enemie,

vvho oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.

Idem.

### 1.241. Of Neptune.

Firſt came great Neptune with his three-forkt mace,

That rules the ſeas, and makes them riſe or fall;

His dewey locks did drop with brine a pace

Vnder his diademe imperiall,

And by his ſide his Queene with Coronall,

Fayre Amphitrite, moſt diuinely fayre,

vvhoſe Iuory ſhoulders were couered all

As with a robe, with her owne ſiluer hayre,

And deckt with pearles, which the Indian ſeas for her prepare.

Edm. Spencer.

### 1.242. Of Proteus.

Proteus is ſhepheard of the Seas of yore,

And hath the charge of Neptunes mightie heard

An aged Sire, with head all frothy hoare,

And ſprinckled froſt vpon his dewie beard.

Idem.

### 1.243. Of Thetis.

Thetis the Mother of the pleaſant ſprings,

Grandome of all the Riuers in the world,

To whome earths vaines a moyſtning tribute brings,

Nowe with a mad diſturbed paſſion hurl'd

About her Caue (the worlds great treaſure) flings,

And with wreath'd armes, & long wet haire vncu [...]l'd,

[[Page 372]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=194)Within
herſelfe laments a loſſe vnloſt,

And mones her wrongs, before her ioyes be croſt.

I. Markham.

### 1.244. Of Phoebus.

The golden ofspring of Latona pure,

And ornament of great Ioues progenie,

Phoebus.

Edm. Spencer.

—Dayes King, God of vndaunted verſe.

G. Chapman.

### 1.245. Of Neptune.

O Neptune, neuer like thy ſelfe in ſhew,

Inconſtant, variable, mutable,

How dooſt thou Proteus like thy forme renewe,

O whereto is thy change impurable?

Or whereunto art thou bent ſutable?

Rightly the Moone predominateth thee,

For thou art all as changeable as ſhee.

Ch. Fitz Ieffray.

### 1.246. Of Apollo.

Sacred Apollo, God of Archerie,

Of Arts, of pleaſure, and of Poetrie,

Ioues faire haird ſonne, whoſe yellow treſſes ſhine,

Like curled flames; hurling a moſt diuine

And dazeling ſplendour, in thoſe leſſer fires

Which from thy guilt beames (when thy Car retires,)

Kindle thoſe Tapers that lend eyes to night,

O thou that art the Land-lord of all light,

Birdegroome of morning, dayes eternall King,

[[Page 373]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=194)To whom

In daunces ſphericall trip hand in hand,

Whilſt thy ſeauen-ſtringed Lute theyr feete cōmaund,

That to the muſicke daunce nine heauenly ſpheares.

Great Delian Prieſt, we to adore thy name,

Haue burnt fat thighes of Bulls in hallowed flame,

vvhoſe ſauour wrapt in ſmoake and clowdes of fire

To thy ſtarre-ſpangled Pallace did aſpire.

Tho. Dekkar.

### 1.247. Of Rome.

O thou worlds Queene, ô towne that didſt extend

Thy conquering armes beyond the Ocean,

And througdſt thy conqueſts from the Libian ſhore,

Downe to the Scythian ſwift-foote feareleſſe porters,

Thou art debaſd, and at this inſtant yeelds

Thy proude necke to a miſerable yoke.

Tho. Kyd.

### 1.248. Of Heate.

VVhen Phoebus roſe he left his golden weede,

And dond attire in deepeſt pulple dyed,

His ſanguine beames about his forhead ſpred,

A ſad preſage of ill that ſhould betide,

[...]ith vermile drops at euen his treſſes bleed

[...]or ſhewes of future heate from th'Ocean wide.

[...]hilſt thus he bent gainſt earth his ſcorching raies,

He burnt the flowers, and burnt his Clitia deare,

The leaues grew wan vpon the withered ſpraies,

The graſſe and growing hearbes all parched were.

[[Page 374]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=195)Earth
cleft in rifts, in floods theyr ſtreames decaies,

The barren clowdes with lightning bright appeare,

And mankind feard leaſt Clymens child againe

Had driuen away his Syers ill-guided vvaine.

As from a fornace flew the ſmoake to skies,

Such ſmoake as that when damned Sodome brent:

Within his Caue ſweete Zephyre ſilent lyes,

Still was the ayre, the racke nor came nor went,

But ore the lands with luke-warme breathing flies

The Southerne winde, from ſun-bright Affrique ſent,

vvith thicke and warme, his interrupted blaſts,

Vpon theyr boſoms, throates, and faces caſts.

Nor yet more comfort brought the gloomy night,

In her thicke ſhade was burning heate vprold,

Her ſable mantle was imbrodered bright

vvith blazing ſtarres and gliding fires of gold.

Nor to refreſh ſad earth thy thirſty ſpirit,

The niggard Moone let fall her May-dewes cold,

And dried vp the vitall moiſture was

In trees, in plants, in hearbs, in flowers, in graſſe.

Ed. Fairefax.

### 1.249. Of Thirst.

VVhen wells grew dry, the Commons ran in rage

And ſought out euery ſincke, their thirſt t'aſſwage:

And dranke with lothſome draught the pooles in haſ [...]

To quench theyr thirſt with ill-contented taſt,

vvhich poyſoned ayre infect theyr pureſt breath,

vvhereby the drinker dranke his preſent death:

O wretched folke, who felt ſo hard a ſtrife,

Drinke or not drinke, both waies muſt loſe theyr life,

[[Page 375]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=195)For he
that dranke, and he that did refraine,

Had of theyr enemies both an equall paine:

For why? the water vile ſlew them throughout

No leſſe, then did theyr enemies them about.

That wretched towne had neuer a ſtreet nor vew

But Parcaes there had fram'd ſome faſhions new

To murder men, or martyr them with feares,

As mou'd the moſt indurate hart to teares,

If ſo much water in theyr braines had beene

As might forbeare a drop to wet theyr eyne.

One while he ſpake his hart (for thirſt) did faint:

And life him left, which fruſtrate his complaint.

The ſouldiour braue, (oh hart-breake for to tell)

His proper vrine dranke, thirſt to expell:

The woful mother with her ſpettle fed

Her little child halfe dead in cradle-bed:

The Lady with her Lord at poynt of death,

Embracing falls, and yeelds theyr lateſt breath.

Thom. Hudſon.

### 1.250. Of an Aſſault.

— They no leſſe prouided are within

With rampires, bulwarks, and with doubled dikes:

And where theyr foes to clime doe once begin,

They puſh thē down with bills, with ſtaues, with pikes.

If one be kild, another ſteppeth in,

No man his place for feare of hurt miſlikes,

Some throw downe blocks, ſome ſtones, ſome ſcalding water,

Greeuing them much with all, moſt with the latter,

Some throw among them newly ſlaked Lime,

[[Page 376]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=196)That
burneth moſt, when moſt it ſeemes to quench,

vvith pots of Brimſtone, Pitch and Turpentime,

Annoying them with heate, with ſmoake, & ſtench.

The reſt are ſtill imployd, and looſe no time

vvith wreathed ſtakes to fortifie the Trench:

Thus all within are buſie, all without,

Fortune on both ſides ſtanding ſtill in doubt.

S. I. Harr.

### 1.251. Of an Hoast.

Their hoaſt with arrowes, pykes, and ſtandards ſtood

As briſtle-poynted as a thornie wood,

Theyr multitude of men the riuers died,

vvhich through the wealthy Iuda ſwift did ſlide,

So that flood Iordan finding dry his banke,

For ſhame he bluſht, and downe his head he ſhrank,

For woe that he his credite could not keepe,

To pay one waue for tribute to the deepe.

Tho. Hudſon.

### 1.252. Of a Skirmish,

Then grew the fight on both ſides firme and ſtable,

Both ſides defend, both ſides alike inuade;

They caſt on both ſides dartes innumerable

Making therewith a darke vnpleaſing ſhade,

An endleſſe worke it were to write the rable

The Chriſtians kild with bow, with bill, with blade.

Sometime the ſway goeth hether, ſomtime thether,

Like waters driuen with doubtfull tydes and wether:

VVhen one is ſlaine, his roome another fills,

VVhen one is hurt, another takes his place,

[[Page 377]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=196)And he
that now an other ſmites and kills,

Falls dead him ſelfe within a little ſpace,

Great heapes of bodies dead make little hills:

The earth it ſelfe lookes with a bloody face;

The greene where-with it erſt was ſtored,

Turneth to ſanguine and vermillion red.

S. I. Harrington.

### 1.253. Of Diſcontent.

Diſquiet thoughts the minutes of her watch,

Forth from her Caue the fiend full oft doth flie,

To Kings ſhe goes, and troubles them with warres,

Setting thoſe high aſpiring bonds on fire;

That flame from earth vnto the ſeate of Ioue:

To ſuch as Midas, men that dote on wealth,

And rent the bowels of the middle earth

For coine; who gape as did faire Danae

For ſhowres of gold: there diſcontent in blacke,

Throwes forth the violls of her reſtleſſe cares,

To ſuch as ſit at Paphos for releefe:

And offer Ʋenus many ſolemne vowes,

To ſuch as Hymen in his ſaffron robe,

Hath knit a gordian knot of paſſions,

To theſe, to all, parting the gloomy ayre,

Blacke diſcontent doth make her bad repaire.

R. Greene.

Obſcure and darke is all the gloomy aire,

The curtaine of the night is ouer-ſpread;

The ſilent miſtreſſe of the lowry ſpheare,

Put on her ſable coloured vale and lower,

Nor ſtarre, nor milk-white circle of the skie,

[[Page 378]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=197)Appeares
where Diſcontent doth hold her lodge,

She ſits ſhrin'd in a canapy of clouds,

vvhoſe maſſie darknes mazeth euery ſence,

vvan is her lookes, her cheekes of azure hue,

Her haire as Gorgons foule retorting ſnakes;

Enuie the glaſſe, wherein the hag doth gaze,

Reſtleſſe the clocke that chimes her faſt a ſleepe.

### 1.254. Of Adams feare after his Tranſgreſsion.

At this ſad ſummons, wofull man reſembles,

A bearded ruſh that in a riuer trembles,

His roſie cheekes are chang'd to earthen hue,

His dying body drops an icie dewe;

His teare-drown'd-eyes a night of clouds bedims,

About his eares a burning horror ſwims,

His fainting knees with feeblenes are humble,

His faultring feete doe ſlide away and ſtumble;

He hath not now his free, bold, ſtately port,

But downward lookes in fearefull ſlauiſh ſort;

Now naught of Adam doth in Adam reſt,

He feeles his ſences pain'd, his ſoule oppreſt,

A confuſ'd hoaſt of violent paſſions iarre,

His fleſh and ſpirit are in continuall warre.

And now no more through conſcience of his error:

He heares or ſees, th'almighty but with terror,

And loth he aunſweres (as with tongue diſtraught)

Confeſſing (thus) his feare, but not his fault.

I Syluester.

[[Page 379]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=197)

### 1.255. Of the Vacation.

— At ſuch times when Lawyers walk the ſtreetes

Without long rowles of papers in their hands,

When friendly neighbour with his neighbour meetes,

Without falſe challenge to each others lands,

The Counſellour without his Clyent ſtands:

When that large Capitall lies void and waſt

Where Senatours and Iudges late were plaſt.

Th. Storer.

### 1.256. Ceremonie.

All ſodainly a light of twenty hewes

Brake through the roofe, and like rainebow viewes

Amaz'd Leander; in whoſe beames came downe

The Goddeſſe Ceremonie, with a crowne

Of all the ſtarres, and heauen with her deſcended

Her flaming haire to her bright feete extended,

By which, hung all the bench of deities;

And in a chaine compact of eares and eyes,

She led Religion; all her body was

Cleare and tranſparent as the pureſt glaſſe,

For ſhe was all preſented to the ſence,

Deuotion, order, ſtate, and reuerence

Her ſhadowes were, ſociety, memorie;

All which her ſight made liue, her abſence die,

A rich diſparent pinnacle ſhe weares,

Drawne full of circles and ſtrange characters:

Her face was changeable to euery eye,

One way lookt ill, an other graciouſlie,

Which while men view'd they cheerefull were & holy,

[[Page 380]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=198)But
looking of, vicious and melanchollie;

The ſnakie paths to each obſerued law,

Did pollicie in her broade boſome draw,

One hand a mathematique chriſtall ſwayes,

Which gathering in one line a thouſand rayes;

From her bright eyes confuſion burnes to death,

And all eſtates of men diſtinguiſheth,

By it mortality and comlineſſe,

Them ſelues in all their ſightly figures dreſſe.

Her other hand a Laurell rod applies,

To beate back barbariſme and Auarice:

That followed eating earth and excrement,

And humaine limbs, and would make proud aſcent,

To ſeates of Gods were Ceremonie ſlaine,

The houres and graces bore her glorious traine,

And all the ſweets of our ſocietie,

Were ſpheard and treaſur'd in her bounteous eyes.

G. Chapman.

### 1.257. Of Louers.

VVho with a mayden voyce, and mincing pace,

Quaint lookes, curl'd locks, perfumes, and painted face,

Baſe coward hart, and wanton ſoft aray,

Their manhood onely by their beard bewray,

Are cleanly call'd, who likelieſt greedy Goates

Brothell from bed to bed; whoſe Syren notes

Inchaunt chaſt Suſans, and like hungry Kite

Fly at all game, they Louers are behight.

I. Syluester.

Who beare vpon their French-ſick-backs about,

Farmes, Caſtels, fees in golden ſhields cut out,

[[Page 181]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=198)Whoſe hand
had at one Primeroreſt:

One pompous Turney, or on pampering feaſt.

Spends themſelues, ſcrapt by the vſurie and care

Of miſer parents, liberall counted are.

Idem.

Who by falſe bargaines and vnlawfull meaſures,

Robbing the world, haue heaped kingly treaſures:

Who cheat the ſimple, lend for fifty, fifty

Hundred, for hundred are eſteemed thrifty.

Idem.

### 1.258. Renowne.

A trump more ſhrill then Tritons on the Sea,

The ſaid Renowne precurſour of the traine,

Did ſound (for who rings louder then Renowne:)

He mounted was vpon a flying horſe,

And cloath'd in Faulcons feathers to the ground,

By his Eſcochion iuſtly might you geſſe,

He was the Herauld of Eternity,

And Purſeuant at Armes to mighte Ioue.

G. Peele.

### 1.259. Of Doubt.

— Doubt had a double face,

Th'one forward looking, the other backward bent,

Therein reſembling Ianus auncient,

Which hath in charge the in-gate of the yeare,

And euermore his eyes about him went,

As if ſome prooued perill he did feare,

Or did miſdoubt ſome ill whoſe cauſe did not appeare.

Ed. Spenſer.

[[Page 382]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=199)

### 1.260. Of a Gunne.

Ʋulcan begot me, Minerua me taught,

Nature my mother, Craft nouriſht me yeare by yeare,

Three bodies are my foode, my ſtrength is naught,

Anger, Wrath, Waſt, and Noiſe my children deere,

Geſſe friend what I am, and how I am wrought:

Monſter of ſea, or land, or of elſe-where

Knowe and vſe me, and I may thee defend,

And I be thy enemy I may thy life end.

S. Th. W.

### 1.261. Of an Hargabush,

He hath his other weapons ſtrange among

A trunke of iron hollow made within,

And there he puts powder and pellets in,

All cloſed ſaue a little hole behind,

Whereat no ſooner taken is the flame,

The bullet flies with ſuch a furious wind,

As though from clouds a bolt of thunder came:

And what-ſo-euer in the way it finde,

It burnes it, breakes it, teares it, ſpoiles the ſame;

No doubt ſome fiend of hell or deuilliſh wight

Deuiſed it, to doe mankind a ſpight.

S. I. Harrington,

### 1.262. Of an Horſe.

Round hoof'd, ſhort ioynted, fetlocks ſhag and long,

Broad breaſt, full eye, ſmall head, and noſthrils wide,

High creſt, ſhort eares, ſtraite leggs, and paſſing ſtrong▪

Thin maine, thick taile, broad buttock, tender hide;

[[Page 383]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=199)Looke what
an horſe ſhould haue he did not lacke

Saue a proud rider on ſo proud a backe.

W. Shakespeare.

Among a hundred braue, light, luſty horſes,

(With curious eye marking their comly forces)

He chooſeth one for his induſtrious proofe,

With round, high, hollow, ſmooth, browne, ielly hoofe,

vvith paſternes ſhort, vpright, but yet in meane,

Dry ſinewie ſhanks, ſtrong fleſhleſſe knees and leane,

vvith hart-like leggs, broad breaſt, and large behinde,

vvith body large, ſmooth flanks, and double chinde:

A creſted necke bowed like a halfe bent bowe,

vvhereon a long thin curled maine doth flowe;

A firme full taile touching the lowly ground,

vvith dock betweene two faire fat buttocks drownd;

A pricked eare, that reſts as little ſpace

As his light foote; a leane bare bony face,

Thin iowle, and head but of a middling ſize

Full liuely flaming, quickly rowling eyes,

Great foaming mouth, hote fuming noſthrill wide,

Of cheſt-nut haire, his forehead ſtarrified;

Three milky feete, a feather on his breſt,

vvhom ſeauen yeares old at the next graſſe he geſt.

I. Syluester.

### 1.263. Of a ſtarued man.

His ſad dull eyes deepe ſunke in hollow pits,

Could not endure the vnwonted ſunne to view,

His bare thin cheekes for want of belly-bits,

And empty ſides deceaued of their due,

Could make a ſtony hart his hap to rue;

[[Page 384]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=200)His raw
bone armes whoſe mighty brawnie bowres,

Were wont to riue ſteele plates and helmets hewe,

Were cleane conſum'd, and all his vitall parts

Decai'd, & all his fleſh ſhrunk vp like withered flowers.

Ed. Spenſer.

### 1.264. Of the confuſion of languages.

This ſaid, as ſoone confuſedly did bound,

Through all the work, I wote not what ſtrange ſound,

A iangling noyſe, not much vnlike the rumors

Of Bacchus Swaines, amid their drunken humors:

Some ſpeake betweene the teeth, ſome in the noſe:

Some in the throate their words doe ill diſpoſe:

Some howle and cry, and ſome ſtut and ſtraine,

Each hath his gibberiſh, and all ſtriue in vaine.

To finde againe their knowne beloued tong,

That with their milk they ſuckt in cradle yong:

Ariſe betimes while th'opal-coloured morne,

In golden pompe dooth May dayes doore adorne;

And patient, heare th'all differing voyces ſweet

Of painted fingers, that in Groues doe greete:

There loue Bon-iours each in his phraſe and faſhion,

From trembling pearch, vttering his earneſt paſſion,

And ſo thou mayeſt conceite what mingle mangle

Among this people euery where did iangle.

Bring me (quoth one) a trowell, quickly, quicke,

One brings him vp a hammer; hew this bricke

Another bids, and then they cleaue a tree:

Make faſt this rope, and then they let it flee,

One calls for planks, another morter lacks:

They beare the firſt a ſtone, the laſt an axe,

[[Page 385]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=200)One would
haue ſpikes, and him a ſpade they gaue,

Another askes a ſawe, and gets a ſiue;

Thus croſly croſt, they prate and poynt in vaine,

vvhat one hath made, another marrs againe,

Nigh breathleſſe all, with theyr confuſed yawling

In booteleſſe labour, now begins appawling.

I. Syluester.

### 1.265. Of Posteritie.

Daughter of Time, ſincere Poſteritie,

Alwayes new borne, yet no man knowes thy birth,

The arbitreſſe of pure Sinceritie,

Yet, changeable, (like Proteus) on the earth,

Sometime in plenty, ſometime ioynd with dearth.

Alwayes to come, yet alwayes preſent heere,

Whom all runne after, none come after neere.

Vnpartiall Iudge of all ſaue preſent ſtate,

Truth's Idioma of the things are paſt,

But ſtill purſuing preſent things with hate,

And more iniurious at the firſt then laſt,

Preſeruing others, while thine owne do waſt:

True treaſurer of all antiquitie,

Whom all deſire, yet neuer o [...] could ſee.

Char. Fitz Ieffrey.

### 1.266. Diſcriptions of Beautie & perſonage.

VVhat tongue can her perfections tell

[...]n whoſe each part all pennes may dwell?

Her hayre fine threds of fineſt gold

[...]n curled knots, mens thoughts to hold,

[...]ut that her forehead ſaies, in mee,

[[Page 386]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=201)A whiter
beautie you may ſee.

vvhiter indeed: more white then ſnow

vvhich on cold winters face doth grow:

That doth preſent thoſe euen browes,

vvhoſe equall line their angles bowes

Like to the Moone, when after change

Her horned head abroade doth range;

And arches be to heauenly lids,

vvhoſe wincke each bold attempt forbids.

For the black ſtarres thoſe ſpheres containe

The matchleſſe paire euen praiſe doth ſtaine.

No lampe whoſe light by art is got,

No ſunne which ſhines and ſetteth not,

Can liken them without all peere

Saue one as much as other cleere,

vvhich onely thus vnhappy bee,

Becauſe themſelues they cannot ſee.

Her cheekes which kindly claret ſpred,

Aurora like new out of bed,

Or like the freſh Queene apples ſide,

Bluſhing at ſight of Phoebus pride.

Her noſe her chin, pure Iuory weares

No purer then the prety eares:

So that therein appeares ſome blood

Like wine and milke that mingled ſtood:

In whoſe incircles if yee gaze

Your eyes may tread a Louers maze:

But with ſuch turnes the voyce to ſtray,

No talke vntaught can finde the way,

The lippe no iewell needes to weare,

The lippe is iewell of the eare.

[[Page 387]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=201)But who
thoſe ruddy lips can miſſe?

which bleſſed ſtill themſelues doe kiſſe,

Rubies, cherries, and roſes new,

[...]n worth, in taſt, in perfect hew:

which neuer part but that they ſhow

Of precious pearles the double row:

The ſecond ſweetly fenced ward,

Her heauenly dewed tongue to gard,

whence neuer word in vaine did flow:

[...]aire vnder theſe doth ſtately grow

The handle of this precious work,

The necke in which ſtrange graces lurke.

[...]uch be I thinke the ſumptuous Towres

[...]hich skill doth make in Princes bowres:

[...]o good a ſay inuites the eye

[...] little downeward to eſpie

The liuely cluſters of her breſts,

[...]f Venus babe the wanton neſts.

[...]ike pommels rounde of marble cleere,

[...]here azurde vaines well mixt appeare,

[...]ith deareſt tops of Porphirie

[...]etwixt theſe two away doe lie:

[...]way more worthy beauties fame,

[...]hen that which beares the milkie name,

[...]his leades vnto the ioyous field

[...]hich onely ſtill doth Lillies yeeld,

[...]t Lillies ſuch whoſe natiue ſmell

[...]he Indian odours doth excell:

[...]aſt it is calld, for it doth waſt

[...]ens liues vntill it be imbraſt.

[...]here may one ſee, and yet not ſee

[[Page 388]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=202)Her ribs
in white all armed be,

More white then Neptunes foamy face

vvhen ſtrugling, rocks he would imbrace.

In thoſe delights the wandring thought

Might of each ſide aſtray be brought,

But that her nauell doth vnite

In curious circle, buſie ſight:

A daintie ſeale of Virgine waxe,

vvhere nothing but impreſsion lacks.

Her belly there glad ſight doth fill,

Iuſtly intituled Cupids hill:

A hill moſt fit for ſuch a maiſter,

A ſpotleſſe Mine of Alablaſter.

Like Alablaſter fayre and ſleeke,

But ſoft and ſubtile, Satten like:

In that ſweete ſea the boy doth ſport,

Loth I muſt leaue his cheefe reſort,

For ſuch a vſe the world hath gotten,

The beſt things ſtill muſt be forgotten.

Yet neuer ſhall my ſong omit

Her thighes, for Ouids ſong more fit,

Which flanked with two ſugred flancks

Lift vp theyr ſtately ſwelling banks,

That Albion cliffes in whitenes paſſe,

vvith hanches ſmooth as looking-glaſſe.

But bow all knees, now of her knees

My tongue doth tell what fancie ſees,

The knots of ioy, the iems of loue,

Whoſe motion makes all graces moue:

vvhoſe bought incau'd doth yeeld ſuch ſight,

Like cunning painter ſhadowing white.

[[Page 389]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=202)The
gartring place with child-like ſigne

Shewes eaſie print in mettall fine:

But then againe the fleſh doth riſe

In her braue calues, like chriſtall skies,

vvhoſe Atlas is a ſmalleſt ſmall,

More white then whiteſt bone of all.

Thereout ſteales out that round cleane foote,

This noble Cedars precious roote,

In ſhew and ſent, pale Violets,

Whoſe ſteppe on earth all beauty ſets.

But backe vnto her backe my Muſe,

vvhere Ledas ſwan his feathers mewes,

Along whoſe ridge ſuch bones are met

Like Comfets round in Marchpane ſet.

Her ſhoulders be like two white Doues

Pearching in ſquare royall rooues,

Which leaded are with ſiluer skin

Paſſing the hate-ſpot Ermelin.

And thence thoſe armes deriued are,

The Phenixe wings are not ſo rare

For faultleſſe length and ſtaineleſſe hue;

Ah woe is mee, my woes renew.

Now courſe doth leade me to her hand,

Of my firſt loue the fatall band,

vvhere whitenes doth for euer ſit,

Nature her ſelfe inameld it:

For there, with ſtrange compact doth lie

Warme ſnow, moiſt pearle, ſoft Iuorie.

There fall thoſe Saphire coloured brookes,

Which conduit like with curious crookes

Sweete Ilands make in that ſweet land.

[[Page 390]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=203)As for he
fingers of the hand,

The bloody ſhafts of Cupids war,

vvith Amathiſts they headed are.

Thus hath each part his beauties part.

But now the Graces doe impart

To all her limms a ſpeciall grace,

Becomming euery time and place.

vvhich doth euen beauty beautifie,

And moſt bewitch the wretched eye.

Now all this is but a faire Inne,

Of fayreſt gueſts which dwell therein:

Of whoſe high praiſe, and praiſefull bliſſe,

Goodnes the pen, heauen paper is,

The Incke immortall fame doth lend.

As I began, ſo muſt I end:

No tongue can her perfections tell,

In whoſe each part all pens may dwell.

S. Phil. Sidney.

Her face ſo faire, as fleſh it ſeemed not,

But heauenly pourtrait of bright Angels hue,

Cleere as the skie, withouten blame or blot,

Through goodly mixture of complexions due,

And in her cheekes the vermell red did ſhow,

Like roſes in a bed of Lillies ſhed,

The which Ambroſiall odours from her threw,

And gazers ſence with double pleaſure fed,

Able to heale the ſick, and to reuiue the dead.

In her faire eyes two liuing lamps did flame,

Kindled aboue, at th'heauenly Makers light,

And darted fiery beames about the ſame

So paſſing perſant, and ſo wondrous bright,

[[Page 391]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=203)That quite
bereau'd the raſh beholders ſight.

In them the blinded God his luſtfull fire

To kindle oft aſſaide but had no might,

For with dread maieſtie and awful ire

Shee broke his wanton ſhafts & quencht his baſe deſire.

Her Iuory forhead, ful of bounty braue

Like a broade table did it ſelfe diſpread,

For loue his loftie tryumphs to ingraue,

And write the battailes of his great god-head,

All good and honour might therein be read,

For there their dwelling was. And when ſhe ſpake,

Sweet words like dropping honney ſhe did ſhed,

And twixt the pearles and Rubies ſoftly broke

A ſiluer ſound that heauenly muſick ſeemd to make.

Vpon her eye-lids many graces ſate

Vnder the ſhadow of her euen browes,

Working belgards and amorous retrate,

And euery one her with a grace endowes,

And euery one with meekenes to her bowes:

So glorious mirror of celeſtiall grace,

And ſoueraigne monument of mortal vowes,

How ſhal fraile pen deſcribe her heauenly face,

For feare through want of skil her beauty to diſgrace?

So faire, and thouſand thouſand times more faire

Shee ſeem'd, when ſhe preſented was to ſight,

And was yclad for heate of ſcorching ayre

All in a ſilken Camous, lilly white,

Purfled vpon with many a folded plight:

Which al aboue beſprinckled was throughout

vvith golden aygulets that gliſtered bright

Like twinckling ſtarres: and al the skyrt about

[[Page 392]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=204)vvas hemd
about with golden frindge.

Below her hamme her weede did ſomewhat traine,

And her ſtraite leggs moſt brauely were embaild

In gilden Buskins of coſtly Cordwaine,

All bard with golden bends which were entaild

vvith curious antiques, and full fayre aumaild.

Before they faſtned were vnder her knee

In a rich Iewell, and therein intrailde

The ends of all theyr knots, that none might ſee

How they within theyr foldings cloſe enwrapped bee:

Like two fayre Marble pillers they were ſeene,

vvhich doe the temple of the Gods ſupport,

vvhom all the people deck with garlands greene:

Thoſe ſame with ſtately grace and princely port

Shee taught to tread when ſhe herſelfe would grace.

But with the wooddy Nimphs when ſhe did play,

Or when the flying Libbard ſhe did chace,

Shee could then nimbly mooue, and after flie a pace.

VVithin her hand a ſharp Bore-ſpeare ſhe held,

And at her back a bow and quiuer gay,

Shaft with ſteele-headed darts, wherewith ſhe queld

The ſauage beaſts in her victorious play:

Knit with a golden bauldrick, which forlay

Athwart the ſnowy breaſt, and did deuide

Her dainty paps, which like young fruite in May

Now little gan to ſwell; and beeing tyde,

Through her thin weede theyr places ſignified.

Her yellow locks criſped, like golden wyre,

About her ſhoulders weren looſely ſhed,

And when the winde amongſt them did inſpyre,

They waued like a Penon wide deſpred,

[[Page 393]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=204)And low
behinde her backe were ſcattered:

And whether art it were, or heedeleſſe hap,

As through the flowring forreſt raſh ſhe fled,

In her rude haires ſweete flowers did wrap

Such as Diana by the ſandy ſhore

Of ſwift Eurotas, or on Cynthus greene;

vvhere all the Nimphs haue her vnwares forlore,

Wandreth alone, with bowes and arrowes keene

To ſeeke her game: or as that famous Queene

Of Amazons, whom Pyrhus did deſtroy

The day that firſt of Priam ſhee was ſeene,

Did ſhew herſelfe in great tryumphant ioy,

To ſuccour the weake ſtate of ſad-afflicted Troy.

Edm. Spencer.

Her yellow locks exceede the beaten gold,

Her ſparkling eyes in heauen a place deſerue,

Her forhead high and faire, of comely mold:

her words are muſicall, of ſiluer ſound,

her wit ſo ſharp, as like can ſcarce be found.

Each eye-brow hangs like Iris in the skyes,

Her Eagles noſe is ſtraite, of ſtately frame,

On eyther cheeke a Roſe and Lilly lyes,

Her breath is ſweet perfume, or holy flame:

her lips more red then any Corrall ſtone,

her necke more white then aged Swans that mone.

Her breaſt tranſparent is, like chriſtall rock,

Her fingers long, fit for Apollos Lute,

Her ſlipper ſuch as Momus dare not mock,

Her vertues are ſo great, as make me mute.

vvhat other parts ſhe hath, I neede not ſay,

vvhoſe faireſt face alone is my decay.

Tho. Watſon.

Like to the cleere in higheſt ſpheare

vvhere al imperious glory ſhines,

Of ſelfe ſame colour is her hayre

vvhether vnfolded or in twines:

Her eyes are Saphyres ſet in ſnow,

Refyning heauen by euery winke,

The Gods doe feare when as they glow,

And I doe tremble when I thinke.

Her cheekes are like the bluſhing clowde

That beautifies Auroras face,

Or like the ſiluer crimſon ſhrowde

That Phoebus ſmiling locks doe grace:

Her lips are like two budded Roſes

Whom ranks of Lillies neighbour nie,

vvhich with bounds ſhe ſtil incloſes,

Apt to intice a deitie.

Her necke is like a ſtately towre,

vvhere Loue himſelfe in pleaſure lies,

To watch for glaunces euery howre

From her diuine and ſacred eyes.

Her paps are centers of delight,

Her paps are rocks of heauenly flame,

vvhere Nature moulds the dew of light

To feede perfection with the ſame:

With orient pearle, with Rubie red,

vvith Marble white, with azure blew,

Her body euery way is fed,

Yet ſoft in touch, and ſweet in view:

Nature herſelfe her ſhape admires,

The Gods are wounded in her ſight,

And Loue forſakes his heauenly fires,

[[Page 395]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=205)And at her
eyes his brands doth light.

D. Lodge.

She lay and ſeemd a flood of Diamant

Bounded in fleſh: as ſtil as Ʋeſpers haire

When not an Aſpen leafe is ſtird with ayre:

She lay at length, like an immortal ſoule

At endleſſe reſt in bleſt Elizium,

And then did true felicitie inroule

So faire a Lady, figure of her kingdom.

Now as ſhe lay attirde in nakednes

His eye did carue him on that feaſt of feaſts,

Sweet fieldes of life which deaths foote dare not preſſe,

Flowrd with th'vnbroken waues of my loues breaſts,

See wherewith bent of gold curld into knots.

In her heads groue the ſpring-bird Lameat neſts,

Her body doth preſent thoſe fields of peace

vvhere ſoules are feaſted with the ſoule of eaſe.

To proue which Paradice that nurſeth theſe,

See ſee the golden riuers that renowne it,

Rich Gyhon, Tigris, Phiſon, Euphrates,

Two from her bright Pelopian ſhoulders crowne it,

And two out of her ſnowy hills doe glide,

That with a deluge of delight doe drowne it:

Theſe higheſt two their precious ſtreames deuide

To tenne pure floods that do the body dutie,

Bounding themſelues in length, but not in beauty.

Theſe wind theyr courſes through the paynted bowers,

And raiſe ſuch ſounds in theyr inflection

As ceaſeleſſe ſtart from earth freſh ſorts of flowers,

And bound that booke of life with euery ſection.

In theſe the Muſes dare not ſwim for drowning,

[[Page 396]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=206)Theyr
ſweetnes poyſons with ſuch ſweet infection,

And leaues the onely lookers on them ſwouning,

Theſe formes and colour makes them ſo to ſhine,

That Gods for them, would ceaſe to be diuine.

G. Chapman.

Her Lilly hand her roſie cheekes lie vnder,

Cooſning the pillow of a lawfull kiſſe,

Who therefore angry, ſeemes to part in ſunder,

Swelling on eyther ſide to want his bliſſe,

Betweene whoſe hills her head entombed is;

Where, like a vertuous monument ſhe lyes,

To be admirde of lewd vnhallowed eyes.

VVithout the bed her other fayre hand was

On the greene Couerlet, whoſe perfect white

Shewd like an Aprill daiſie on the graſſe,

vvith pearlie ſweat, reſembling dewe of night;

Her eyes like Marigolds had ſheath'd theyr light:

And canopied in darknes, ſweetly lay,

Till they might open to adorne the day.

Her haire like golden threds, playd with her breath,

(O modeſt wantons, wanton modeſtie)

Shewing lifes tryumph in the Map of death,

And deaths dim lookes in lifes mortalitie:

Each in her ſleepe themſelues ſo beautifie

As if betweene them twaine there were no ſtrife,

But that life liu'd in death, and death in life.

Her breaſts like Iuory globes circled with blew,

A payre of mayden worlds vnconquered,

Saue of theyr Lord, no bearing yoke they knew,

And him by oath they truly honoured:

Theſe worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred:

[[Page 397]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=206)vvho like
a foule vſurper went about

From this faire throne to heaue the owner out.

W. Shakespeare.

Starres fall to fetch freſh light from her rich eyes,

Her bright brow driues the ſunne to clowdes beneath,

Her haires reflexe, with red ſtrakes paint the skies,

Sweet morne and euening dew falls from her breath.

T. Naſh.

Fayrer then Iſaacks louer at the vvell,

Brighter then inſide barke of new hewen Cedar,

Sweeter then flames of fire-perfumed Mirrhe,

And comlier then the ſiluer clowdes that daunce

On Zephyrus wings before the King of heauen.

G. Peele.

Her lookes were like beames of the morning ſunne

Forth-looking through the windowes of the Eaſt,

When firſt the fleecie cattell haue begunne

Vpon the pearled graſſe to make theyr feaſt:

Her thoughts are like the fume of Francenſence,

Which from a golden Cenſor forth did riſe:

And throwing forth ſweet odours, mounts from thence

In rolling globes vp to the vaulted skies:

There ſhe beholds with hie aſpyring thought,

The cradle of her owne creation:

Among the ſeates of Angels, heauenly wrought,

Much like an Angell in all forme and faſhion.

S. Daniell.

Her locks are pleighted like the fleece of wooll

That Iaſon with his Grecian mates atchiu'd,

As pure as gold, yet not from gold deriu'd,

As full of ſweets, as ſweet of ſweetes is full:

[[Page 398]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=207)Her browes
are prety tables of conceate,

Where Loue his records of delight doth quote,

On them her dallying locks doe daily floate,

As loue ful oft doth feede vpon the baite▪

Her eyes, faire eyes, like to the pureſt lights

That animate the ſunne, or cheere the day,

In whom the ſhining ſun-beames brightly play

vvhilſt fancie doth on them deuine delights.

Her cheekes like ripened Lillies ſteept in wine,

Or fayre Pomegranate kirnels waſht in milke,

Or ſnow-white threds in nets of Crimſon ſilke,

Or gorgeous clowdes vpon the ſunnes decline.

Her lips like Roſes ouer-waſht with dew,

Or like the Purple of Narciſſus flowre,

No froſt theyr faire, no wind doth wreſt theyr powre,

But by her breath theyr beauties do renew.

Her chriſtal chin like to the pureſt mould

Enchaſt with dainties, Daiſies ſoft and white,

Where Fairies faire pauilion once is pight,

Whereas embraſd his beauties he doth hold.

Her necke like to an Iuory ſhining towre,

Where through with azure vaines ſweet Nectar runnes,

Or like the downe of ſwanns,

Or like delight that doth it ſelfe deuoure.

Her paps are like fayre apples in the prime,

As round as orient pearles, as ſoft as downe,

They neuer vaile theyr faire through winters frowne,

But from theſe ſweets Loue ſuckt his ſommer time:

Her bodies beauties beſt eſteemed bowre,

Delicious, comely, dainty, without ſtaine,

The thought whereof (not toucht) hath wrought my paine.

[[Page 399]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=207)Whoſe face
ſo faire all beauties doth diſtaine,

Her maiden wombe the dwelling houſe of pleaſure,

Not like, for why no like ſurpaſſeth wonder:

O bleſt is he may bring ſuch beauties vnder,

Or ſearch by ſuite the ſecrets of that treaſure.

R. Greene.

Like to Diana in her ſommer weede

Girt with a Crimſon robe of brighteſt die

goes fayre Samela,

As fayre Aurora in her morning gray,

Deckt with the ruddy luſtre of her loue

is fayre Samela,

Like louely Thetis on a calmed day,

When as her brightnes Neptunes fancie moues,

Shines faire Samela.

Her treſſes gold, her eyes like glaſſie ſtreames,

Her teeth are pearle, the breaſts are Iuory

of faire Samela.

Her cheekes like roſie-lillies yeeld forth gleames,

Her browes bright arches, framde of Ebonie,

thus faire Samela.

Paſſeth faire Ʋenus in her braueſt hue,

And Iuno in the ſhew of maieſtie,

for ſhe is Samela.

Pallas in wit, all three if you will view,

For beauty wit, and matchleſſe dignitie,

yeeldes faire Samela.

D. Lodge.

Their ſoft young cheeke-balls to the eye,

Are of the freſh vermilion die,

So Lillies out of Scarlet peere,

[[Page 400]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=208)So Roſes
bloomd in Lady Vere:

So ſhot two wanton ſtarres yfere,

In the eternall burning Sphere.

G. Chapman.

Her eyes like Gemini attend on Ioue,

Her ſtately front was figured from aboue:

Her dainty noſe of Iuory faire and ſheene,

Bepurfurate with ruddy Roſes beene.

Her cherry lips doth daunt the morning dew,

From whence a breath ſo pleaſant doth enſue

As that which layd fayre Pſyches in the vale,

Whom Cupid woed, and woed to his auaile:

Within the compaſſe of which hollow ſweet,

Thoſe orient rancks of ſiluer perles do meet,

Prefixing like prefixion to the eye,

As ſiluer clowd amidſt the ſommers skie,

From whence ſuch words in wiſedome couched be,

As Gods from thence fetch theyr Phyloſophie.

Her dimpled chin of Alablaſter white,

Her ſtately necke, where nature did acquite

Her ſelfe ſo well, as that at ſuddaine ſight

Shee wiſht the worke were ſpent vpon herſelfe,

Her cunning thus was ſhowed vpon the ſhelfe;

For in this hand was fancie painted faire▪

In eyther hand an azure hand ſhe bare.

By one, repeating many a ſweete conſent,

By th'other, comfort to the hart ſhe ſent:

From which a ſeemely paſſage there doth flow

To ſtrangers pleaſures that are placſt below;

Like to the furrow Phaeton did leaue

Amidſt the Welkin, when he did receaue

[[Page 401]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=208)His
Fathers charge, and ſet the world on fire.

In this fayre path oft paced ſweet deſire,

At euery turne beholding with delight

That marble mount that did affect the ſight.

Of Virgine waxe the ſweet impreſſion was,

The cunning compaſſe thereof did ſurpaſſe,

For arte concluding all perfections there,

Writ this report, all graces dwelleth heere.

Which Cupid ſpying, built his manſion ſo,

As ſcorning thoſe ſweet graces to beſtow

On mortall man, with bow ybent doth waite

Leaſt Ioue ſhould ſteale impreſſions by deceit,

And wondring at the criſped Comet faire,

In thought concludes it meeter for the ayre

Then mortall mould: next with the ſtately thighes,

Like two fayre compaſt marble pillars riſe,

Whoſe white doth ſtaine the dainty driuen ſnow;

Next which the knees with luſtie bent below

Conioynd with nerues and cordes of Amber ſweet,

Theſe ſtately piles with gladſome honour greet:

Such ſtately knees as when they bend alite,

All knees doe bend and bow with ſtrange delight.

Her calues with ſtranger compaſſe doe ſucceede,

In which the azure ſtreames a wonder breede,

Both arte and nature therein laboured haue

To paint perfection in her colours braue.

Next which, the prety ground-worke of the pyle

Doth ſhow it ſelfe, and wonder doth beguile;

The ioynts whereof combinde of Amber ſweet,

With Corrall cords yeeld bent to ſeemely feete,

From which who liſt to lift his gazing eye,

[[Page 402]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=209)Shall
greater cauſe of wonder ſoone eſpy:

When on the backe he bends his wauering looke

In which the worke and taske Diana tooke

vvhen with Arachne for the prize ſhe ſtraue,

Both arte and nature there excellence haue;

Where from Pigmalions image ſeemelie white,

vvhoſe cloſe conueyance paſſing Gordians plight,

vvhere louely Nectar, drinke for all the Gods,

vvhere euery Grace is ſtained there by ods,

vvill not content which gazing looke for more,

And ſpy thoſe armes that ſtand his ſight before

vvhich for their mould th'Egyptian wonders paſſe,

Which for their beauty ſtaine the chriſtall glaſſe,

vvhich in theyr boſome couer natures ſweet,

vvhere bluſhing ſtreames preſent a ſecret meet,

vvill now amazde, conclude at laſt of this,

That in the hands all grace concluded is:

vvhere nature limits euer fatall time,

vvhere fortune figures pleaſure in her prime,

vvhence ſpread thoſe fingers typt with Iuory,

vvhoſe touch Meduſas turne may well ſupply:

vvhere to conclude, now all the ſhepheards deeme

All grace, all beauty, all perfections ſeeme.

D. Lodge.

Yet neuer eye to Cupids ſeruice vowde

Beheld a face of ſuch a louely pride:

A Tynſill vale her golden locks did ſhrowde,

That ſtroue to couer what it could not hide:

The golden ſunne behind a ſiluer clowde,

So ſtreameth out his beames on euery ſide,

The marble goddeſſe ſet at Cnidos naked

[[Page 403]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=209)Shee
ſeemd; were ſhe vncloth'd, or that awaked.

The gameſome winde among her treſſes plaies,

And curleth vp thoſe growing riches ſhort,

Her ſparefull eye to ſpread his beames denaies,

But keepes his ſhot where Cupid keepes his fort.

F. G.

Shee was a woman in her freſheſt age

Of wondrous beauty, and of bounty rare,

vvith goodly grace and comly perſonage

That was on earth not eaſie to compare,

Full of great loue, but Cupids wanton ſnare

As hell ſhe hated: chaſt in word and will,

Her necke and breaſts were euer open bare,

That aye thereof her babes might ſuck theyr fill,

The reſt was all in yellow robes araied ſtill.

Edm. Spencer.

A ſhape whoſe like in waxe was hard to frame,

Or to expreſſe by skill of Painters rare;

Her hayre was long and yellow to the ſame,

As might with wyer of beaten gold compare:

Her louely cheekes with ſhew of modeſt ſhame,

vvith Roſes and with Lillyes painted are.

Her forhead faire, and full of ſeemely cheere,

As ſmooth as polliſht Iuory doth appeare:

Vnder two arches of moſt curious faſhion

Stand two black eyes, that like two cleere ſuns ſhind.

Steddy in looke, but apt to take compaſſion,

Amid which lights the naked boy and blind

Caſteth his darts that cauſe ſo many a paſſion,

Leauing a ſweet and cureleſſe wound behind,

From whence the noſe in ſuch good ſort deſcended▪

[[Page 404]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=210)As enuy
knowes not how it may be mended.

Vnder the which, in due and comly ſpace

Standeth the mouth, ſtainde with vermilion hew,

Two rowes of pearles ſerue in theyr place,

Hence come the courteous words and full of grace

That mollifie hard harts and make them new:

From hence proceed thoſe ſmilings ſweet and nice,

That ſeeme to make an earthly Paradice.

Her breſts as milke, her necke as white as ſnow,

Round was her necke, moſt plum and large her breaſt,

Two Iuory apples ſeemed there to grow,

Tender and ſmooth, and fitteſt to be preſt,

Wauing like ſeas when wind moſt calme doth blow.

Argos himſelfe might not diſcerne the reſt,

Yet by preſumption well it might be geſt

That that which was concealed was the beſt.

Her armes due meaſure of proportion bare,

Her fayre white hand was to be viewed plaine,

The fingers long, the ioynts ſo curious are

As neyther knot appeard nor ſwelling vaine,

And full to perfect all thoſe features rare,

The foote that to be ſeene doth ſole remaine,

Slender and ſhort, little it was and round,

A finer foote might no where well be found.

S. I. Harr.

Apollo when my miſtris firſt was borne

Cut off his locks, and left them on her head,

And ſayd, I plant theſe wyres in natures ſcorne,

Whoſe luſtre ſhall appeare when time is dead:

From forth the chriſtall heauen when ſhe was made,

The puritie thereof did taint her brow,

[[Page 405]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=210)On which
the gliſtering that ſought the ſhade

Gan ſet, and there his glories doth avow.

Thoſe eyes, fayre eyes, too faire to be deſcrib'd,

Were thoſe that erſt the Chaos did reforme,

To whom the heauens theyr beauties haue aſcribd,

That faſhion life in man, in beaſt, in worme,

When firſt her fayre delicious cheekes were wrought,

Aurora brought her bluſh, the Moone her white,

Both ſo combinde as paſſed natures thought,

Compild thoſe prety orbes of ſweet delight:

When loue and nature once were proud with play,

From forth theyr lips, her lips their colour drew,

On them doth fancie ſleepe, and euery day

Doth ſwallow ioy ſuch ſweet delights to view.

While one while Venus ſonne did ſeeke a bowre

To ſport with Pſyches his deſired deere,

He choſe her chin, and from that happy ſtowre

He neuer ſtints in glory to appeare.

Deſires and ioyes that long had ſerued loue,

Beſought a hold where prety eyes might wooe them,

Loue made her neck, and for her beſt behoue

Hath ſhut them there where no man can vndoe them.

Once Ʋenus dreamd vpon two prety things,

Her thoughts, they were affections cheefeſt neſts,

She ſuckt and ſigh'd, and bath'd her in the ſprings,

And when ſhe wakt, they were my miſtres breaſts.

Once Cupid ſought a hold to couch his kiſſes,

And found the body of my beſt belou'd,

Wherein he cloyd the beauty of his bliſſes,

And from that bower can neuer be remou'd.

The Graces erſt when Acidalian ſprings

[[Page 406]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=211)vvere
wexen dry, perhaps did finde her fountaine

Within the bale of bliſſe, where Cupids wings

Doe ſhield the Nectar fleeting from the fountaine.

R. Greene.

Her curious locks of gold like Tagus ſands,

Her forhead ſmooth and white as Iuory,

vvhere glory, ſtate, and baſhfulnes held hands:

Her eyes, one making peace, the other wars,

By Ʋenus one, the other ruld by Mars.

Her Eagles noſe, her ſcarlet cheeke halfe white,

Her teeth of orient pearle, her gracious ſmile,

Her dimpled chin, her breaſt as cleere as light,

Her hand like hers whom Titan did beguile.

Tho. Watſon.

Queene Vertues caue which ſome call Stellas face

Repaird by natures cheefeſt furniture,

Hath his forfront of Alablaſter pure,

Gold is the couering of that ſtately place:

The doore by which ſometimes runnes forth her grace,

Red Porphirie which lock of pearle makes ſure,

Whoſe porches rich which name of cheekes endure,

Marble-mixt red and white doe interlace.

The windowes now through which this heauenly gueſ [...]

Lookes on the world, and can finde nothing ſuch

vvhich dare claime from thoſe ſights the name of beſt,

Of touch they are that without touch do touch,

vvhich Cupids ſelfe from beauties mine did draw,

Of touch they are, and poore I, am theyr ſtraw.

S. Phil. Sidney.

[[Page 407]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=211)

Two ſunnes at once from one faire heauen there ſhind,

Ten branches from two boughes tipt all with roſes,

Pure locks, more golden then is gold refinde,

Two pearled rowes that natures pride incloſes;

Two mounts faire marble, white downe, ſoft & dainty,

Full wofull makes my hart, and body fainty.

D. Lodge.

O ſhee doth teach the torches to burne bright,

It ſeemes ſhe hangs vpon the cheeke of night

As a rich Iewell in an Ethiops eare,

Beauty too rich for vſe, for earth too deare:

So ſhowes a ſnowy Doue trooping with crowes,

As yonder Lady ore her fellowes ſhowes.

W. Shakespeare.

To make the wondrous power of heauen appeare

In nothing more then her perfections found,

Cloſe to her nauill ſhe her mantle wreſts,

Slacking it vpwards, and the folds vnwound,

Showing Latonas twins, her plenteous breſts:

The Sunne and Cynthia in their tryumph robes

Of Lady skin more rich then both theyr globes.

G. Chapman.

Vpon a bed of Roſes ſhe was layd,

As faint through heate, or dight to pleaſant ſin,

And was araide, or rather diſaraid

All in a vaile of ſilke and ſiluer thin,

That hid no whit her Alablaſter skin,

But rather ſhowd more white, if more might be;

More ſubtile web Arachne cannot ſpin,

Nor the fine nets which oft we wouen ſee

Of ſcorched dew, do not in th'ayre more lightly flie.

[[Page 408]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=212)Her ſnowy
breaſt was bare to ready ſpoyle

Of hungry eyes, which not therewith be fild,

And yet through languor of her late ſweet toyle,

Few drops more cleere then Nectar forth diſtild,

That like pure orient pearles adowne it thrild,

Fraile harts yet quenched not, like ſtarry light,

which ſparkling on the ſilent waues, doe ſeeme more bright.

Edm. Spen.

Her Iuory necke, her Alablaſter breaſt,

Her paps, which like white ſilken pillowes were,

For loue in ſoft delight thereon to reſt:

Her tender ſides, her belly white and cleere,

Which like an Altar did it ſelfe vpreare,

To offer ſacrifice deuine thereon:

Her goodly thighes, whoſe glory did appeare

Like a triumphall arch, and thereupon

The ſpoiles of Princes hangd, which were in battaile wone.

Idem.

— Her ſparkling eyes

Doe lighten forth ſweet loues alluring fire,

And in her treſſes ſhe doth fold the lookes

Of ſuch as gaze vpon her golden hayre.

Her baſhfull white, mixt with the mornings red,

Luna doth boaſt vpon her louely cheekes:

Her front is Beauties table, where ſhe paints

The glories of her gorgeous excellence:

Her teeth are ſhelues of precious Margarite,

Richly incloſd with ruddy Currall cleeues.

R. Greene.

My mistres is a paragon, the fayrest fayre aliue,

Alcides and Aeacides for faireleſſe faire did striue,

[[Page 409]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=212) Her
colour freſh as damaske roſe, her breath as violet,

Her body white as Iuory, as ſmooth as polliſht Iet,

As ſoft as down, & were ſhe downe, Ioue might com down & kiſſe

A loue ſo freſh, ſo ſweet, ſo white, ſo ſmooth, ſo ſoft as this.

W. Warner.

Then caſt ſhe off her roabe and ſtoode vpright,

As lightning breakes out of the labouring clowde,

Or as the morning heauen caſts off her night,

Or as that heauen caſt off it ſelfe, and ſhowde

Heauens vpper light, to which the brighteſt day

Is but a black and melancholy ſhrowde:

Or as when Venus ſtriu'd for ſoueraigne ſway

Of choiſefull beauty in young Troyes deſire,

So ſtoode Corinna varniſhing her tyre.

G. Chapman.

Herewith ſhe roſe, like the Autumnall ſtarre

Freſh burniſht in the lofty Ocean flood,

That darts his glorious influence more farre

Then any lampe of bright Olympus broode:

Shee lifts her lightning armes aboue her head

And ſtretcheth a Meridian, from her blood

That ſlept awakt in her Elizian bed:

Then knit ſhee vp, leaſt looſd, her glowing haire

Should ſcorch the centre, and incenſe the ayre.

Idem.

Sweete mouth that ſendſt a muskie-roſied breath

Fountaine of Nectar and delightfull balme,

Eyes clowdy-cleere, ſmile-frowning, ſtormie-calme,

Whoſe euery glaunce darts me a lyuing death:

Browes, bending quaintly, your round Eben arkes,

Smile, that then Ʋenus ſooner Mars beſets,

[[Page 410]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=213)Locks more
then golden, curld in curious knots,

vvhere in cloſe ambuſh wanton Cupid lurkes,

Grace Angel-like, faire forhead, ſmooth and hie,

Pure white that dimſt the Lillies of the vale,

Vermilion roſe that mak'ſt Aurora pale.

I. Siluester.

Such colour had her face as when the ſunne

Shines in a watry clowde in pleaſant ſpring;

And euen as when the Sommer is begunne

The Nightingales in boughes doe ſit and ſing,

So the blind God, whoſe force can no man ſhunne

Sits in her eyes, and thence his darts doth fling:

Bathing his wings in her bright chriſtal ſtreames,

And ſunning them in her rare beauties beames.

In theſe he heads his golden-headed dart,

In thoſe he cooleth it, and tempereth ſo,

He leuels thence at good Obertos hart,

And to the head he drawes it in his bow.

S. I. Harr.

— Olympias beauty was ſo rare

As well might moue a man the ſame to note:

Her hayre, her cheekes, her eyes, moſt amorous are,

Her noſe, her mouth, her ſhoulders, and her throat,

As for her other parts that then were bare,

Which ſhe was wont to couer with her coate,

Were made in ſuch a mould as might haue moued

The chaſt Hippolitus her to haue loued:

A man would thinke them framd by Phidias arts,

Theyr colour and proportion good was ſuch:

And vnto them her ſhamefaſtnes imparts

A greater grace to that before was much.

[[Page 411]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=213)I ceaſe to
praiſe thoſe other ſecret parts,

Nothing ſo fit to talke of as to touch:

In generall, all was as white as milk,

As ſmooth as Iuory, and as ſoft as ſilke.

Had ſhee in vally of Idea beene

vvhen Paſtor Paris hap did ſo befall

To be a Iudge three goddeſſes betweene,

She ſhould haue got, and they forgone the ball:

Had ſhe but once of him beene naked ſeene,

For Helena he had not card at all,

Nor broke the bonds of ſacred hoſpitalitie,

That bred his country wars and great mortalitie.

Had ſhe but then been in Crotona towne,

When Zeuxis for the Goddeſſe Iunos ſake

To paint a picture of moſt rare renowne

Did many of the fayreſt damſels make

To ſtand before him bare from foote to crowne,

A patterne of theyr perfect parts to take,

No doubt he would haue all the reſt refuſed,

And her alone in ſted of all haue chuſed.

S. I. Harr.

Faire is my loue for Aprill in her face,

Her louely breaſts September claimes his part,

And lordly Iuly in her eyes hath place,

But cold December dwelleth in her hart,

Bleſt be the months that ſets my hart on fire,

Accurſt that month that hindreth my deſire.

Like Phaebus fire, ſo ſparkles both her eyes,

As ayre perfum'd with Amber is her breath,

Like ſwelling waues her louely teates doe riſe,

As earth her hart cold, dateth me to death.

[[Page 412]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=214)In pompe
ſits mercy ſeated in her face,

Loue twixt her breaſts his trophies doth imprint,

Her eyes ſhines fauour, curteſie, and grace,

But touch her hart, oh that is made of flint.

R. Greene.

Her hayre not truſt, but ſcattered on her brow,

Surpaſſing Hyblaes honney for the view,

Or ſoftened golden wyers.

Within theſe ſnares firſt was my hart intrapped,

Till through thoſe golden ſhrouds mine eye did ſee

An Iuory ſhadowed front, wherein was wrapped

Thoſe prety bowers where graces couched be:

Next which, her cheekes appeard like Crimſon ſilke,

Or ruddy roſe beſpred in whiteſt milke.

Twixt which, the noſe in louely tenor bends

Two traces prety for a louers view:

Next which her lips like violets commends

By true proportion that which doth enſue;

Which when they ſmile, preſent vnto the eyes

The Oceans pride, and Iuory paradize.

Her polliſht necke of milke, where ſnows doe ſhine

As when the Moone in winter night beholds them,

Her breaſt of Alablaſter cleere and fine,

vvhereon two riſing apples fayre vnfold them,

Like Cynthias face when in her full ſhe ſhineth,

And bluſhing, to her loue-mates bower declineth.

From whence in length her armes doe ſweetly ſpread,

Like two rare branchie Saples in the ſpring,

Yeelding fiue louely ſprigs from euery head,

Proportioned alike in euery thing;

[[Page 413]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=214)which
featly ſprout in length like ſpring borne friends

vvhoſe prety tops, with fiue ſweet roſes ends.

But why alas ſhould I that marble hide

That doth adorne that one and other flanck,

From whence a mount of quickned ſnow doth glide,

Or elſe the vaile that bounds this milk-white banke,

vvhere Ʋenus and her ſiſters hide the fount,

vvhoſe louely Nectar doth all ſweetes ſurmount.

D. Lodge.

Whilſt thus ſhe meant vnſeene away to ſlide,

Her pearles and iewels cauſde her to be ſpide,

The muske and ciuet amber as ſhe paſt,

Long after her a ſweet perfume did caſt:

A Carbuncle on her chriſtall brow ſhe pight,

vvhoſe fierie gleames expeld the ſhady night:

Vpon her head a ſiluer criſpe ſhe pind,

Looſe wauing on her ſhoulders with the wind.

Gold band her golden hayre, her Iuory neck,

The Rubies rich, and Saphires blew did deck,

And at her eare, a pearle of greater valew

There hung, then that the Egyptian Queene did ſwal­low

And through her coller ſhowd her ſnowy breſt,

Her vtmoſt robe was colour blew celeſt,

Benetted all with twiſt of perfect gold,

Beſeeming well her comly corps t'enfold.

What els ſhe ware, might wel be ſeene vpon

That Queene who built the towers of Babylon.

Her wauering hayre diſparpling flew apart,

In ſeemely ſhed, the reſt with reckleſſe art,

vvith many a curling ring decord her face,

And gaue her ghaſtly browes a greater grace.

[[Page 414]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=215)Two
bending bowes of Eben coupled right,

Two lucent ſtarres that were of heauenly light,

Two ietty ſparks where Cupid chaſtly hides

His ſubtile ſhafts that from his quiuer glides:

Tweene thoſe two ſunnes and front of equall ſize,

A comly figure formally did riſe,

vvhich draught vnleuell to her lip deſcend,

vvhere Momus ſelfe could nothing diſcommend.

Her pittid cheekes appeard to bee depaint

vvith mixed roſe and lillies, ſweet and ſaint:

Her dulcet mouth with precious breath repleat,

Exceld the Saben Queene in ſauour ſweet:

Her corrall lips diſcouered as it were

Two ranks of orient pearles with ſmyling cheere:

Her Iuory necke, and breaſt of Alablaſter,

Made heathen men of her more Idolaſtre.

Vpon her hand no wrinckled knot was ſeene,

But as each nayle of Mother of pearle had beene:

In ſhort, this Iudith was ſo paſſing faire,

As if the learned Zeuxis had beene there

And ſeene this dame when he with penſill drew

The Croton dames, to forme the picture true

Of her for whom both Greece and Aſia fought,

This onely patterne chiefe he would haue ſought.

Tho. Hudſon.

Her words were like a ſtreame of honny fleeting,

The which doth ſoftly trickle from the hiue,

Able to melt the hearers hart vnweeting,

And eke to make the dead againe to liue:

Her deedes were like great cluſters of ripe grapes

Which loade the bunches of the fruitfull Vine,

[[Page 415]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=215)Offering
to fall into each mouth that gapes,

And fill the ſame with ſtore of timely wine.

Her breaſt two hills ore-ſpread with pureſt ſnow,

Sweet, ſmooth, and ſupple, ſoft and gently ſwelling

Betweene them lyes a milkie dale below,

vvhere loue, youth, gladnes, whitenes make their dwel­ling,

Her enuious veſture greedy ſight expelling:

So was the wanton clad, as if thus much

Should pleaſe the eye, the reſt vnſeene they touch:

As when the ſunne-beames diue through Tagus waue

To ſpy the ſtore-houſe of his ſpringing gold,

Loue perſing thought ſo through her mantle draue,

And in their gentle boſome wandred bold:

It viewd the wondrous beautie Virgins haue,

And all to finde deſire (with vantage) bold.

Alas what hope is left to quench this fire,

That kindled is by ſight, blowne by deſire.

D. Lodge.

Fayrer then was the Nymph of Mercurie,

Who when bright Phaebus mounteth vp his coach,

And tracks Aurora in her ſiluer ſteps,

And ſprinckling from the folding of her lap,

White Lillies, Roſes, and ſweet Violets.

R. Greene.

— Her Angels face

As the great eye of heauen ſhined bright,

And made a ſunſhine in the ſhady place,

Did neuer mortall eye behold ſuch heauenly grace.

Edm. Spencer.

[[Page 416]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=216)

Not that night-wandring pale and watry ſtarre,

(vvhen yawning dragons draw her thirſting carre

From Latmus mount vp to the gloomie skie,

vvhere crownd with blazing light and maieſtie

She proudly ſits) more ouer-rules the flood,

Then ſhe the harts of thoſe that neere her ſtood.

Could Loues rich bed-chamber her two bright eyes,

Beauty lyes alwayes there, did Mercy too

Phaebus were then Daphne ſhould be

Transformd into a ſtately dignitie.

Th. Dekkar.

Her ſtature comly tall, her gate well graced, and her wit,

To maruaile at, not medle with, as matchleſſe I omit:

A globe-like head, a gold-like haire, a forhead ſmooth & hie [...]

An euen noſe, on eyther ſide ſtoode out a grayiſh eye,

Two roſie cheeks, round ruddy lips, white iuſt ſet teeth within

A mouth in mean, & vnderdeath, a round & dimpled chin:

Her ſnowiſh neck with blewiſh vaines ſtood bolt vpright vpon

Her portly ſhoulders, beating balls her vained breſts anon

Ad more to beauty: wand-like was her middle, falling ſtill,

And riſing whereas women riſe, imagine nothing ill,

And more, her long & limber arms had white and azurd wriſt▪

And ſlender fingers anſwer to her ſmooth & lilly fists,

A leg in print, a prety foote, coniecture of the reſt,

For amorous eyes obſeruing forme, think parts obſcured beſt

W. Warner.

[[Page 417]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=216)

See where ſhe iſſues in her beauties pompe,

As Flora to ſalute the morning ſunne:

vvho when ſhe ſhakes her treſſes in the ayre,

Raines on the earth diſſolued pearle in ſhowres,

vvhich with his beames the ſunne exhales to heauen:

She holdes the ſpring and ſommer in her armes,

And euery plant puts on his freſheſt robes

To dannce attendance on her princely ſteps,

Springing and fading as ſhe comes and goes.

G. Chapman.

Her hayre was looſe, & bout her ſhoulders hung,

Vpon her browes did Ʋenus naked lye,

And in her eyes did all the Graces ſwim.

Her cheekes that ſhowd the temper of the mind,

Were beauties mornings where ſhe euer roſe,

Her lyps were loues rich altars where ſhe makes

Her hart a neuer-ceaſing ſacrifice:

Her teeth ſtoode like a ranke of Dians maydes

vvhen naked in a ſecrete bower they bathe;

Her long round necke was Cupids quiuer calld,

And her ſweet words that flew from her, his ſhafts,

Her ſoft round breſts were his ſole trauaild Alpes,

vvhere ſnow that thawed with ſunne did euer lye,

Her fingers bounds to her rich deitie.

Idem.

[...]n Paradiſe of late a Dame begun

To peepe out of her bed with ſuch a grace,

As matcht the riſing of the morning ſunne,

[...]vith drops of honney falling from her face,

Brighter then Phaebus fierie-pointed beames,

Or ycie cruſt of chriſtall frozen ſtreames.

[[Page 418]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=217)Her hayre
like Amber twiſted vp in gold,

Paſſing the pride or riches of the Eaſt,

With curious knots were into trammels rould,

As ſnary nettings for a wandring gueſt;

The feathers deckt her with a quaint diſdaine

Like Iunos byrd in pompe of ſpotted traine.

Her ſhining forhead doth ſuppreſſe the ſtarres,

New lightning ſparkles from her louely cheekes,

Her percing ſight the ſtroake of beauties warres,

Wherewith the conqueſt of the world ſhe ſeekes:

Braue be the darts that from her eyes ſhe throwes,

When Cupid lurkes betweene her louely browes,

Arabian odours breathe out of her talke,

Which ſhe betweene the pearle and Ruby breaketh,

So ſmooth a compaſſe hath her tongue to walke,

As makes both heauen & earth bluſh whē ſhe ſpeaketh

No ſinging bird in all the ayre but doates,

And lay theyr eares attentiue to her notes.

Her necke, her ſhoulders, and her breaſts were bare,

Diana-like aboue the water ſmiling:

No ſnow, Iuory, or Alablaſter there,

No ſtatue of white Marble, me beguiling,

But the ſweet ſeaſon of the yeere I found

When Lillies peepe out of the graſſie ground.

Her other parts vnto my view denide,

Much like the lampe that burnt at Pſyches bed,

Made ſuch a fire into my hart to glide

That loue awaked, and my body bled:

O had ſhe not ſo great a force to pleaſe,

Deſire had ſlept, and I had liu'd at eaſe.

S. G.

Aſtronomers the heauens doe deuide

Into eyght houſes, where the Gods remaine,

All which in thy perfections doe abide,

For in thy feete the Queene of ſilence raignes,

About thy waſt Ioues meſſenger doth dwell,

Inchaunting me, as I thereat admire,

And on thy duggs the Queene of loue doth tell

Her godheads power in ſcroules of my deſire:

Thy beautie is the worlds eternall ſunne,

Thy fauours force a cowards hart to darres,

And in thy hayres, Ioue and his riches wonne,

Thy frownes hold Saturne, thine eyes the fixed ſtarres.

H. C.

What length of verſe braue Mopſus good to ſhow?

[...]hoſe vertues ſtrange, & beauties ſuch, as no man may them know.

Thus ſhrewdly burdned thē, how can my Muſe eſcape?

Like great god Saturne faire, & like faire Venus chaſt,

As ſmooth as Pan as Iuno mild, like goddeſſe Iris gracſt,

With Cupid ſhe foreſees, and goes Gods Vulcans pace,

And for a taſt of all theſe gifts, ſhe ſteales god Momus grace

Her forhead Iacinth like, her cheekes of opall hue,

Her twinckling eyes bedeckt with pearle, her lyps as Saphires blew,

Her haire like crapal ſtone, her mouth ô heauenly wide,

Her skin like burniſht gold, her hands like ſiluer-ore vntride:

As for her parts vnknowne, which hidden ſure are beſt,

Happy be they which wil beleeue, and neuer ſeeke the reſt.

S. Phil. Sidney.

O words which fall like Sommer dew on me,

O breath more ſweet then is the growing beane,

O tongue in which all honnied licours be,

[[Page 420]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=218)O voyce
that doth the Thruſh in ſhrilnes ſtaine,

Gay haire, more gay then ſtraw when harueſt lies,

Lips red and plum, as cherries ruddy ſide,

Eyes fayre and great, like fayre great Oxes eyes,

O breaſts in which two white ſheepe ſwell in pride.

But thou white skin, as white as curds well preſt,

So ſmooth as Sleeke-ſtone like, it ſmooths each part,

And thou deere fleſh, as ſoft as wooll new dreſt,

And yet as hard as Brawne made hard by art.

S. Phil. Sidney.

### 1.267. Poeticall compariſons. Beautie.

As that fayre ſtarre the meſſenger of morne

His dewy face out of the ſea doth reare,

Or as the Ciprian Goddeſſe newly borne

Of the Oceans fruitfull froth did firſt appeare,

Such ſeemed they, and ſo theyr yellow haire,

Chriſtalline humour dropped downe apace.

Edm. Spencer.

As when faire Cinthia in a darkſome night

Is in a noyous clowde enuoloped,

Breakes forth her ſiluer beames, and her bright head

Diſcouers to the world diſcomfited:

Of the poore trauailer that went aſtray,

Such was the beauty and the ſhining ray

With which fayre Britomart gaue light vnto the day.

Idem.

Looke how the crowne which Ariadne wore

Vpon her Iuory forhead that ſame day

That Theſeus her vnto his bridall bore,

vvhen the bold Centaures made that bloody fray

vvith the fierce Lapiths that did them diſmay,

Beeing now placed in the firmament,

Through the bright heauen doth her beames diſplay,

And is vnto the ſtarres an ornament

vvhich round about her moue in order excellent,

Such was the beauty of this goodly band.

Euen as a ſtage ſet forth with pompe and pride,

Where men doe cunning and theyr arte beſtow,

vvhen that is gone, doth cleerer ſeeme to grow:

So Bradamant when as her head was bareſt,

Her colour and her bea [...]e ſeemed rareſt.

S. I. Harr. tranſl.

As when fayre Ver dight in her flowrie raile,

In her new coloured liuerie decks the earth,

And glorious Titan ſpreds his ſun-ſhine vaile

To bring to paſſe her tender infants birth:

Such was her beauty which I then poſſeſt,

With whoſe imbracings all my youth was bleſt.

M. Drayton.

Looke how a Comet at the firſt appearing

vvretched Ixions ſhaggy-footed race

Incenſt with ſauage heate gallop a maine

From ſteeppine-bearing mountaines to the plaine,

So ran the people forth to gaze vpon her,

And all that viewd her, were inamourd on her.

C. Marlow.

Like as an horſe when he is barded haile,

And feathered pannache ſet vpon his head,

Will make him ſeeme more braue for to aſſaile

The enemie, he that the troope dois lead,

And pannach on his helme will ſet indeid:

Euen ſo had nature to decore her face,

Giuen her one top for to augment her grace.

Rex. Sco.

Like as a Taper burning in the darke,

(As if it threatned euery watchfull eye

That burning viewes it) makes that eye his marke,

And hurles guild darts at it continually:

Or as it enuyed any eye but it

Should ſee in darknes: ſo my miſtres beautie,

From forth her ſecret ſtand my hart doth hit,

And like the dart of Cephalus doth kill

Her perfect louer, though ſhe meane no ill.

G. Chapman.

Now as when heauen is mufled with the vapours,

His long ſince iuſt diuorced wife the earth

In enuy breaths, to maske his ſpurry tapers

When ſtraight the Weſterne iſſue of the ayre

Beats with his floury wings thoſe brats of dearth,

And giues Olympus leaue to ſhow his fayre,

And ſhewd her pleaſant countenaunce ful as cleere.

And where ſhe ends, ſhe doth anew begin.

W. Shakespeare.

— Looke how cloſe the Iuy doth embrace

The tree or branch about the which it growes,

So cloſe the louers couched in that place,

Each drawing in the breath the other blowes:

But how great ioyes they found that little ſpace,

Well we may geſſe, but none for certaine knowes,

Such was theyr ſport, ſo well theyr leere they couth,

That oft they had two tongues within one mouth.

S. I. Harr.

Like as the wanton Iuie with his twine,

When as the Oake his rootleſſe body warmes,

Preſaging ioy the one imbrace the other:

Thus one the other in our armes we fold,

Our breaſts for ioy our harts could ſcarcely hold.

Of this worlds centre, both his birds ioynd breſt

In Cynthian Delphos, ſince Earths nauill height:

Like as a well-tunde Lute that's tucht with skill

In muſicks language ſweetly ſpeaking plaine,

When euery ſtring it ſelfe with ſound doth fill,

Taking theyr times, and giuing them againe,

So theyr affections ſet in keyes ſo like,

Still fall in conſort as theyr humors ſtrike.

Backe to the ſtraite that forced him ſo faſt,

In rage ſent out, recald in rage being paſt:

Euen ſo his ſighes, his ſorrowes make a ſaw,

To puſh greefe on, and back the ſame greefe draw.

W. Shakespeare.

— The ſtorme ſo rumbled in her breaſt

As Eolus could neuer roare the like,

And ſhowres downe rained from her eyes ſo faſt

That all bedrent the place, till at the laſt

Well eaſed they the dolour of the minde,

As rage of raine doth ſwage the ſtormie wind.

M. Sackuile.

As in September when our yeere reſignes

The little bird yet to ſalute the morne

Vpon the naked branches ſets her foote,

The leaues now lying on the moſſie roote:

And there a ſilly chiriping doth keepe,

As though ſhe faine would ſing, yet faine would weepe,

Prayſing faire Sommer that too ſoone is gone,

Or mourning winter, too faſt comming on,

In this ſad plight I mourne for thy returne.

M. Drayton.

As when the fatall bird of augurie

Seeing a ſtormie diſmall clowde ariſe

vvithin the South, foretells with pittious cry

The weeping tempeſt that on ſuddaine hies,

The licour bides behind with too much haſt,

And with the ſtriuing oft is in ſuch taking,

As ſcant a man may yet it out with ſhaking.

As one that ſaw in Aprill or in May

A pleaſant garden full of fragrant flowers,

Then when the earth new clad in garments gay

Decks euery wood and groue with pleaſant bowers,

Comming againe on ſome Decembers day,

And ſees it mard with winters ſtormes and ſhowers,

So did the Court to Bradamant appeare,

When as ſhe ſaw Rogero was not there.

I. Harr.

As gorgious Phaebus in his firſt vpriſe,

Diſcouering now his ſcarlet-coloured head,

By troublous motions of the lowring skies,

His glorious beames with fogs are ouer-ſpred

So are his cheerfull browes ecclipſt with ſorrow,

which clowd the ſhine of his youths ſmiling morrow

M. Drayton.

Like as when Phaebus darting forth his rayes,

Glydeth along the ſwelling Ocean ſtreames,

And whilſt one billow with another playes

Reflecteth backe his bright tranſlucent beames:

Such was the conflict then betwixt our eyes▪

Sending forth lookes as teares do fall and riſe.

Idem.

Like to a veſſell with a narrow vent,

Which is fild vp with licour to the top,

Although the mouth be after downeward bent,

Yet is it ſeene not to diſtill a drop;

Euen thus our breaſt brimful with penſiue care,

Stopping our tongues, with greefe we ſilent are.

Idem.

As the high Elme (when his deare Vine hath twind

Faſt in her hundred armes and holds imbraſt)

Beares downe to earth his ſpouſe and darling kind

If ſtorme or cruell ſteele the tree downe caſt,

And her full grapes to nought doth bruze and grind,

Spoyles his own leaues, faints, withers, dies at laſt,

And ſeemes to mourne and die, not for his owne,

But for the death of her that lyes orethrowne:

So fell he mourning▪ mourning for the dame

Whom life and death had made for euer his.

E. Fairefax.

As when a foggy miſt hath ouer-caſt

The face of heauen, and the cleere ayre ingroſt,

The world in darknes dwells, till that at laſt

The watry South-wind from the Sea-bord coaſt

Vp blowing doth diſperſe the vapours loſt,

And powres it ſelfe forth in a ſtormie ſhowre:

[[Page 428]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=222)So the
fayre Britomart hauing diſcloſt

Her cloudy care into a wrathfull ſtowre,

The midſt of greefe diſsolued into vengeance powre.

Edm. Spen.

— As a ſtroke giuen on the righter eye

Offends the left, euen ſo by ſimpathy

Her husbands dolours made her hart vnglad,

And Iudiths ſorrowes made her husband ſad.

### 1.271. Diſsimulation.

As when a wearie trauailer that ſtraies

By muddy ſhore of broad ſeauen-mouthed Nile,

Vnwitting of the perilous wandring wayes

Doth meete a cruell craftie Crocodile,

vvhich in falſe greefe hiding his harmefull guile,

Doth weepe full ſore, and ſheddeth tender teares:

The fooliſh man that pitties all the while

His mournfull plight, is ſwallowed vp vnwares,

Forgetfull of his owne that minds anothers cares:

So wept Dueſſa vntill euentide.

Edm. Spencer.

As cunning ſingers ere they ſtraine on hie

In loude melodious tunes theyr gentle voyce,

Prepare the hearers eares to harmonie

With fainings ſweet, low notes, and warbles choyce:

So ſhe, not hauing yet forgot pardie

Her wonted ſhifts and ſleights in Cupids toyes,

A ſequence firſt of ſighes and ſobs forth caſt,

To breede compaſſion deere, then ſpake at laſt.

As when two ſunnes appeare in th'azure skie,

Mounted in Phaebus Chariot fierie bright,

Both darting forth faire beames to each mans eye,

And both adornd with lamps of flaming light:

All that behold ſo ſtrange prodigious ſight,

Nor natures work them geſſe, nor what to weene,

Are rapt with wonder, and with rare affright,

So ſtoode Sir Marinell when he had ſeene

The ſemblance of this falſe by this faire beauties queene.

Idem.

### 1.272. Loue.

As men tormented with a burning feauer

Dreame that with drinke they ſwage their greeuous thirſt,

But when they wake they feele theyr thirſt perſeuer,

And to be greater then it was at firſt:

So ſhee whoſe thoughts frō loue ſleepe could not ſeuer,

Dreamt of that thing for which ſhe wake did thirſt:

But waking, felt and found it as before,

Her hope ſtill leſſe, and her deſire ſtill more.

S. I. Harr.

[[Page 430]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=223)

The man that dwells farre North hath ſildome harme

With blaſt of winters winde or nypping froſt:

The Negro ſildome feeles himſelfe too warme,

If he abide within his natiue coaſt:

So loue in mee a ſecond nature is,

And cuſtome makes me thinke my woes are bliſſe.

Tho. Watſon.

The Harpie byrds that did in ſuch deſpight

Greeue and annoy old Phineus ſo ſore,

Were chaſde away by Calais in fight,

And by his brother Zeth for euermore:

vvho followed vntill they heard on hie,

A voyce that ſaid; ye twins no farther flie.

Phineus I am that ſo tormented was,

My Laura heere I may a Harpie name,

My thoughts and luſts be ſonnes to Boreas,

Which neuer ceaſt in following my dame,

Till heauenly grace ſayd vnto me at laſt,

Leaue fond delights, and ſay thy loue is paſt.

Idem.

All as the greedy fiſher layes his hookes

Alongſt the coaſt to catch ſome mighty fiſh,

More for his gaine, then wholſome for the diſh

Of him that buies: euen ſo theſe ſiſters braue,

Haue louers more then honeſt maydens haue▪

Tho. Hudſon.

— As when mightie Macedon had wonne

The Monarchie of earth, yet when he fainted,

Greeu'd that no greater action could be done,

And that there no more worlds was to ſubdue,

So loues defects, loues conquerour did rue.

Edm. Spencer.

[[Page 431]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=223)

Looke as the faire and fiery-poynted ſunne

Ruſhing from forth a clowde bereaues our ſight,

Euen ſo the curtaine drawne, his eyes begun

To winke, beeing blinded with a greater light.

W. Shakespeare.

Like as in furie of a dreadfull fight,

Theyr fellowes being ſlaine, or put to flight,

Poore ſouldiours ſtand with feare of death dead ſtroo­ken,

So at her preſence all ſurprizd and tooken,

Await the ſentence of her ſcornefull eyes;

He whom ſhe fauours liues, the other dies.

C. Marlow.

### 1.273. Feare.

Like as a Hinde forth ſingled from the heard

That hath eſcaped from a rauenous beaſt,

Yet flies away, of her owne feete afrayd,

And euery leafe that ſhaketh with the leaſt

Murmure of windes, her terror hath increaſt,

So fled fayre Florimell from her vaine feare.

Edm. Spencer.

— He ſhakes aloft his Romaine blade,

Which like a Faulchon towring in the skies

Coucheth the foule below with his wings ſhade,

Whoſe crooked beake threats, if he mount, he dies:

So vnder his inſulting Fauchion lyes

Harmeleſſe Lucretia, marking what he tells,

With trembling feare, as foule heares Faulchons bells.

W. Shakespeare.

As the poore frighted Deere that ſtands at gaze,

Wildly determining which way to flie,

[[Page 432]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=224)Or one
incompaſt with a winding maze,

That cannot tread the way out readily,

So with her ſelfe ſhe growes in mutinie

To liue or die which of the twaine were better,

When life is ſham'd, and deaths reproches better.

Idem.

Like as the Snayle, whoſe hornes being once hit,

Shrinks backward in his ſhelly caue with paine,

And there all ſmoothred vp in ſhade doth ſit,

Long after fearing to creepe forth againe:

So at his bloody view her eyes are fled

Into the deepe darke cabbins of her head.

Idem.

As in the night each little fierie ſparke

May plainly be diſcerned with our eyne,

But when the day doth come we then ſhall marke

That all are dampt and doe no longer ſhine:

So kindles feare in minde which doubt made darke,

Vntill my ſunne in my Horizon ſhine.

S. I. Harr.

So great a terror in theyr minde was bred

That ſtraight as if with ſprites they had beene skard,

This way and that, confuſedly they fled,

And left the gates without defence or gard:

As tumults often are at ſtage plaies bred,

When falſe reports of ſudden fits are heard:

Or when the ouer-loaden ſeates doe cracke,

One tumbling downe vpon anothers back.

Idem.

Like as in time of Spring the water's warme,

And crowding frogs like fiſhes there doe ſwarme,

[[Page 433]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=224)But with
the ſmalleſt ſtone that you can caſt

To ſtirre the ſtreame, theyr crowding ſtaies as faſt:

So while Iudea was in ioyfull dayes,

The conſtancie of them was worthy praiſe,

For that in euery purpoſe ye ſhould heare

The praiſe of God reſounding euery where:

So that like burning candles they did ſhine,

Among theyr faithfull flock, like men diuine,

But looke how ſoone they heard of Holoferne,

Theyr courage quaild, and they began to derne.

T. Hudſon.

### 1.274. Of Flight.

Looke how a purple flower doth fade and die

That painefull ploughman cutteth vp with ſhare,

Or as the Poppies head aſide doth lye

When it the body can no longer beare:

So did the noble Dardanello die,

And with his death fild all his men with feare:

As waters runne abroade that breake theyr bay

So fled his ſouldiours, breaking theyr aray.

S. I. Harr.

As the ſwift Vre by Ʋolgaes rolling flood

Chaſde through the plaine the maſtife curres to-forne,

Flies to the ſuccour of ſome neighbour wood,

And often turnes againe his dreadfull horne

Againſt the dogs, imbrude in ſweat and blood

That bite not till the beaſt to flight returne:

Or as the Moores at theyr ſtrange tennis runne

Defenſt, the flying balls vnhurt to ſhunne,

So ranne Clorinda, ſo her foes purſude.

Ed. Fairefax.

[[Page 434]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=225)

Like as a Lyon whoſe imperiall power

A proude rebellious Vnicorne defies,

To auoyd the raſh aſſault and wrathfull ſtowre

Of his fierce foe, him for a tree applies,

And when in running in full courſe he ſpies,

He ſlips aſide, the whilſt that furious beaſt

His precious horne ſought of his enemies

Strikes in the ſtock, ne thence can be releaſt,

But to the mighty victor yeelds a bounteous feaſt,

With ſuch fayre flight him Guion often foyld.

Edm. Spencer.

### 1.275. Errour.

As when old father Nilus gins to ſwell

With timely pride aboue th'Egyptian vale,

His fatty waues doe fertile ſhine out well,

And ouer-flow each plaine, and lowly dale,

But when his later ebbe gins to auaile,

Huge heapes of mud he leaues, wherein there breed

Ten thouſand kinde of creatures, partly male,

And partly female, of his fruitfull ſeede,

Such vgly monſtrous ſhapes elſwhere may no man re [...]

Ed. Spen. compard to Errors vomit.

### 1.276. Of Rage.

As ſauage Bull whom two fierce maſtiues bait,

When rancor doth with rage him once ingore,

Forgets with warie ward them to await

But with his dreadfull hornes them driues afore,

Or flings aloft, or treads downe in the floore,

Breathing out wrath, and bellowing diſdaine,

That all the forreſt quakes to heare him rore,

[[Page 435]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=225)So ragde
Prince Arthur twixt his foe-men twaine,

That neither could his mighty puiſſance ſuſtaine.

Edm Spen.

Looke what a noyſe an heard of ſauage ſwine

Doe make, when as the Wolfe a pig doth take

That doth in all theyr hearings cry and whine,

Flocking about as nature hath them taught:

So doe theſe ſouldiours murmure and repine

To ſee theyr Captaine thus to miſchiefe brought:

And with great fury they doe ſet vpon him,

All with one voyce, ſtill crying on him, on him.

I. Harr.

As when within the ſoft and ſpungie ſoyle

The winde doth pierce the intrailes of the earth,

Where hurly bu [...]ly with a reſtleſſe coyle,

Shakes all the centre, wanting iſſue forth,

Tell with the tumour townes & mountaines tremble,

Euen ſuch a meteor doth theyr rage reſemble.

M. Drayton.

As when a Comet farre and wide deſcride

In ſcorne of Phaebus midſt bright heauen doth ſhine,

And tydings ſad of death and miſchiefe brings,

So ſhond the Pagan in bright armour clad,

And rold his eyes.

Ed. Fairefax.

Like as a Bull when prickt with iealouſie,

He ſpies the riuall of his hote deſire,

Through all the fields doth bellow, rore, and cry,

And with his thundring voyce augments his ire:

And threatning battaile to the emptie skie,

Teares with his horne each plant, each buſh, each brier,

[[Page 436]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=226)And with
his foote caſt's vp his hand on hight,

Defying his ſtrong foe to deadly fight,

Such was the Pagans fury, ſuch his cry.

Idem.

Like as a Goſhauke that in foote doth beare

A trembling Culuer, hauing ſpyde on hight

An Eagle that with plumy wings doth ſheare

The ſubtile ayre, ſtooping with all his might

The quarry throwes to ground with fell deſpight,

And to the battaile doth herſelfe prepare:

So ranne the Gianteſſe vnto the fight;

Her fiery eyes with furious ſparks did ſtare,

And with blaſphemous bans, high God in peeces tar [...]

Edm. Spencer.

As Lyons meete, or Bulls in paſtures greene

With teeth and hornes, and ſtaine with blood the field,

Such eager fight theſe warriours was betweene,

And eythers ſpeare had peirſt the others ſhield.

I. Harr.

Like as with equall rage, and equall might

Two aduerſe windes combate with billowes proud,

And neyther yeeld, ſeas, skies maintaine like fight,

Waue againſt waue oppoſd, and clowde to clowde,

So warre both ſides with obſtinate deſpight,

With like reuenge, and neither partie bowd,

Fronting each other with confounding blowes,

No wound one ſword vnto the other owes.

Sam. Daniell.

With equall rage as when the Southerne-winde

Meeteth in battaile through the Northerne blaſt,

The ſea and ayre to weather is reſignde

[[Page 437]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=226)But clowd
gainſt clowd, & waue gainſt waue they paſt:

So from this skirmiſh neither part declind,

But fought it out, and keepes theyr footings faſt,

And oft with furious ſhock together ruſh,

And ſhield gainſt ſhield, & helme gainſt helme they cruſh.

Ed. Fairefax. tranſl.

Such was theyr furie as when Boreas teares

The ſhattered crags from Taurus Northerne clift,

Vpon theyr helmes theyr Launces long they broke,

And vp to heauen flew ſplinters, ſparks, & ſmoake.

Idem.

As when two Tygers prickt with hungers rage

Haue by good fortune found ſome beaſts freſh ſpoile,

On which they weene theyr famine to aſſwage,

And gaine a feaſtfull guerdon of theyr toyle,

Both falling out, doe ſtirre vp ſtrifefull broyle,

And cruell battaile twixt themſelues doe make,

Whilſt neither lets the other touch the ſoile

But eyther ſdeignes with other to pertake,

So cruelly thoſe Knights ſtroue for that Ladies ſake.

Edm. Spencer.

From out his fearefull eyes two fierie beames

More ſharpe then poynts of needles did proceed,

Shooting forth farre away two flaming ſtreames

Full of ſad power that poyſonous baite did breed

To all that within lookt without good heede,

And ſecretly his enemies did ſlay:

Like as the Baſiliske of Serpents ſeede

From painfull eyes cloſe venome doth conuay

Into the lookers hart, and killeth farre away.

Idem.

[[Page 438]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=227)

As when a Dolphin and a Sele are met

In the wide champion of the Ocean plaine,

With cruell chafe theyr courages they whet,

The maiſterdome of each by force to gaine,

And dreadfull battaile twixt them doe darraine:

They ſnuffe, they ſnort, they bounce, they rage, they rore

That all the Sea diſturbed with theyr traine

Doth frie with foame aboue the ſurges hore,

Such was betwixt theſe two the troubleſome vprore.

Ed. Spencer.

As when the fierie mounted ſteedes which drew

The ſunnes bright waine, to Phactons decay,

Soone as they did the monſtrous Scorpions view

With vgly crapples crawling in theyr way,

The ſight thereof did them ſo ſore affray,

That their well knowne courſes they forewent:

And leading the euer-burning lampe aſtray,

This lower world nigh all to aſhes brent,

And left their ſcorched path yet in the firmament:

Such was the furie of theſe head-ſtrong ſteedes,

Soone as the infants ſunlike ſhield they ſaw.

Idem.

Like as the curſed ſonne of Theſeus,

That following his chace in dewie morne,

To flie his ſtepdames loue outragious,

Of his owne ſteedes was all to peeces torne,

And his faire limbs left in the woods forlorne,

That for his ſake Diana did lament,

And all the woodie Nimphs did waile and mourne:

So was the Soldane rapt and all to rent,

That of his ſhape appeard no little moniment.

Idem.

[[Page 439]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=227)

Like raging Iuno, when with knife in hand

Shee threw her husbands murthered infant out,

Or fell Medea when on Colchicke ſtrand

Her brothers bones ſhe ſcattered round about,

Or as that madding mother mongſt the rout

Of Bacchus prieſts, her owne deere fleſh did teare:

Yet neyther Iuno nor Medea ſtout,

Nor all the Menades ſo furious were,

As this bold woman when ſhe ſaw the damſell there.

Idem.

As the heate hidden in a watry clowde,

Striuing for iſſue with ſtrange murmures loud,

Like gunnes aſtuns, with round-round-rumbling thun­der,

Filling the ayre with noyſe, the earth with wonder,

So the three ſiſters, the three hidious rages,

Raiſe thouſand ſtormes, leauing th'infernall ſtages.

I. Silueſter.

### 1.277. Pittie. Curteſie.

Shee pittious nurſe applyde her painfull thought

To ſerue and nouriſh them that her vp-brought;

Like to the gratefull Storke, that gathereth meate,

And brings it to her elders for to eate.

And on a Firre-tree high, with Boreas blowne

Giues life to thoſe of whom ſhe had her owne.

Th. Hudſon.

As the bright ſunne what time his fierie teame

Toward the Weſterne brim begins to draw,

Gins to abate the brightnes of his beame,

And feruor of his flames ſomewhat adaw,

So did this mighty Lady when ſhe ſaw

[[Page 440]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=228)Thoſe two
ſtrange Knights ſuch homage to her make,

Bate ſomewhat of her maieſtie and awe

That whilom wont to doe ſo many quake,

And with more milde aſpect thoſe two to entertake.

Edm. Spen.

As when the Southerne winde with luke-warme blaſt

Breathing on hills where winter long had dwelt

Diſſolues the rocks of Ice that hung ſo faſt,

And all the new made mounts of ſnow doth melt:

So with this gentle prayer, though ſpoke in haſt,

The damſell ſuch an inward motion felt

That ſuddainly her armed hart did ſoften,

As vnto women-kinde it chaunceth often.

S. I. Harr.

Like as the winde ſtopt by ſome wood or hill

Growes ſtrong & fierce, teares bowes & trees in twaine,

But with mild blaſts more temperate gentle ſtill

Againſt the rocks as ſea-waues murmure ſhrill

But ſilent paſſe amid the open maine:

Rinaldo ſo when none his force with-ſtood,

Aſſwagde his furie, calmd his angry moode.

Idem.

### 1.278. Courage.

As when two Rammes ſtird with ambitious pride

Fight for the rule of the rich-fleeced flock,

Theyr horned fronts ſo fierce on eyther ſide

Doe meete, that with the terror of the ſhock

Aſtonied, both ſtand ſenceleſſe as a block

Forgetfull of the hanging victorie:

So ſtoode theſe twaine vnmoued as a rock,

[[Page 441]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=228)Both
ſtaring fierce, and holding ielely

The broken reliques of their former crueltie.

Edm. Spencer.

Aboue the waues as Neptune lift his eyes

To chyde the windes that Troyan ſhips oppreſt,

And with his countenaunce calmd ſeas, winds & skies,

So lookt Rinaldo when he ſhooke his creſt.

S. I. Harr.

When the ayre is calme and ſtill, as dead and deafe,

And vnder heauen quakes not an Aſpen leafe,

When ſeas are calme, and thouſand veſſels fleet

Vpon the ſleeping ſeas with paſſage ſweet,

And when the variant wind is ſtill and lowne

The cunning Pilot neuer can be knowne;

But when the cruell ſtorme doth threat the barke

To drowne in deeps of pits infernall darke,

While toſſing teares both ruther, maſt and ſaile,

While mounting, ſeemes the azure skies to ſcale,

While driues perforce vpon ſome deadly ſhore,

There is the Pilot knowne, and not before.

Th. Hudſon.

As a tall ſhippe toſſed in troubled ſeas,

Whom raging windes threatning to make theyr pray

Of the rough rocks doe diuerſly diſeaſe

Meets two contrary billowes by the way

That her on eyther ſide doth ſore aſſay,

And boaſt to ſwallow her in greedy graue;

Shee ſcorning both their ſpights, doth make wide way,

And with her breaſt breaking the foamie waue,

Doth ride on both their backs, and faire herſelfe doth ſaue,

So boldly he him beares.

Ed. Spen.

[[Page 442]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=229)

As when a ſhyp that flies farre vnder ſayle

A hidden rocke eſcaped hath vnwares,

That lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile,

The Mariner yet halfe amazed ſtares

At perrill paſt, and yet in doubt, ne dares

To ioy at his foole-hardie ouer-ſight:

So doubly is diſtreſt twixt ioy and feares

The dreadleſſe courage of this Elſin Knight.

Edm. Spen.

### 1.279. Maiestie. Pompe.

Looke as great Cinthia in her ſiluer Carre

Rides in her progreſſe round about her ſphere,

Whoſe tendance is the faire eye-dazeling ſtarres

Trooping about her Chariot, that with cleere

And glorious ſhowes makes euery eye delight

To gaze vpon the beautie of the night,

Clad and attended with the worlds delight,

So is the Queene in maieſtie brought forth.

Chr. Middleton.

Like trident-maced Neptune in his pride,

Mounted vpon a Dolphin in a ſtorme,

Vpon the toſſing billowes forth doth ride,

About whoſe traine a thouſand Tritons ſwarme:

When Phaebus ſeemes to ſet the waues on fire,

To ſhew his glory, and the Gods deſire:

Or like vnto the fiery-faced ſunne,

Vpon his wagon prauncing in the Weſt,

Whoſe bluſhing cheekes with flames ſeeme ouer-runne

Whilſt ſweating thus he gallops to his reſt:

Such was the glory wherein now I ſtood,

[[Page 443]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=229)Which
makes the Barons ſweat theyr deereſt blood.

M. Drayton.

As ſtately Thames inricht with many a flood

And goodly riuers that haue made their graues

And buried both theyr names and all theyr good

vvithin his greatnes to augment his waues,

Glides on with pompe of waters vnwithſtood

Vnto the Ocean, which his tribute craues,

And layes vp all his wealth within that powre,

vvhich in it ſelfe all greatnes doth deuoure:

So flockt the mightie with theyr following traine

Vnto the all-receauing Bullenbrooke.

S. Daniell.

Then thou on thine imperiall Chariot ſet

Crownd with a rich imperled Coronet,

Whilſt the Pariſian dames as thy traine paſt

Theyr precious incenſe in aboundance caſt:

As Cynthia from the waue-embateled ſhrowdes

Opening the weſt, comes ſtreming through the clowds,

With ſhining troopes of ſiluer-treſled ſtarres

Attending on her as her Torch-bearers,

And all the leſſer lights about her throne,

With admiration ſtand as lookers on,

Whilſt ſhe alone in height of all her pride

The Queene of light along her ſpheare doth glide.

M. Drayton.

### 1.280. Ciuill warres.

Euen like to Rheine which in his birth oppreſt

Strangled almoſt with rocks and mighty hills,

Workes out away to come to better reſt,

[[Page 444]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=230)Warres
with the Mountaines, ſtriues againſt their wills,

Brings forth his ſtreames in vnitie profeſt

Into the quiet bed he proudly fills,

Carrying the greatnes which he cannot keepe,

Vnto his death and buriall in the deepe:

So did the worlds proude Miſtres Rome at firſt

Striue with an hard beginning, ward with neede,

Forcing her ſtrong confiners to the worſt,

And in her blood her greatnes firſt did breede:

So Spaine at home with Moores ere forth it burſt,

Did practiſe long, and in it ſelfe did bleed:

So did our ſtate begin with her owne wounds

To try her ſtrength, ere it enlargd her bounds.

Sam. Daniell.

Like as an exhalation hote and dry

Amongſt the ayre-bred moiſtie vapours throwne

Spetteth his lightning forth couragiouſly,

Renting the thicke clowdes with a thunder-ſtone,

As though the huge all-couering heauen did grone,

Such is the garboyle of this conflict then,

Braue Engliſhmen encountring Engliſhmen.

M. Drayton.

Like as a clowde foule, darke and vgly black,

Threatning the earth with tempeſt euery howre,

Now broken with a fearefull thunder-crack,

Straight powreth downe his deepe earth-drenching ſhowre,

Thus for theyr wrongs now riſe they vp in armes,

Or to reuenge, or to amend theyr harmes.

Idem.

[[Page 445]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=230)

### 1.281. Death.

Then downe he tumbled like an aged tree,

High growing on the top of rockie clift,

Whoſe hart-ſtrings with keene ſteele nigh hewen be,

The mighty trunck halfe rent with ragged rift,

Doth rolle adowne the rocks, & falls with fearfull drift.

Edm. Spencer.

Or as a Caſtle reared high and round,

By ſubtile engins and malicious ſlight

Is vndermined from the loweſt ground,

And her foundations forſt and feebled quite,

At laſt downe falls, and with her heaped hight

Her haſtie ruine doth more heauie make,

And yeelds it ſelfe vnto the victors might,

Such was this Giants fall.

Idem.

As when two billowes in the Iriſh ſounds

Forcibly driuen with contrary tydes

Doe meete together, each aback rebounds

With roring rage, and daſhing on all ſides

That filleth all the ſea with foame, deuides

The doubtfull current into diuers waues,

So fell theſe two in ſpight of both theyr prides.

Idem.

### 1.282. Hope.

Like as through Tagus faire tranſparent ſtreames

The wandring Marchant ſees the ſandy gold,

Or like as Cynthias halfe obſcured beames

In ſilent night the Pilot doth behold

Through miſtie clowdes, and vapours manifold,

So through a mirror of my hop'd for gaine,

[[Page 446]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=231)I ſaw the
treaſure which I ſhould obtaine.

[...]h. Storer.

Like as the ſunne at one ſelfe time is felt

With heate to harden clay, and waxe doth melt,

So Amrams ſacred ſonne in theſe proiects,

Made one ſelfe cauſe haue two contrary effects;

For Iſaack humbly knew theyr Lord diuine,

But Pharo more and more did ſtill repine;

Like to the corpſlet old, the more tis bet

vvith hammer hard, more hardnes it doth get.

Th. Hudſon.

This ill preſage aduiſedly ſhe marketh,

Euen as the winde is huſht before it raineth,

Or as the Wolfe doth grin before he barketh,

Or as the berry breakes before it ſtaineth,

Or like the deadly bullet of a gunne,

His meaning ſtrooke her ere his words begun.

W. Shakeſpeare.

### 1.283. Astonishment.

Like as the tiller of the fruitfull ground

vvith ſuddaine ſtorme and tempeſt is aſtoniſhed▪

vvho ſees the flaſh, and heares the thunders ſound,

And for their maiſters ſake the cattell puniſhed:

Or when by hap a faire old Pine he found

By force of raging wind his leaues diminiſhed:

So ſtood amazd the Pagan in that place,

His Lady preſent at that wofull caſe.

I. Harrington.

Euen as a Wolfe by pinching famine led

That in the field a carrion beaſt doth finde,

[[Page 447]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=231)On which
before the doggs and Rauens haue fed,

And nothing left but bones and hornes behind,

Stands ſtill and gazeth on the carkaſſe dead:

So at this ſight the Pagan Prince repind,

And curſeth oft, and cals himſelfe a beaſt,

For comming tardy to ſo rich a feaſt.

Idem.

Like to a man who walking in the graſſe

Vpon a Serpent ſuddenly doth tread,

Plucks backe his foote, and turnes away his face,

His colour fading pale, as he were dead:

Thus he the place▪ thus he the act doth ſhun,

Lothing to ſee what he before had done.

M. Drayton.

Looke how the God of wiſedome marbled ſtands

Beſtowing Laurell wreaths of dignitie

In Delphos Ile, at whoſe impartiall hands

Hang antique ſcrolles of gentle Herauldry,

And at his feete enſignes and trophies lie,

Such was my ſtate, whom euery man did follow,

As liuing ſtatue of the great Apollo.

Th. Storer.

All as the hungry winter-ſtarued earth,

vvhen ſhe by nature labours towards her birth,

Still as the day vpon the darke world creepes

One bloſſome forth after another peepes,

Till the ſmall flower whoſe roote is now vnbound,

Gets from the froſtie priſon of the ground,

Spreading the leaues vnto the powrefull noone

Deckt in freſh colours, ſmiles vpon the ſunne.

[[Page 448]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=232)Neuer
vnquiet care lodge in that breſt

Where but one thought of Roſamond did reſt.

M. Drayton.

### 1.284. Courage.

Like as a fire the which in hollow caue

Hath long beene vnder-kept and downe ſuppreſt,

With murmure as diſdaine doth inly raue,

And grudge in ſo ſtraite priſon to be preſt,

At laſt breakes forth with furious vnreſt,

And ſtriues to mount vnto his natiue ſeate:

All that did erſt it hinder and moleſt,

It now deuoures with flames and ſcorching heat,

And carries into ſmoke, with rage and horror great,

So mightily the Brittaine Prince him rouſd

Out of his hold.

Edm. Spencer.

As he that ſtriues to ſtop a ſudden flood

And in ſtrong bands his violence incloſe,

Forceth it ſwell aboue his wonted moode,

And largely ouer-flows the fruitfull plaine,

That all the country ſeemes to be a maine,

And the rich furrowes flote all quite fordone,

The wofull husbandman doth lowd complaine

To ſee his whole yeeres labour loſt ſo ſoone,

For which to God he made ſo many an idle boone,

So him he held, and did through might amate.

Idem.

Like as a Saphire hanging downe the breaſt

A farre more orient glittering doth make,

Then doth a Diamond of good requeſt

[[Page 449]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=232)Set in a
bracelet, and more glory take,

Not for the vertue but the places ſake.

So did a clowdy ſaphire dimme my light,

Not with his worth, but with his places height.

Th. Storer.

### 1.285. Of Adam.

Thou ſeeſt no wheat Helleborus can bring,

Nor barly from the madding Morrell ſpring,

Nor bleating lambes braue lyons do not breed,

That leaprous parents raiſe a leaprous feed.

Euen ſo our grandſyre liuing innocent

Had ſtockt the whole world with a ſaint deſcent.

But ſuffering ſinne in Eden him inuade,

His ſonnes the ſoones of ſinne and wrath he made.

I. Sylueſter.

As done the pots that long retaines the taſte

Of licour, ſuch as firſt was in them plaſte:

Or like the tree that bends his elder braunch

That way where firſt the ſtroke had made his launch [...]

So ſee we wolfes and beares and harts full old,

Some tameneſſe from their daunted youth to hold.

Th. Hudſon.

—Loues fiery dart

Could nere vnfreeze the froſt of her chaſte hart:

But as the diamond bides the hammer ſtrong,

So ſhe reſiſted all her ſuters long.

Idem.

[[Page 450]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=233)

### 1.286. Drunkards.

The more he dranke, the more he did deſire,

Like to the Ocean ſea, though it receaues

All Nilus flouds, yet all freſh water craues

From Eaſt to Weſt, yet growes he not a graine,

But ſtill is ready for as much againe.

Idem.

* The ſtaues like yce in ſhiuers ſmall did flie,

The ſplints like byrds did mount vnto the skie.

M. Drayton.

### 1.287. Ill Companie.

Like as the perfect Pylot feares to runne

Vpon the rocks, with ſingling ſheet doth ſhunne

Cydnaees ſtraits ot Syrtes ſinking ſands,

Or cruell Capharois with ſtormy ſtrands.

So wiſely ſhe diſhaunted the reſort

Of ſuch as were ſuſpect of light report.

Well knowing that the quaintance with the ill

Corrupts the good, and though they euer ſtill

Th. Hudſon. Fol. 452.

* Looke how the peacocke ruffes his flanting taile,

And ſtrutts vnder his mooned canapie:

And how he quiuers with his mooned ſaile,

Yet when his lead pale legs he haps to ſee,

With ſhame abates his painted iollitie.

The King as proud as peacocke in his loue,

Yet droupes again when words nor tears will moue.

M. Drayton.

[[Page 451]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=233)

### 1.288. Night.

Looke how a bright ſtarre ſhooteth from the skie,

So glides he in the night from Venus eye,

Which after him ſhe darts as on a ſhore,

Gazing vpon a late embarqued frend,

Till the wild waues will haue them ſee no more,

Whoſe ridges with the meeting cloudes contend.

So did the mercileſſe and pitchy night

Fold in the obiect that did feed her ſight.

W. Sha.

### 1.289. King.

When as the Sun forſakes his chriſtall ſpheare,

How darke and vgly is the gloomy skie?

And in his place ther's nothing well appeare,

But cloudes that in his glorious circuit flie.

So when a King forſakes his royall place,

There ſtill ſucceed oblique and darke diſgrace.

Ch. Middleton

Looke how the day hater Mineruaes bird,

Whileſt priuiledged with darknes and the night:

Doth liue ſecure himſelfe of others feard,

But if by chaunce diſcouered in the light,

O how each little foule with enuy ſtird,

Calls him to iuſtice, vrges him with ſpight,

Summons the feathered flocks of all the wood,

To come to ſcorne the tyrants of their blood,

So fares the King laid open to diſgrace.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 452]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=234)

And forth hee's brought vnto the accompliſhment,

Deckt with the crowne and princely robes that day:

Like as the dead in other lands are ſent

Vnto their graues in all their beſt aray.

And euen like good did him this ornament.

For what he brought he muſt not beare away,

But buries there his glory and his name,

Intomb'd for euermore in others blame.

Idem.

### 1.290. Companie.

Remaine vpright, yet ſome will quarrell pike,

And common brute will deeme them all alike.

For looke how your companions you elect

For good or ill, ſo ſhall you be ſuſpect.

Th. Hudſon.

### 1.291. Of Victorie.

Like as whilome that ſtrong Tyranthian ſwaine

Brought forth with him the dreadfull dog of hell:

Againſt his will faſt bound in yron chaine,

And roring horribly did him compell

To ſee the hatefull ſun, that he might tell

To griſly Pluto what on earth was donne,

And to the other damned ghoaſts which dwell

For aye in darkneſſe, which day-light doth ſhunne,

So led he forth this captiue, and like conqueſt woone.

Ed. Spencer.

Like as in ſommers day when raging heate

Doth burne the earth and boyled riuers drie:

That all brute beaſts forſte to refraine from meate

[[Page 453]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=234)Do hunt
for ſhade where ſhrowded they may lie.

And miſſing it, faine from themſelues to flie

All trauailers tormented are with paine:

A mightie cloud doth ouercaſt the skie,

And powreth forth a ſuddaine ſhowre of raine,

That all the wretched world recomforteth againe.

So did the warlike Britomart reſtore

The prize of knights of mayden-head that day.

Idem.

As when a troupe of harueſt thrifty ſwaines

With cutting ſythes earth ripened riches mowes,

Whole ſheaues of corne lye ſtrowen vpon the plaines.

So fall the Scots before the conquering foes.

D. Lodge.

### 1.292. Death.

On Appenine like as a ſturdy tree

Againſt the windes that makes reſiſtance ſtout:

If with a ſtorme it ouerturned bee,

Falles downe and breakes the trees and plants about:

So Latine fell, and with him felled hee,

And ſlew the neareſt of the Pagan rout.

Ed. Fairfax.

Like as the ſacred oxe that careleſſe ſtands

With gilden hornes and flowry girlonds crownd:

Proud of his dying honour and deare bands,

Whileſt Theaters fume with frankenſence around,

All ſuddenly with mortall ſtroke aſtoind,

Doth grouelling fall, and with his ſteaming gore

Diſtaines the pillers and the holy ground.

[[Page 454]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=235)And the
faire flowers that decked him afore,

So fell proud Marinell vpon the precious ſhore.

Ed. Spencer.

Like as a ſhippe whom cruell tempeſt driues

Vpon a rocke with horrible diſmay,

Her ſhattered ribbes in thouſand peeces riues,

And ſpoyling all her geares and goodly ray,

Does make her ſelfe misfortunes piteous pray.

So downe the cliffe the wretched giant tombled.

Idem.

Like an autumall ſtarre which ruddy doth foreſhewe

Some death, ſome peſtilence, ſome bloudy ouerthrowe

He buskles with his foe, the aſſailant he aſſaults,

And reſolute he markes his arrowes weake defaults.

Then entring in betweene his breſt plate and his baſes,

He ſeeks his ſinful ſoule, there finds, & thence it chaſes.

I. Syl.

### 1.293. Fight.

Like as two maſtiffe dogs with hungry iawes,

Mou'd firſt to hate, from hate to raging ire:

Approach with grinning teeth and griſly iawes,

With ſtaring eyes as red as flaming fire.

At laſt they bite and ſcratch with teeth and clawes,

Tearing themſelues, and trembling in the mire.

So after biting and reproachfull words,

Sarcapant and Rinaldo drew their ſwords.

Ed. Spencer.

Like as an exhalation hot and drie,

Amongſt the aire bred moiſty vapours throwne

[[Page 455]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=235)Spilleth
his lightening forth couragiouſly,

Renting the thick clouds with a thunder-ſtone,

As though the huge all couering heauen did grone.

Such is the garboyle of this conflict then,

Braue Engliſh men encountring Engliſh men.

M. Drayton.

Like as ye ſee the wallowing ſea to ſtriue

Flood after flood, and waue with waue to driue:

Thē waues with waues, thē floods with floods to chace,

And eft returnes vnto their former place.

Or like the crops of corne in midſt of May,

(Blowne vp with weſterne wind) aſide do ſway,

Both too and fro as force doth them conſtraine,

And yet their tops redreſſeth vp againe.

So whiles the Sirians are by Medes diſplaced,

And whiles the Medes by Syrians are rechaced.

Th. Hudſon.

Like as a puttock hauing ſpied in ſight

A gentle faulchon ſitting on a hill,

Whoſe other wing now made vnmeet for flight,

Was lately broken by ſome fortune ill.

The fooliſh kite led with licentious will,

Doth beat vpon the gentle byrd in vaine,

With many idle ſtoopes her troubling ſtill.

Euen ſo did Radagond with bootleſſe paine,

Annoy this noble knight, and ſorely him conſtraine.

Ed. Spencer.

Euen as an Eagle that eſpies from hie,

Among the hearbes a partie coloured ſnake:

Or on a banke ſunning her ſelfe to lie,

Caſting the elder skin, anew to make

[[Page 456]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=236)Lies
houering warily till ſhe may ſpie

Aduantage ſure the venomd worme to take:

Then takes him by the backe and beats her wings,

Maugre the poyſon of his forked ſtings,

So doth Rogero both with ſword and ſpeare,

The cruell monſter warily aſſaile.

S. I. Harr.

Like as a mountaine or a cape of land,

Aſſaild with ſtormes, and ſailes on euery ſide

Doth vnremoued ſtedfaſt ſtill withſtand,

Storme, thunder, lightning, tempeſt, wind and tide.

The Souldan ſo withſtood Latinus band.

Ed. Fairfax.

So thicke flew flouds and darts that no man ſees

The azurde heauens, the ſunne his brightnes loſt:

The cloudes of weapons like to ſwarmes of bees

Met in the aire, and there each other croſt.

And looke how falling leaues drop downe from trees

When the moyſt ſappe is mixt with liuely froſt,

Or apples in ſtrong windes from braunches fall,

The Sarazens ſo tumbled from the wall.

Idem.

As when a windy tempeſt bloweth hie,

That nothing may withſtand his ſtormy ſtowre,

The cloudes as things afraid before him flie,

But all ſo ſoone as his outragious power

Is laid, they fairly then begin to ſhowre,

And as in ſtorme of his ſpent ſtormy ſpight,

Now all at once their malice forth do powre.

So did Sir Guion beare himſelfe in fight,

And ſuffered raſh Pirrocles want his idle might.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 457]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=236)

As Eagle freſh out of the Ocean waue,

Where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray,

And deckt himſelfe with feathers youthly gay,

Like Eyas hauke vpmounting to the skies,

His newly budded pinions to aſſay,

And maruells at himſelfe ſtill as he flies,

So new, this newborne knight to battle did ariſe.

Idem.

As gentle ſhepheard in ſweete euen-tide,

When ruddy Phoebus gins to walke in weſt,

He on an hill his flocke to viewen wide,

Markes which do bite his heartie ſupper beſt.

A cloud of combrous gnats do him moleſt,

All ſtriuing to infixe their feeble ſtings,

That from their noyance, he no where can reſt,

But with his clowniſh hands their tender wings

He bruſheth off, and oft doth marre their murmurings.

Ed. Sp.

—They him eſpying, both with greedie force

At once vpon him ranne, and him beſet

With ſtroakes of mortall ſteele, without remorſe,

And on his ſhield like Iron ſledges bet,

As when a Beare and Tigre being met,

In cruell fight on Libicke Ocean wide,

Eſpide a traueller with feet ſurbet,

Whom they in equall pray hope to deuide,

They ſtint their ſtrife, and him aſſaile on euery ſide.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.294. Of noiſe. Clamour.

As great a noiſe as when in Cymbrian plaine,

An heard of bulls, whom kindly rage doth ſting,

[[Page 458]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=237)Do for the
milky mothers want complaine,

And fill the fields with troublous bellowing,

The neighbor woods around with hollow murmuring.

Ed. Sp.

As when the ſhapeleſſe huge Leuiaethan

Hath thruſt himſelfe vpon the ſandie ſhore,

Where (monſterlike) affrighting euery man,

He belloweth out a fearefull deadly rore.

Euen ſuch a Clamour through the aire doth thunder,

The dolefull preſage of ſome fearefull wonder.

M. Drayton.

### 1.295. Ioy.

Much like as when the beaten marriner

That long hath wandred in the Ocean wide,

Oft ſow'ſt in ſwelling Tethis ſaltiſh teare,

And Long time hauing tamde his tawnie hide,

With bluſtering breath of heauen that none can bide,

And ſcorching flames of fierce Orions hound,

Soone as the port from far he hath eſpide,

His chearefull whiſtle merily doth ſound,

And Nereus crownes with cups, his mates him pledge around,

Such Ioy made Ʋna when her knight ſhe found.

Ed. Spencer.

Looke how a troupe of winter priſoned dames,

Pent in the incloſure of the walled townes,

Welcomes the ſpring vſher to ſommers flames,

Making their paſ [...]imes on the flowry downes,

Whoſe beautious Arras wrought in natures frames,

Through eies admire, the heart with wonder crownes.

[[Page 459]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=237)So theſe
wood-walled citizens at ſea,

Welcome be both ſpring and ſommer in a day.

I. Markham.

Like as a ſhip with dreadfull ſtorme long toſt,

Hauing ſpent all her maſts and her ground hold,

Now farre from harbour, like to be loſt,

At laſt ſome fiſher barke doth neare betold,

That giueth comfort to her courage cold:

Such was the ſtate of this moſt knight.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.296. Pollicie.

As when to purge exceſſiue moiſt deſcending,

From Saturns ſpheare, or elſe ſuperfluous heate,

Ioue ſtird vp by Mars (common good entending)

Sends lightning flaſh to lay their angry threate.

So wiſer heads that knew the ſcourge of warre,

Sought ſooth faſt meanes to mitigate the iarre.

D. Lodge.

As when a skilfull marriner doth read

A ſtorme approaching that doth perill threate,

He will not bide the danger of ſuch dread,

Bur ſtrikes his ſailes and vereth his maniſheat,

And lends vnto it leaue the emptie aire to beate:

So did the faiery knight himſelfe abeare.

Ed. Spencer.

As Pilot well expert in perillous waue,

That to a ſteadfaſt ſtarre his courſe hath bent,

When foggy miſts or cloudie tempeſts haue,

The faithfull light of that faire lampy blent,

[[Page 460]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=238)And
couered heauen with hidious dreriment,

Vpon his card and compaſſe formes his eie,

The maiſters of his long experiment.

And to them does the ſteddie helme applie,

Bidding his winged veſſell fairely forward flie.

So Guion.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.297. Labour.

Like as ye ſee ſometimes the honey bees,

Exerce themſelues on buds of ſweeteſt tree,

Where they ſometime aſſault the buzzing waſpe,

That come too neare, their flames away to claſpe.

Or when they honey draw from ſmelling time,

Or from the palme or roſes of the prime,

And how they draw their waxe with wondrous art,

Obſeruing ioynture iuſt in euery part:

Both vp and downe, they build ten thouſand ſhops,

With equall ſpace fulfild vp to the tops.

Or where the maiſter Bee of thouſand bands,

Conducts the reſt in legions through the lands,

Who daily keepes within their Citie wall,

Their houſe, their worke, their lawes, and maners all.

So thus the ſonnes of Iacob plide their paine,

With whole deſire their quarell to ſuſtaine.

Th. Hudſon.

As do thoſe Emmets that in ſommer tide

Come out in ſwarmes their houſes to prouide,

In harueſt time (their toile may beſt be ſeene,

In pathes where they their carriage bring betweene,

[[Page 461]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=238)The ſicke
and old at home do keepe the ſcore,

And ouer grainell great they take the charge,

Oft turning corne within a chamber large,

(When it is dight) leaſt it do ſprout or ſeed,

Or come againe, or we eulls in it breed.

While the Armorers with armour hard and great,

On ſtudies ſtrong the ſturdie ſteele do beate,

And makes thereof, a corpſlet or a Iacke,

Sometime a helme, ſometime a mace doth make,

Whiles ſhepheards they enarme vnvſde to danger,

Whiles ſimple heards, & whiles the wandring ſtranger

The tilling culter then a ſpeare was made,

The crooked Sithe became an euened blade:

The people foode forgets, no eaſe they take,

Some on an horſe, ſome on his proper backe,

Some on a cart, ſome on a camell beares

Corne, wine, and fleſh, to ſerue for many yeares.

Th. Hudſon.

### 1.298. Warre.

Like to a riuer that is ſtopt his courſe,

Doth violate his bankes, breakes his owne head.

Deſtroyes his bounds, and ouerruns by force

The neighbour fieldes, in regularly ſpread.

Euen ſo this ſudden ſtop of Warre doth nurſe

Home toiles within it ſelfe from others lead,

So daungerous the chaunge thereof is tried,

Ere mindes come ſoft, or otherwiſe imploide.

S. Daniell.

[[Page 462]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=239)

### 1.299. Astoniſhment

As when the maſt of ſome well timbred hulke,

Is with the blaſt of ſome outragious ſtorme

Blowne downe, it ſhakes the bottome of the bulke,

And makes her ribs to cracke as they were torne,

Whil'ſt ſtill ſhe ſtands aſtoniſht and forlorne:

So was he ſtound with ſtroake of her huge taile.

Ed. Spencer.

—Lying ſtill a while both did forget,

The perillous preſent ſtownd wherein their liues were ſet,

As when two warlike brigandines at ſea,

With murdrous weapons armd in cruell fight,

Do meete together on the watrie Lea.

They ſtem each other with ſo fell deſpight,

That with the ſhocke of their owne heedleſſe might,

Their woodden ribs are ſhaken right aſunder.

They which from ſhore behold the dreadfull fight

Of flaſhing fier, and here the Ordinance thunder,

So greatly ſtand amaz'd of ſuch vnwonted wonder.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.300. Care of children.

All as the painefull ploughman plies his toile,

With ſhare and culter ſhearing through the ſoile

That coſts him deare, and ditches it about,

Or crops his hedge to make it vnderſprout,

And neuer ſtaies to ward it from the weede,

But moſt reſpects to ſowe therein good ſeede:

[[Page 463]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=239)To th'end
when ſommer decks the medowes plaine,

He may haue recompence of coſts and paine.

Or like the maide, who carefull is to keepe

The budding flowre, that firſt begins to peepe

Out of the knop, and waters it full oft,

To make it ſeemely ſhew the head aloft,

That it may (when ſhe drawes it from the ſtocks)

Adorne her gorget white, and golden locks.

So wiſe Merari all his ſtudie ſtild,

To faſhion well the maners of his child.

Th. Hudſon.

### 1.301. Libertie.

Like to a Lion that eſcapes his bownds,

Hauing bene long reſtraind his vſe to ſtray,

Raunges the reſtleſſe woods, ſtaies on no ground.

Riots with bloudſhed, wantons with his pray,

Seekes not for need, but in his pride to wound,

Glorying to ſee his ſtrength, and what he may.

So this vnbridled King, freed of his feares,

In libertie himſelfe vnwildly beares.

S. Daniell.

* Like as the hauke which ſoareth in the skie,

And climes aloft for ſolace of her wing,

The greater gate ſhe getteth vp on hie,

The truer ſtoope ſhe makes to any thing:

So ſhall you ſee my muſe by wandring,

Find out at laſt the right and ready way,

And keepe it ſure, though erſt it went aſtray.

G. Gaſcoigne.

[[Page 464]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=240)

* Like as the ſhip that through the Ocean wide

Directs her courſe, vnto one certaine coaſt,

Is met with many a counterwind and tide,

With which her winged ſpeed is let and croſt.

And ſhe her ſelfe in ſtormie ſurges loſt.

Yet making many a boord and many a bay,

Still winneth way, and hath her compaſt loſt.

Right ſo it fares with me in this long way,

Whoſe courſe is often ſtaid, yet neuer is aſtray.

Ed. Spencer.

* — As ſhe was looking in a glaſſe,

She ſawe therein a mans face looking on her:

Whereat ſhe ſtarted from the frighted glaſſe,

As if ſome monſtrous ſerpent had bene ſhewen her:

Riſing as when the ſunne in Leo ſigne,

Auriga with the heauenly goale vpon her,

Shewes her hornd head, with her kids diuine.

Whoſe riſe kils vines, heauens face with ſtormes diſ­guiſing,

No man is ſafe at ſea, the Haedy riſing.

So ſtraight wrapt ſhe her body in a cloude,

And threatned tempeſt for her high diſgrace,

Shame from a bowre of Roſes did vnſhrowde,

And ſpread her crimſon wings vpon her face.

G. Chapman.

### 1.302. Multitude.

Like when ſome maſtiffe whelpe diſpoſd to play,

A whole confuſed heard of beeſts doth chaſe,

Which with one vile conſent runne all away,

If any hardier then the reſt in place.

[[Page 465]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=240)But turne
the head that idle feare to ſtay,

Backe ſtrait the daunted chacer turnes his face:

And all the reſt with bold example led,

As faſt runne on him as before they fled.

So with this bold oppoſer ruſhes on

This many headed monſter multitude.

S. Daniell.

As when the daughter of Thaumantes faire

Hath in a watry cloud diſplaied wide

Her goodly bowe which paints the liquid aire,

That all men wonder at her colours pride:

All ſuddenly ere one can looke aſide,

The glorious picture vaniſheth away,

Ne any token doth thereof abide.

So did this Ladies goodly forme decay,

And into nothing goe, ere one could it bewray.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.303. Beautie.

Like as a tender Roſe in open plaine,

That with vntimely drought nigh withered was

And hung the head; ſoone as fewe drops of raine

Thereon diſtill and deaw her daintie face,

Gins to looke vp, and with freſh counted grace

Diſpreds the glory of her leaues gaye,

Such was Iraenas countenance, ſuch her grace.

Idem.

Like as the wind and tide when they do meet▪

With enuious oppoſitions do affright

The leſſer ſtreames running for to regreet

[[Page 466]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=241)The Ocean
Empire, ſo do theſe two fight,

One labours to bring all things to his will,

The other cares for to preuent that ill.

Ch. Middleton.

### 1.304. Deſcriptions of Pallaces, Caſtles, &c.

A ſtately Pallace built of ſquared bricke,

Which cunningly was without morter laid,

Whoſe walles were high, but nothing ſtrong nor thick,

And golden foyle all ouer them diſplaid.

That pureſt skie with brightneſſe they diſmaid,

High lifted vp were many lofty towres,

And goodly galleries farre ouerlaid:

Full of fayre windowes and delightfull bowres,

And on the top a dyall told the timely howres.

Ed. Sp.

The ſoueraigne Caſtels of the rocky yle,

Wherein Penelope the Princes lay:

Shone with a thouſand lampes, which did exile

The dimme darke ſhades, and turnd the night to day.

Not Ioues blew tent what time the ſunny ray

Behind the bulwarke of the earth retires,

Is ſeene to ſparkle with more ſprinkling fires.

I. Dauies.

### 1.305. Logiſtillaes Caſtle.

—Such a Caſtle that in ſtately ſhowe

And coſtly ſubſtance others all ſurmounted:

The valew of the walles cannot man knowe,

Except he firſt vpon the ſame had mounted.

[[Page 467]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=241)Men haue
not Iewels of ſuch price belowe,

Diamonds are to theſe but droſſe accounted.

Pearles are but pelfe, and Rubies all are rotten

Where ſtones of ſuch rare vertue can be gotten.

Theſe walles are built of ſtones of ſo great price,

All other vnto theſe come far behinde,

In theſe men ſee the vertue and the vice

That cleaueth to the inward ſoule and minde,

As neither flattering praiſes ſhall him blinde

With tickling words nor vndeſerued blame,

With forged faults ſhal worke him any ſhame:

From hence doth come the euerlaſting light,

That may with Phaebus beames ſo cleare compare,

That when the Sunne is downe there is no night

With thoſe that with thoſe Iewels ſtored are.

Theſe gems do teach vs to diſcerne aright.

Theſe gems are wrought with workemanſhip ſo rare,

That hard it were to make true eſtimation

Which is more hard the ſubſtance or the faſhion.

On arches raiſd of Porphorie paſſing hie,

Were gardens faire, and pleaſant to the eie.

So hie, that to aſcend them ſeemd a paine,

Fewe found ſo rare below vpon a plaine.

Sweet ſmelling trees in order ſtanding bee,

With Fountaines watering them in ſtead of raine,

Which doth the ſame ſo naturally nouriſh,

As all the yeare both flowers and fruites do flouriſh.

No weeds or fruitleſſe trees are in this place,

But hearbes whoſe vertues are of chiefeſt price,

As ſoueraigne ſage, and thrift, and hearbes of grace,

And Tyme, which well beſtowed maketh wiſe:

[[Page 468]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=242)And lowly
patience proud thoughts to abaſe,

And harts eaſe that can neuer grow with vice.

Theſe are the hearbes that in this garden grew,

Whoſe vertues to their beauties ſtill renew.

S. I. H.

—She then led vp to the caſtle wall

That was ſo hie as foe might not it clime▪

And all ſo faire and ſenſible withall,

Not built of bricke, ne yet of ſtone and lime,

But of thing like to that Egyptian ſlime.

Whereof King Nine whilom built Babell towne,

The frame thereof ſeemd party circuler,

And part tryangulare, ô worke diuine,

Thoſe two the firſt and laſt proportions are,

The one imperfect mortall feminine,

The other immortall, perfect maſculine.

And twixt them both, a quadrate was the baſe,

Proportioned equally by ſeuen and nine:

Nine was the circle ſet in heauens place,

All which compacted, made a goodly Diapaze.

Ed. Spencer.

Vp to a ſtately Turret ſhe them led,

Aſcending by ten ſteps of Alablaſter wrought.

That Turrets frame moſt admirable was,

Like higheſt heauen compaſſed around:

And lifted hie aboue this earthly maſſe,

Which it ſuruewd as hills do lower ground,

But on ground, mote not like to this be found.

Not that which Antique Camus whilom built

In Thebes, which Alexander did confound.

Nor that proud towne of Troy though richly guilt,

[[Page 469]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=242)From which
young Herods blood by cruel Greeks was ſpilt,

The roofe thereof was arched ouer head:

And deckt with flowres and arbors daintily,

Two goodly beacons, ſet in watches ſtead,

Therein gaue light and flam'd continually:

For they of liuing fier moſt ſubtilly

Were made and ſet in ſiluer ſocketts bright:

Couered with lids deuizde of ſubſtance,

That readily they ſhut and open might,

O who can tell the praiſes of this makers might?

Idem.

Faire roome the preſence of ſweet Beauties pride,

The place the ſunne vpon the earth did hold:

When Phaethon his chariot did miſguide,

The towne where Ioue raind downe himſelfe in gold,

O if Elizium be aboue the ground,

Then here it is where nought but ioy is found.

Th. Naſhe.

Loe Colin here the place whoſe pleaſant ſight

From other ſhades hath weand my wandring minde:

Tell me what wanteth here to worke delight?

The ſimple aire, the gentle warbling winde,

So calme, ſo coole, as no where els I finde:

The graſſie ground with daintie daizies dight,

The bramble buſh where byrds of euery kinde,

To the waters fall, their tunes attemper right.

Ed. Spencer.

In little time theſe Ladies found

A groue with euery pleaſure crownd:

At whoſe ſweet entry did reſound

A ford, that flowred that holy ground,

[[Page 470]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=243)From
thence the ſweet breath'd windes conuay

Odours from euery mirtle ſpray,

And other flowers: to whoſe aray

A hundred Harpes and Timbrels play

All pleaſures ſtudy can inuent,

The Dames eares inſtantly preſent:

Voyces in all ſorts different,

The foure parts and the Diapent.

G. Chapman.

—On the other ſide a pleaſant groue

Was ſhot vp hie, full of the ſtately tree,

That dedicated is to Olympicke Ioue:

And to his ſonne Alcides, when as he

Gaind in Nemea goodly victorie:

Therein the merry byrds of euery ſort

Chaunted aloud their chearfull harmonie.

And made amongſt themſelues a ſweet conſent,

That quickened the dull ſprites with muſicall conſent.

Ed. Spencer.

Vpon this mount there ſtood a ſtately groue,

Whoſe reaching armes to clip the welkin ſtroue,

Of tufted Cedars and the braunching Pine,

Whoſe buſhy tops themſelues do ſo intwine,

As ſeemd when nature firſt this worke begunne.

She then conſpirde againſt the piercing Sunne.

Vnder whoſe couert (thus diuinely made)

Phebus greene lawrell flouriſht in the ſhade.

Faire Venus mirtle, Mars his warlike firrhe,

Mineruaes Oliue, and the weeping mirrhe.

The patient Palme which ſtriues in ſpight of hate,

The Poplar to Alcides conſecrate.

[[Page 471]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=243)Which
nature in ſuch order had diſpoſed,

And therewithall their goodly workes encloſed:

As ſeru'd for hangings and rich tapeſtry,

To bewtifie this ſtately gallery.

M. Drayton.

So faire a church as this had Venus none,

The walles were of diſcoulered Iaſper ſtone:

Wherein was Proteus caru'd, and ouer hed

A liuely vine of green-ſea-aggat ſpred:

Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,

And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung

Of chriſtal ſhining faire the pauement was,

The Towne of Seſtos call'd it Ʋenus glaſſe.

There might you ſee the Gods in ſundry ſhapes,

Committing heddy ryots, inceſts, rapes.

For vnderneath this radiant flower

Was Danaes ſtatue in a brazen Tower.

Ioue ſlily ſtealing from his ſiſters bed,

To dally with Idalian Ganymede.

And for his loue Europa bellowing loud,

And tumbling with the Rain-bow in a cloud.

Blood-quaffing Mars hauing the yron net,

With limping Vulcan and his Cyclops ſet.

Loue kindling fier to burne ſuch fiers as Troy,

Syluanus weeping for the louely boy,

That now is turned into a Cypreſſe tree,

Vnder whoſe ſhade the wood-gods loue to bee.

Ch. Marlowe.

Not that Coloſſus reared vp in Rhodes,

Nor hanging gardens houering in the skie:

Nor all the wonderous manſions and abodes

[[Page 472]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=244)In Egypt,
Lemnos, or in Italy.

Either for riches, cunning, or expence,

Might match this Labyrinth for excellence.

D. Lodge.

—Art ſtriuing to compare

With nature, did an arbor greene diſpred:

Framed of wanton yuie, flowring faire,

Through which the fragrant Eglantine did ſpred

His pricking armes entraild with Roſes red,

Which daintie odours round about them threw,

And all within with flowers was garniſhed:

That when mild Zephirus amongſt them blew,

Did breath out bountious ſmelles and painted colour ſhew.

Ed. Sp.

The Tower of Beautie whence alone did flowe

More heauenly ſtreames then former age had ſeene.

Taking their current from that learned hill,

Where lodge the brothers of admire and skil.

Amongſt the ſommer bloſſomes of their bowes,

A thouſand ſeuerall coloured byrds was ſet:

Who mou'd (as ſeem'd) by charitable vowes

Of excellent compaſſion, euer wet

With honourable teares (for Fates allowes

That ſenſible from ſenceleſſe ſtill ſhall ſet

Modells of pitie) learne there with melodie

To cheare mens minde foredone with miſerie.

I. Markham.

—He leads him to rhe higheſt mount,

That blood-red billowes like a walled front

On either ſide diſparted with his rod,

Till that his army dry foot through them yode

[[Page 473]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=244)Dwelt
fortie dayes vpon; where writ in ſtone

With bloudy letters by the hand of God,

The bitter doombe of death and balefull mone

He did receiue whiles flaſhing fire about him ſhonne.

Or like that ſacred hill whoſe head full hie

Adornd with fruitfull Oliues all around,

Is, as it were for endleſſe memorie

Of that deare Lord, who oft thereon was found,

For euer with a flowring garlond crownd.

Or like that pleaſant mount that is for aye,

Through famous Poets verſe each where renownd:

On which the thrice three learned Ladies play,

Their heauenly notes, and make full many a louely lay.

Ed. Spencer.

Right in the middeſt of the paradize

There ſtood a ſtately mount, on whoſe round top

A gloomy groue of mirtle trees did riſe:

Whoſe ſhady bowes ſharpe ſteele did neuer lop,

Nor wicked beaſts their tender buds did crop.

But like a girlond compaſſed the height,

And from their fruitfull ſides ſweet gumme did drop:

That all the ground with pretious deaw bedight,

Threw forth moſt dainty Odors & moſt ſweet delight.

And in the thickeſt couert of that ſhade,

There was a pleaſant arbor, not by art,

But of the trees owne inclination made.

Which knitting their ranke braunches part to part:

With wand in yuie twine intraild a thwart,

And Eglantine and Caprifoile among:

Faſhion'd aboue within their inmoſt part,

That neither Phaebus beams could through them thrōg,

[[Page 474]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=245)Nor Aeolus
ſharp blaſt could worke them any wrong.

Idem.

It was an hill plac't in an open plaine,

That round about was bordered with a wood

Of matchleſſe height, that ſeemd th'earth diſdaine:

In which all trees of honour ſtately ſtood,

And did all winter, as in ſommer bud,

Spreading pauilions for the birds to bowre,

Within their lower braunches ſung aloud,

And in the tops, the ſoaring haukes did towre,

Sitting like King of fowles in maieſtie and power,

And at the foote thereof, a gentle floud

His ſiluer waues did ſoftly tumble downe,

Vnmard with ragged moſſe of filthy mud.

Ne mote wild beaſts, ne mote the ruder clowne

Thereto approach, ne filth mote therein drowne,

But Nymphes and Fairies by the bankes did ſit

In the woods ſhade, which did the waters crowne,

Keeping all noiſome things away from it,

And to the waters fall tuning their accents fit.

And on the toppe thereof a ſpacious plaine,

Did ſpread it ſelfe to ſerue to all delight,

Either to daunce when they to daunce would faine,

Or elſe to courſe about their baſes light.

Ne ought there wanted which for pleaſure might

Deſired be, or thence to baniſh bale,

So pleaſantly the hill with equall height,

Did ſeeme to ouerlooke the lowly vale.

Therefore it rightly cleped was, Mount Acidale.

They ſay that Ʋenus when ſhe did diſpoſe

Her ſelfe to pleaſance, vied to reſort

[[Page 475]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=245)Vnto this
place, and therein to repoſe

And reſt her ſelfe as in a gladſome port,

Or with the graces there to play and ſport.

Ed. Spencer.

It was a choſen plot of fertile land

Amongſt the wild waues ſet like a litle neſt,

As if it had by natures cunning hand

Bene choicely picked out from all the reſt,

And laid forth for enſample of the beſt.

No daintie flower nor hearbe that growes on ground,

No arboret with painted bloſſomes dreſt,

And ſmelling ſweete, but there it might be found

To bud out faire, & her ſweet ſmels throw all around.

No tree whoſe braunches did not brauely ſpring,

No braunch wherein a fine bird did not ſit,

No bird but did her ſhrill notes euer ſing,

No ſong but did containe a louely dit.

Trees, braunches, birds, and ſongs were framed fit,

For to allure fraile minds to careleſſe eaſe.

Idem.

### 1.306. Groaue.

A ſandy Groaue not farre away they ſpide,

That promiſd aid the tempeſt to withſtand,

Whoſe loftie trees yclad with ſommers pride,

Did ſpread ſo broade, that heauens light did hide.

Not pierceable with power of any ſtarre,

And all within were pathes and allies wide,

With footing worne, and leading inward farre.

Ed. Spencer.

[[Page 476]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=246)

The porch was all of Porphyrie and Tutch,

In which the ſumptuous building raiſed was:

With Images that ſeem'd to moue, ſee, touch.

Some hewd in ſtone, ſome caru'd in round cut braſſe.

Alſo within the beauty was as much,

Vnder a ſtately arch they ſtrait did paſſe

Vnto a court that good proportion bare,

And was each way one hundred cubits ſquare.

Each of theſe ſides a porch had paſsing faire,

That with an arch is into colours placed:

Of equall ſiſe they ſeemed euery paire,

Yet ſundry workes with them they better graced.

At each of theſe a wide large eaſie ſtaire,

Without the which all buildings are defaced.

And thoſe ſame ſtaires ſo lately mounting, led

Each to a chamber richly furniſhed.

The colours hie, the chaplets gilt with gold,

The corniſhes inricht with things of coſt:

The marbles ſet from farre, and dearly ſold,

By cunning workemen carued and emboſt

With Images and Antiques new and old.

Though now the night thereof concealed moſt,

Shew that that worke ſo rich beyond all meaſure,

Could ſcant be builded with a Princes treaſure.

But nothing did ſo much the ſight inrich,

As did the plenteous fountaine that did ſtand

Iuſt placed in the middle, vnder which

The Pages ſpred a Table out of hand,

And brought forth napery rich, and plate more rich:

And meats the choyſeſt of the ſea or land.

For though the houſe had ſtately roomes full many,

[[Page 477]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=246)Yet in the
ſommer this was beſt of any,

This fountaine was by curious workemen brought

To anſwere to the reſt with double ſquare,

Eight female ſtatues of white marble wrought,

With their left hands an azure skie vpbare,

With raining ſtill expelled heate and drought

From all that vnder it or neare it are.

In theſe right hands was Amaltheas horne,

By euery one of thoſe eight ſtatures borne.

Each of thoſe ſtatues reſted both their feete,

Vpon two Images of men belowe,

That ſeemd delighted with the noiſe ſo ſweete,

That from the water came that there did flowe,

Alſo they ſeemd the Ladies lowly greete,

As though they did their names and vertues knowe.

In all their hands they held long ſcrowles of writings,

Of their owne pennings, and their owne endightings:

And in faire golden letters were their names,

Both of the women wrought and of the men.

The women were eight chaſte and ſober dames

That now do liue, but were vnborne as then,

The men were Poets, that their worthy fames

In time to come, ſhould praiſe with learned pen.

Theſe Images bare vp a brazen treſſell,

On which there ſtood a large white marble veſſell:

This tooke the water from that Azure skie,

From whence with turning of ſome cocke or vice,

Great ſtore of water would mount vpon hie,

And wet all that ſame court euen in a trice.

S. I. Harrington.

And in a cloude of ſweete and rich perfumes,

Caſt vs into the lap of that greene meade,

Whoſe boſome ſtucke with purple Violets,

Halfe budded Lillies, and yoong Musk-roſe trees,

About whoſe waſte the amorous woodbine twines,

Whilſt they ſeeme maidens in a louers armes,

There on the curled forehead of a banke,

That ſweld with camomill, ouer whoſe bewtie

A wanton Hyacinth held downe his head,

And by the winds helpe oft ſtole may abide,

Amongſt the pumy ſtones and made a ſound

To lull himſelfe a ſleepe that by it lay.

The wearie traueller wandring that way,

Therein did often quench his thirſtie heate,

And then by it his wearie limmes diſplay,

Whiles creeping ſlumber made him to forget

His former paine, and wipe away his toylſome ſweate.

Faire Danubie is praiſd for being wide,

Nylus commended for his ſeuenfold head,

With Chriſtall ceſterns, moates a meade about.

I walkt along a ſtreame for pureneſſe rare,

Brighter then ſun-ſhine, for it did acquaint

That in the pibble paued chanell lay.

No molten Chriſtall, but a Richer mine,

Euen natures rareſt alchumie ran there,

Diamonds reſolud, and ſubſtance more diuine,

Through whoſe bright gliding current might appeare

A thouſand naked Nymphes, whoſe yuorie ſhine,

Where the day-ſhining ſunne in triumph ſate.

As kind companions in one vnion growes,

Folding their twindring armes as oft we ſee,

Lending to dulneſſe, feeling Sympathie.

And as a coſtly vallance ore a bed,

So was Acteons horned plant.

Great Whirpooles which all Fiſhes make to flie:

Bright Scholopendraes, arm'd with ſiluer ſcales,

Mightie Monoceros, with immeaſured tailes:

The dreadfull Fiſh that doth deſerue the name

Of death, and like him lookes in dreadfull hue,

The griſly waſſerman that makes his game

The flying ſhips with ſwiftneſſe to purſue.

The horrible ſea-Satyre, that doth ſhewe

His fearful face in time of greateſt ſtorme

Huge Ziffius whom mariners do eſchewe,

No leſſe then rockes (as trauailers informe)

And greedy Roſmarines with viſages deforme.

Ed. Sp.

Is the braue Normans courage now forgot?

Or the bold Britons loſt the vſe of ſhot?

The big bon'd Almains and ſtout Brabanters?

Or do the Piccards let the Crosbowes lie?

Once like the Centaurs of old Theſſaly.

Percht there vpon an Oake aboue:

Praier ſweete charming, faſting, hairy clad.

I. Syl.

— In one conſort there ſate

Cruell reuenge, and rancorous deſpight,

Diſloyall treaſon, and heart-burning hate,

But gnawing Iealouzie out of their ſight

Sitting alone, his bitter lips did bite,

And trembling feare ſtill too and fro did flie,

And found no place where ſafe he ſhrowd him might.

Lamenting ſorrowe did in darkeneſſe lie,

And ſhame his vgly face did hide from liuing eie.

M. Drayton.

Freſh ſhadowes fit to ſhrowd from ſunny ray,

Faire fawnes to take the ſunne in ſeaſon due,

ſprings in which a thouſand bubbles play.

Soft rombling brookes, that gentle ſlomber drew.

High reared mounts, the lands about to vew.

Low looking dales, disioynd from common game,

Delightful bowres, to ſolace louers true.

Falſe Labyrinths, fond runners eyes to daze,

All which by nature made, did natures ſelfe amaze.

Ed. Spencer.

* Behind Cupid were reproach, repentance, ſhame,

Reproach the firſt, ſhame next, repent behinde:

Repentance feeble, ſorrowfull and lame.

Reproach deſpightfull, careleſſe and vnkinde,

Shame moſt il-fauoured, beſtiall and blinde.

Shame lowrd, repentance ſighed, reproach did ſcold:

Reproach ſharpe, repentance whips entwinde,

Shame burning Taper in her hand did hold,

All three to each vnlike, yet all made in one mould.

Idem.

* —Stearne ſtrife and anger ſtout,

Vnquiet care, and ſad vnthriftie head:

Lewd loſſe of time, and ſorrow being dead,

Vile pouertie, and laſtly death with Infamie.

Cold poyſoning Poppey, itching, drowſie, ſad.

The ſtifning Carpeſe, th'eyes-foe Hemlock ſtinking,

Limb-numming, belching: and the ſinew ſhrinking.

Dead-laughing Apium, weeping Aconite.

Roote, barke, and fruite, and yet much more the teares.

There liues the ſea-oake in a litle ſhell,

There growes vntild the ruddy Cochenell,

And there the Chermez, which on each ſide armes

With pointed prickles all his precious armes,

Rich trees and fruitfull in theſe wormes of price,

Which preſſed, yeeld a crimſon coloured iuice,

When thouſand lambs are died ſo deepe in graine,

That their owne mothers know them not againe,

There mounts the Melt which ſerues in Mexico,

For weapon, wood, needle and thred to ſowe,

Bricke, honey, ſugar, ſucket, balme, and wine,

Parchment, perfume, apparell, cord, and line,

His wood for fier, his harder leaues are fit,

For thouſand vſes of inuentiue wit.

I. Syluester.

The pedant miniſter, and ſeruing clarke,

The ten pound baſe, frize ierkin hireling,

All reuerend titles into deadly hate

Their godly calling, and their hie eſtate.

Th. Storer.

Sure bond of Cities friendſhips maſticke ſweete,

Strong curbe of anger yerſt vnited, now

In thouſand drie brookes ſtraies, I wot not how:

That rare rich gold, that charme griefe, fancie mouer [...]

That calm-rage, harts theefe, quel-pride coniure-louer,

That pureſt coine then currant in each coaſt

Now mingled, hath ſound, waight, and colour loſt.

Tis counterfeit, and ouer euery ſhoare,

The confuſd fall of Babell yet doth roare.

Of God himſelfe, th'old ſacred Idiome rich,

Right perfect language, wher's no point nor ſigne.

But hides ſome rare deepe miſterie behind.

Idem.

The learned's ſunne, who eloquently can

Speake Hebrew, Greeke, French, Latine, Nubian,

Mother and miſtreſſe of all the tongues the prime,

Which pure haſt paſt ſuch vaſt deepe gulphs of time,

Which haſt no word but waies, whoſe elements

Flowe with hid ſenſe, thy points with ſacraments.

O ſacred Dialect, in thee the names

Of men, townes, countries, regiſter their fames

In briefe abridgements: and the names of birds,

Of water gueſts, and forreſt haunting heards,

Are open brookes, where euery man might read.

### 1.327. Miſcellanea. Of the Graces. * Acidale.

— The Graces daughters of delight,

Handmaides of Ʋenus, which are wont to haunt

* Vpon this hill, and daunce there day and night,

Thoſe three to men all gifts of graces graunt,

And all that Ʋenus in her ſelfe doth vaunt,

Is borrowed of them.

Ed. Sp.

They are the daughters of skie-ruling Ioue,

By him begot of faire Eurynome,

The Oceans daughter in this pleaſant Groue,

As he this way comming from feaſtfull glee

[[Page 497]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=256)Of Thetis
wedding with Aeacidee,

In ſommers ſhade himſelfe here reſted weary.

The firſt of them hight mild Euphroſyne,

Next faire Aglaia, laſt Thalia merry,

Sweet goddeſſes al three, which men in mirth do cherry

Therfore they alwaies ſmoothly ſeemd to ſmile,

That we likewiſe ſhould mild and gentle bee,

And alſo naked are, that without guile

Or falſe diſſemblance all them plaine may ſee,

Simple and true, from couert malice free:

And eke themſelues ſo in their daunce they bore,

That two of them ſtil forward ſeemd to bee.

But one ſtil forwards ſhou'd her ſelfe afore,

That good ſhould from vs go, then come in greater ſtore.

Idem.

### 1.328. Simoniake and vnlearned Miniſters.

Such men are like our curtaines at their beſt,

To make vs ſleepe, or hinder vs from light:

Troublers of nature, children of the Weſt,

Haters of ſence, adopted ſonnes of night,

In whom the wiſe both ſorrow and delight.

Yet were there not ſuch Vegetalls the while,

What had the wiſer ſort whereat to ſmile?

Th. Storer.

Renowmed Picus of Mirandula,

Hated the ſubſtance of a Clergy man

That was vnlettered, and made a lawe,

An ignorant which neuer had began

[[Page 498]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=257)To ſeeke,
or after ſeeking neuer ſcan.

Some part of ſomewhat that might wiſedome bring,

Should be accounted but a liuing thing.

Idem.

The noble Tichobraghe for whoſe deare ſake

All Denmarke is in admirations loue:

In deepe regard ſuch difference doth make

Betweene thoſe men whoſe ſpirits ſoare aboue,

And thoſe baſe eſſents which only moue.

That in his Iles Horizon he admits

No cloudy Meteors of ſuch foggy wits.

Idem.

### 1.329. Of Beaſts.

The multitude to Ioue a ſute imparts,

With neighing, blaying, braying, and barking,

Roring and howling, for to haue a king.

A king in language theirs they ſaid they would,

(For then their language was a perfect ſpeech)

The Byrds likewiſe which chirpes and puing could,

Cackling and chattering, that of Ioue beſeech,

Only the Owle ſtill warnd them not to ſeech.

So haſtily, that, which they would repent,

But ſaw they would, and he to deſarts went.

Ioue wiſely ſaid (for wiſedome wiſely ſaies)

O Beaſts take heed what you of me deſire,

Rulers will thinke all things made them to pleaſe,

And ſoone forget the ſwinke due to their hire,

[[Page 499]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=257)But ſince
you will part of my heauenly fire,

I will you lend, the reſt your ſelues muſt giue,

That it both ſeene and felt may with you liue.

Full glad they were, and tooke the naked ſprite

Which ſtrait the earth ycloathed in his clay:

The Lyon hart; the Ownce gaue actiue might.

The Horſe good ſhape; the Sparrow luſt to play,

Nightingale voyce, entiſing ſongs to ſay.

Elephant gaue a perfect memory,

And Parrot ready toong that to apply.

The Foxe gaue craft; the Dogge gaue flattery,

Aſſe patience; the Mole a working thought:

[...]agle high thought, Wolfe ſecret crueltie,

Monky ſweet breath; the Cow her faire eyes brought

The Ermion whiteſt skin, ſpotted with nought.

The Sheepe mild ſeeming face, climing the Beare,

The Stag did giue the harme-eſchuing feare.

The Hare her ſleights, the Cat his melancholy,

[...]nt induſtry, and Conny skill to build:

[...]anes order; Storkes to be appearing holy.

[...]amelion eaſe to chaunge, Ducke eaſe to yeeld,

[...]rocodile teares, which might be falſly ſpild.

Ape greeting gaue, though he did mowing ſtand,

The inſtrument of inſtruments the hand.

S. Phil. Sidney.

### 1.330. Preparations for defence.

[...]me built the breaches of their broken towne,

[...]hat heauen and Panimire had broken downe.

[...]me other found a Cautell gainſt the Ramme,

[[Page 500]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=258)To ſaue
the wall vnbroken where it came.

Thus Iacobs townes on all ſides had their flankes

With Gabions ſtrong, with bulwarkes and with bankes.

Some others buſie went and came in routs,

To Terrace Towers, ſome vnder baskets louts.

Some others alſo wanting time and might

To ſtrength their Townes, yet vſed all kind of ſlight

To dig vp ditches deepe for Ceſternes good,

To draw to them the beſt and neareſt flood.

Th. Hudſon.

* —The hidden loue that now adayes doth hold,

The ſteele and load-ſtone, Hydrargire and gold.

The Amber and ſtraw; that lodgeth in one ſhell,

Pearle-fiſh and Sharpling: and vnites ſo well

Sargons and Goates, the Sperage and the Roſe,

Th'Elme and the Vine, th'Oliue and Mirtle buſh

Is but a ſparke or ſhadow of that loue,

Which at the firſt in euery thing did moue.

When as the earths Muſes with harmonious ſound,

To heauens ſweet muſicke humbly did reſound.

But Adam being chiefe of all the ſtrings

Of this large Lute, ore-retched, quickly brings

All out of tune: and now for melody

Of warbling charmes, it yells ſo hideouſly

That it affrights fell Enynon, who turmoiles

To raiſe againe th'old Chaos anticke broiles.

I. Syl.

* —Holy Nectar that in heauenly bowers

Eternally ſelfe-powring Hebe powers.

Or bleſt Ambroſia, Gods immortal fare.

Idem.

[[Page 501]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=258)

* O who ſhall ſhow the countenance and geſtures

Of mercy and iuſtice? which faire ſacred ſiſters

With equal poize do euer ballance euen,

Th'vnchanging proiects of the king of heauen.

Th'one ſterne of looke, the other mild aſpecting,

Th'one pleaſd with teares, th'other blood affecting.

Th'one beares the ſword of vengeance vnrelenting,

Th'other kings pardon, for the true repenting.

The one earths Eden, Adam did diſmiſſe,

Th'other hath raiſde him to a higher bliſſe.

Idem.

* Day hath his golden Sun, her Moone the night,

Her fixt and wandring ſtarres, the azure skie:

So framed all by their Creators might,

That ſtil they liue and ſhine, and nere ſhall die.

Till in a moment with the laſt dayes brand

They burne, and with them, burne earth, ſea and land.

Ed. Fairfax.

—The Wolfe the trembling ſheepe purſues,

The crowing Cocke the Lyon ſtout eſchues.

The Pullaine hide them from the Puttocks flight,

The Maſties mute at the Hyaenas ſight.

Yea, who would thinke of this fel enmities?

Rage in the ſenceleſſe trunks of plants and trees.

The Vine, the Cole, the Colewort Sow bread dreeds,

The Fearne abhorres the hollow wauing Reeds.

The Oliue and the Oake participate,

Euen to their earth, ſignes of their auncient hate.

Which ſuffers not (ô date leſſe diſcord) th'one

Liue in that ground, where th'other firſt hath growne.

I. Syl.

[[Page 502]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=259)

So at the ſound of Wolfe-drums ratling thunder,

Th'affrighted ſheep-skin drum doth rent in ſunder.

So that fell monſters twiſted entraile cuts

By ſecret power the poore Lambes twined guts.

Which after death in ſtead of bleating mute,

Are taught to ſpeake vpon an Iuory Lute.

And ſo the princely Eagles rauening plumes,

The feathers of all other fowle conſumes.

Idem.

* —There the tree from of whoſe trembling top,

Both ſwimming Shoales and flying troupes do drop.

I meane the tree now in Iuturna growing,

Whoſe leaues diſpearſt by Zephyrs wanton blowing,

Are metamorphos'd both in forme and matter,

On land to fowles, to fiſhes on the water.

Idem.

* —The Partrich new hatched beares

On her weake backe, her parents houſe, and weares

In ſtead of wings, a beuer rupple downe

Followes her damme, through furrows vp and downe▪

Idem.

* —We ſee the new falne ſilly Lambe

Yet ſtaind with blood of his diſtreſſed damme,

Knowes well the Wolfe, at whoſe fell ſight he ſhakes,

And right the teate of th'vnknowne Eawe he takes.

Idem.

### 1.331. Furies.

Alecto, ſad Megera, and Theſiphon,

The nights blacke ſaunghters grim-fac'd Furies ſad.

[[Page 503]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=259)Sterne
Plutoes poſts.

I. Sylueſter.

### 1.332. Nepenthe.

Nepenthe is a drinke of ſoueraigne grace,

Deuiſed of the Gods for to aſſage

Hearts griefe, and bitter gall away to chaſe,

Which ſtirre vp anguiſh and contentious rage,

In ſtead thereof, ſweete peace and quiet age,

It doth eſtabliſh in the troubled minde

Fewe men but ſuch as ſober are and ſage,

Are by the Gods to drinke thereof aſſignde,

But ſuch as drinke, eternall happineſſe do finde.

Ed. Sp.

—Nepenthe enemie to ſadneſſe,

Repelling ſorrowes, and repeating gladneſſe.

Elyxer that excells,

Saue men or angells, euery creature ells.

I. Syl.

### 1.333. Of Eccho.

Th'aires daughter Eccho haunting woods among,

A blab that will not (cannot keepe her tongue)

Who neuer askes, but euer anſweres all,

Who lets not any her in vaine to call.

Idem.

### 1.334. Of the Marigold.

The Marigold ſo likes the louely Sunne,

That wh [...]n he ſets, the other hides his face:

[[Page 504]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=260)And when
he gins his morning courſe to runne,

She ſpreads abroad, and ſhewes her greateſt grace.

T. Watſon.

### 1.335. Of the Eagle.

No bird but Ioues can looke againſt the ſunne.

W. Warner.

### 1.337. Nylus.

Great Nilus land, where raine doth neuer fall.

T. Hudſon.

There quakes the plant, which in Pudefetan

Is call'd the ſhamefac't, for aſham'd of man,

If toward it one do approach too much,

It ſhrinkes the boughes, to ſhun our hatefull touch.

As if it had a ſoule, a ſenſe, and ſight,

Subiect to ſhame, feare, ſorow and deſpight.

I. Syluester.

### 1.338. Of Acheron.

Rude Acheron, a loathſome lake to hell,

That boiles and bubs vp ſwelth as blacke as hell.

[[Page 505]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=260)Where
griſly Charon at their fixed tide

Still ferries ghoſts vnto the farther ſide.

M. Sackuile.

### 1.339. Echidna.

Echidna is a monſter direfull dread,

Whom Gods do hate and heauens abhorre to ſee:

So hidious is her ſhape, ſo huge her head,

That euen the helliſh fiends affrighted bee

At ſight thereof, and from her preſence flie.

Yet did her faire and former parts profeſſe,

A faire young maiden, full of comely glee:

But all her hinder parts did plaine expreſſe,

A monſtrous Dragon, full of fearefull vglineſſe.

Ed. Spencer.

### 1.340. 4. Cardinall vertues.

Andronica that wiſely ſees before,

And Phroneſis the Iudge, and chaſte Drucilla,

And ſhe that boldly fights for vertues lore,

Deſcending from the Romine race Camilla.

S. I. Harrington.

### 1.341. Of the Eagle.

The Cedar-building Eagle beares the winde,

And not the Falchon, though both Haukes by kinde.

That Kingly bird doth from the clouds command

The fearefull fowle that moues but nere the land.

M. Dray.

### 1.342. Phoenix.

—The bird of fame

That ſtill renewes it ſelfe and neuer dies,

And onely one in all the world there flies.

S. I. Harrington.

* Of all chaſt birds the Phaenix doth excell,

Of all ſtrong beaſts the Lyon beares the bell:

Of all ſweete flowers, the Roſe doth ſweeteſt ſmell.

Of all pure mettalls gold is onely pureſt,

Of all the trees the Pine hath higheſt creſt.

Of all proud birds the Eagle pleaſeth Ioue,

Of pretie fowles kind Venus likes the Doue,

Of trees Minerua doth the Oliue moue.

T. Lodge.

* Who holdeth league with Neptune and the winde?

S. Dan.

The Phaenix gazeth on the ſunnes bright beames,

The Echinaeus ſwims againſt the ſtreames.

R. Greene.

### 1.343. Impoſsibilities.

He that the number of the leaues could caſt,

That in Nouember falles by winters blaſt:

He that could tell the drops of raine and ſleete,

That Hyad, Orion, or Pleyiades weete.

Sheds on the ground that man might onely tell,

What teares from Iudiths eies inceſtant fell.

Th. Hudſon.

[[Page 507]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=262)

— Like Coruiue who forgate

His Proper name; or like George Trapezunce,

Learned in youth, and in his age a dunce.

I. Syl.

The firmament ſhall retrograde his courſe,

Swift Euphrates go hide him in his ſourſe:

Firme mountains skip like lambes beneath the deepe,

Eagles ſhall diue, whales in the aire ſhall keepe.

Ere I preſume with fingers end to touch,

Much leſſe with lippes the fruite forbid too much.

I. Sylueſter.

Flie from thy channell, Thames forſake thy ſtreames,

Leaue the Adamant Iron, Phoebus lay thy beames.

Ceaſe heauenly ſpheres, at laſt your watrie warke

Betray your charge, returne to Chaos darke.

At leaſt ſome ruthleſſe Tigre hang her whelpe,

My Catisbye ſo with ſome excuſe to helpe,

M. M.

### 1.344. Ceston.

That girdle gaue the vertue of chaſt loue,

And wiuehood true to all that did it beare:

But whoſoeuer contrary doth proue,

Might not the ſame about her middle weare,

But it would looſe or elſe aſunder teare,

Whilom it was (as Faieries wont report)

Dame Venus girdle by her eſteemd deare

What time ſhe vſde to liue in wiuely ſort.

But laid aſide when ſo ſhe vſde her ſport.

Her husband Vulcan whilome for her ſake,

When firſt he loued her with heart intire,

This precious ornament they ſay did make.

And wrought in Lemnos with vnquenched fire,

And afterward did for her firſt loues hire,

[[Page 508]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=263)Giue it to
her for euer to remaine,

Therewith to bind laſciuious deſire,

And looſe affections ſtraightly to reſtraine,

Which vertue it for euer did retaine.

This goodly Belt, was Ceſton call'd by name.

Ed. Spencer.

* The noble Lyon neuer ſlaies the leaſt,

But alwaies praies vpon ſome worthy beaſt.

The thunder throwes his ſulphured ſhafts adowne,

On Atlas high, or cold Riphins crowne.

The tempeſt fell more feruently doth fall

On houſes high, then on the homely hall.

Th. Hudſon.

*Saturn taught men vntaught before, to eare the luſty land,

And how to pierce the pathleſſe aire with ſhafts from bow­mans hand.

God Dis did quaile to ſee his gold ſo faſt conuaid from hell,

And fiſhes quakt, when men in ſhips amidſt their flouds did dwell.

Ʋ Ʋ. Ʋ Ʋarner.

### 1.345. Twelue foule faults.

A wiſe man liuing like a drone, an old man not deuout,

Youth diſobedient, rich men that are charitie without:

A ſhameles womā, vicious Lords, a poore man proudly ſtout.

Cōtentious Chriſtiās, Paſtors, that their functiōs do neglect,

A wicked King, no diſcipline, no lawes men to direct,

Are twelue the fouleſt faults that moſt all common-wealths infect.

W. Warner.

[[Page 509]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=263)

### 1.346. Engines of warre.

—The Inginers haue the Trepan dreſt,

And reared vp the Ramme for battery beſt.

Here bends the Briccoll while the Cable crackes,

There Crosbowes were vprent with yron Rackes.

Here crooked Coruies fleing Bridges tall,

Their ſcathfull Scorpions that ruines the wall,

On euery ſide they raiſe with ioynture meete,

The timber Towres for to commaund the ſtreete.

The painfull Pioners wrought againſt their will,

With fleakes and Faggots, ditches vp to fill.

Th. Hudſon.

* —The happie Arabs thoſe that builds

In thatched Wagons wandring through the fields.

The ſubtil Tirians they who firſt were Clarkes,

That ſtaid the wandring words in leaues and barkes.

Idem.

* At Babell firſt confuſed toongs of euery language grew.

W. Warner.

—Idolatry did growe

* From Ninus firſt, he firſt a Monarchy did frame.

Idem.

*Lord Dane the ſame was called thē, to thē a pleaſing name,

Now odiouſly Lordan ſay we, when idle mates we blame.

Idem.

* The Turtle that is true and chaſte in loue,

Shewes by her mate ſomething the ſpirit doth moue.

The Arabian byrd that neuer is but one,

Is only chaſte becauſe ſhe is alone.

[[Page 494]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=203&page=264)But had
our mother Nature made them two,

They would haue done as Doues and Sparrowes do.

But therefore made a Martyr in deſire,

And doth her pennance laſtly in the fire.

M. Drayton.

*I caſt not with fooles, ſuffer Saints, let mighty fooles be mad,

Note, Seneca by newes done for precepts, pennance had.

VV. Warner.

* The Romane widow dide when ſhe beheld

Her ſonne, whom erſt ſhe counted ſlaine in feeld.

G. Gaſcoigne.

### 1.347. Riuers.

Faire Danubie is praiſde for being wide,

Nilus commended for the ſeuen-fold head:

Euphrates for the ſwiftneſſe of the tide,

And for the garden whence his courſe is led,

The bankes of Rhine with Vines are ouerſpred.

Take Loyre and Po, yet all may not compare

With Engliſh Thameſis for buildings rare.

Th. Storer.

FINIS.

FAmes windy trump blew up this haughty mind

To do or wiſh, to do what here you find:

Twas ne're held error yet in errant Knights

(Which priviledge he claims) to dreſs their fights

In high hyperbolies: for youths example,

To make their minds, as they grow men, grow ample.

Thus ſuch atchievements are aſſaid and done

As paſs the common power and ſence of man.

Then let high ſpirits ſtrive to imitate,

Not what he did, but what he doth relate.
