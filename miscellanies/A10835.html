And surely fervent zeale in Gods cause is a temper wel befitting Gods servants: neyther is there any more bastardly disposition to be found in a Christian, then indifferency in religion. It makes no matter of what religion the man is that is indifferent in it: <span class="hi">for Christ vvill spue out of his mouth</span> (as loathsome) <span class="hi">the luke­vvarm,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note9">Rev. 3. 16.</span> whether wine, or water.</p><p>Yet as the case of religion is most weighty, so is the affection of zeale in it most dangerous, if it be eyther pretended onely, &amp; not in truth; or preposterous and not according to knowledge.</p><p>And therefore as there is singular vse of this fyery zeal for these frozen times of ours, so are we to take great heed that our fyre be kindled at the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note10">Levit. 9. 24. 1 King. 18. 38.</span> <span class="hi">fyre of the altar vvhich came from heavē.</span> For as Luke.

Such a stormy nature, with a very litle zeal amongst, may make a great stir in the world, but is iustly to be suspected. And that especially (which is the 2. caution) in such men, as are suddaynly<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note13">II.</span> caryed, and as it were transformed from one contrary to another without eyther competent tyme or means. A suspitious course; for all thing ordinarily whither in grace, or nature, are wrought by degrees, and the passage from one extreme to another without due means, as it can hardly be sound, so can it not possibly be vn­suspected. Now ther are many men to be found which are vi­olent in all things but constant in none. And though all things <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e296"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=3">[Page 5]</a></span> be with thē as the figs in Ieremyes <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note14">Ier. 24. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 2. 3. two baskets</span> <span class="hi">tvvo baskets, the good very good and the evill very evill,</span> yet are they ever shifting hands out of the one basket into the other. Today they will lift vp and advance a cause and person to heaven, and to morrow they will throw downe both it and him to the lowest hell. It is good to have such men in a godly iealousy, and there zeale with them. And that chiefly (which I desyre may be observed in the third<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note15">III.</span> place) when this theyr zeale rises and falls as the tymes serve. Al­most all men will at tymes manifest zeal, but the most have this gift withall, that they wilbe sure to take the strongest syde, or that part at least, which hath some hope of prevayling. And so whylst there remaynes hope of bearing things over at the breast, they are very forward and fervent in there courses; but when that hope shaketh, theyr edg is of, and they turne theyr backs shame­fully vpon the truth, yea and oft tymes theyr faces agaynst it.</p><p>And herevpon it comes to passe that many (formerly great advauncers of the cause of reformation) have of late tymes not onely fouly forsaken, but violently opposed the same both in us and them also amongst themselves, which doe in any measure desyer it, publishing theyr books vnto the world so filled with empty words and swelling vanityes, as they not onely bewray the weaknes of theyr cause, but the evill and corrupt disposition of theyr hearts, as rather striving to manifest theyr servil<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> affections for insinuations into the favours of the myghty; then to bring any thing of weight for the conviction of the adversary. The application of this I leave to the godly and wise reader, as he shall see iust cause.</p><p>And so leaving those things which are more generall, I desyre in particular, and for the present purpose that the christian reader take knowledg of this one thing, that as the pretence of zeale in the forward Ministers against all corruptions is as a thick mist, holding the eyes of many wel mynded from seing the truth; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e328"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=4">[Page 6]</a></span> so the person with whom I now particularly deal, trusts to this insinuation above all others, conveyghing himself vnder this co­lour into the harts of the simple, and hereby making way most ef­fectually, not onely for his sage-seeming <span class="hi">counsels</span> &amp; <span class="hi">advertise­ments,</span> for the quenching of their affections towards the truth: but also for his idle guesses and <span class="hi">likelyhoods,</span> with such perso­nall comparisons, and imputations, as wherewith his book is sto­red, to alienate mens harts from it.</p><p>But the godly reader is to consider that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note16">Prov. 24. 23.</span> <span class="hi">to accept the person in judgement is not good,</span> especially in the cause of the Lord, and that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note17"><span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>m. 2. 1.</span> <span class="hi">the faith of our glorious Lord Iesus is not to be held in respect of persons:</span> but that the naked and simple truth is to be inquired after, with an vnpartiall affection.

Such persons are cōmonly called amongst themselves professors, vertuous and religious, &amp; thereby distinguished fro the body of the land, which make no such profession, and are therefore accounted (and iustly) prophane, and without religion, and that as roundly by Mr. B. as by any other in the Land. But it seemeth he had forgot both his Epistle &amp; whom both he in it, and others every where, call Professors for distinction sake, when he wrote his book; for in it <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note21">Pag. 112. 113.</span> he makes all the kingdome profes­sors at a venture, and Christian professours I hope he meaneth.</p><p>Thus those whom he severeth in the Epistle, he confounds in the book. And let him wel consider how he can quit himself eyther from flatterie in the one, or from vntruth in the other.</p><p>And where (Mr Ber.) in the body of the Epistle, you seat your self in the middest between <span class="hi">the schismatical Brownist</span> (as you charitably term him) &amp; <span class="hi">the Antichristiā Papist, the one snatching on the right hād, and the other on the left,</span> it is something which you say, and more belike then you are aware of.</p><p>Fitly may you be seated in the middest betwixt both, being indeed a min­glement &amp; compound of both, and wel may both snatch at you, and yet nei­ther do you wrong, if neyther require more then their owne. Iustly may the Papists challenge from you that stinted service book, devised Ministerie, An­tichristian Hierarchie, and Babylonish confusion which you have stollen away from them, as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note22">Gen. 31. 19. 34.</span> Rahel did her Fathers idols though she covered them never so close. And iustly also may we chalenge from you such godly people as you fraudulently deteyn, and such truthes of doctrine as you teach, as being the peculiars of the true Church: as the holy vessels were of the temple <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note23">Ier. 52. 17▪ 18.</span> though violently with the people caried to Babylon and there kept.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e472"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=5">[Page 8]</a></span>But if you will still hault betwixt both, as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note24">1 King. 18 21.</span> Israell did betwixt God and Baal, and carry in your right hand many Evangelicall truthes with vs, &amp; in your left many Antichristian devises with the Papists, no marvell though both partyes remayne vnsatisfyed; neyther must you be offended, though the Papists for the truthes you hold with vs account you hereticks, nor though we for the devises you reteyn with them call you Antichristian. And so you see your midle standing betwixt them and vs more wayes then one.</p><p>And thus much of the Epistle dedicatory. In the next place I come to the preface: where amongst other iust complaynts of the iniquityes of the tymes, you reckon (and that worthily) as the most daungerous <span class="hi">Atheisticall securi­ty &amp; carnall living vnder a generall profession,</span> to which purpose you alledg 2 Tim. 3. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and so instance in <span class="hi">your English people:</span> This place of Timothy alone had you well weyed, and throughly improved especially the fifth verse, where separation from such persons (as having a shew of godlines do deny the power thereof, as you confesse the English people do) is expresly commaunded, it would eyther have stopped your mouth from reproch­ing vs as you do for separation, or els have opened the mouth of the most sim­ple reader to reproue your vanity, as God did the mouth of the asse to reprove Balaam.</p><p>The next thing I observe is how vauntingly you bring as chalengers into the lists Mr. Gyshop, Mr Bradshaw, D. Allison and other vn-named Ministers, all which you say are vnanswered by vs. And no marveil, for sundry of their writings never came to our hands, and besides it were a more equall and compendious way for these men to take vp the defence of their Churches cause, where their fellowes have forsaken it, and left it desolate, then thus to make new chalenges, though in truth with the same weapons (it may be new frubbished over) wherewith the other have lost the field. Yet are theyr books and (by the grace of God assisting) shalbe answered in particu­lar as they come to our hands, and are thought worthy answering: though in truth it were no hard thing for our adversaries to oppresse us with the multi­tude of books considering both how few and how feeble we are in comparison (besides other outward difficultyes) if the truth we hold which is stronger then all, did not support it selfe.</p><p>The difference you lay down in the next place touching the proper sub­ject of the power of Christ is true in it selfe being rightly vnderstood, and onely yours wherein it is corruptly related, and specially in the particular concer­ning <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e503"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=5">[Page 9]</a></span> vs, as, that where <span class="hi">the Papists plant the ruling power of Christ in the Pope; the Protestāts in the Byshops; the Puritants,</span> as you terme the reformed Churches &amp; those of theyr mynde <span class="hi">in the Presbytery;</span> we (whome you name <span class="hi">Brownists</span>) put it in the <span class="hi">body of the Cōgregatiō, the multi­tude called the Church:</span> odiously insinuating against us that we do exclude the Elders in the case of goverment, where on the contrary we professe the By­shops or Elders, to be the onely ordinary governours in the Church, as in all o­ther actions of the Churches communion, so also in the censures. Onely we may not acknowledge them for <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note25">1 Pet. 5 3</span> <span class="hi">Lords over Gods heritage,</span> as you would make them, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note26">pag. 10 1.</span> controuling all, but to be controuled by none; much lesse essen­tiall vnto the Church, as though it could not be without them; least of all the Church it self, as you and others expound Math. 18: But we hold the Elder­ship, as other ordinances given vnto the Church for her service, and so the El­ders or officers <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note27">2 Cor. 4. 5 Col. 1. 25.</span> the servants and ministers of the Church the wife, vnder Christ her husband, a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> the scriptures expresly affirm. Of which more here­after.</p><p>And where further you advise the reader to <span class="hi">take from the Iay other birds feathers,</span> that is, as you expound your self, <span class="hi">to set vs before him as we differ from all other Churches.</span> Therein you make a most inconsi­derate and vnreasonable motion.</p><p>If a man should set the Church of England before his eyes, as it differeth but from the reformed Churches, it would be no very beautiful bird. Yea what could it in that colour afforde, but Egyptian bondage; Babylonish confusion; carnal pomp; and a company of Iewish; Heathenish, and Popish ceremonies? Whatsoever truth is in the world it is from God, and from him we have it, by what hand soever it be reached vnto vs <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note28">1 Cor. 14. 36.</span> <span class="hi">Came the word of God un­to you onely?</span> &amp; vnto it we have good right as the Israel of God, unto whom he hath committed his oracles. Rom. 3. 2.</p><p>Towards the end of the Preface you do render two reasons vpon which you do adventure to deal against vs as you do, the one <span class="hi">cōfidence in your cause,</span> the other <span class="hi">the spirituall injury which some of late have done you, in taking away part of the seale of the Ministery.</span> Touching the first: as it is to vs that know you wel, no new thing to see you confident in all enter­prises; so doth it much behoove you to consider, how long and by what meanes you have been possessed of this your confident perswasion. I could name the person of good credite and note, to whom vpon occasion you confessed (and that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e593"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=6">[Page 10]</a></span> since you spake the same things, which here you write as confidently as now you write them) that you had much a doe to keep a good conscience in dealing against this cause, as you did.</p><p>But a speach of your own vttered to my self (ever to be remēbred with fear and trembling) can not I forget, when after the conference passing betwixt Mr H. and me, you vttered these wordes, <span class="hi">Wel, I wil returne home, &amp; preach as I have done, and I must say as Naaman did, the Lord be merciful unto me in this thing:</span> and therevpon you further promised with out any provocation by me or any other, that <span class="hi">you would never deale a­gainst this cause, nor with-hold any frōit:</span> though the very next Lords day, or next but one, you taught publikli<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> against it, and so broke your v<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>w, the Lord graunt, not you conscience.</p><p>And for the seale of your Ministerie, deceive not yourself and others; if you had not a more authentick seal in your black box to shew for your Mi­nistery at your Bishops visitation, then the converting of men to God, (which is the seal you meane,) this seale would stand you in as little stead, as it doth many others which can shew as <span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>re this way as you, and yet are put from their Ministerie notwithstanding. And wil you charge your Bishops &amp; Church representative to deale so trecherously with the Lord, as to put downe his Ministers and Officers which have his broad seal to shew for their Office and Ministerie? What greater contumely do these <span class="hi">vipers,</span> these <span class="hi">schisma­ticall Brownists</span> lay vpon your Church then you doe herein.</p><p>The Church of England acknowledgeth no such seale as this is. The Bishops ordination and license, conformitie vnto their ceremonies, subscripti­on to their articles, devout singing and saying their service-book is that which will beare a man out though he be far enough eyther from converting, or from preaching conversion vnto any.</p><p>And here I desire the reader to observe this one thing with me. When the ministers are called in quaestion by the Bishops, they alledge vnto them their former subscription conformity in some measure, at least their peaceable cariage in their places, but when they would iustify their ministerie against vs, then their vsuall plea is, they haue converted men to God, herein acknowledging (to let passe their vnsound dealing) that we respect the work of Gods grace in any, at which they know the Bishops and their substitutes, if they should plead the same with them, would make a mock for the most part.</p><p>I do most freely acknowledge the singular blessing of God vpon many truthes taught by many in the Land, and do and alwayes shal so far honour those persons as the Lord hath honoured them herein. But that the simple <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e643"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=6">[Page 11]</a></span> conversion of sinners, (yea though the most perfect that ever was wrought) should argue a true office of Ministerie; the scriptures no where teach; ney­ther shall I ever beleeve without them.</p><p>This scripture 1 Cor. 9. 1. 2. is most frequently alledged for this purpose. But as vnsoundly as commonly. For if simple conversion should argue an A­postleship, then should a common effect argue a proper cause, an ordinarie work, an extraordinarie office: for the conversion of men is a work common to extra­ordinarie and to ordinarie officers, yea to true and false officers, yea to such as are in no office at all, as hereafter shall appeare.</p><p>And what could be more weakly alledged by Paul to prove himself no or­dinarie but an extraordinary officer, an Apostle, (which was the thing he intended) then that which is common to ordinary officers with him? Might not the Corinthians easily have replyed! Nay Paul it followes not that you are an Apostle immediately called and sent by Christ, because you haue begotten vs to the Lord, &amp; have been the instrument of our cōversiō, for ordinary Mi­nisters Pastors &amp; Teachers called by men, do beget to the Lord as wel as you.</p><p>The bare conversion of the Corinthians then is not the seal Paul speakes of, but together with it their establishment into a true visible Church, and that with such power and authority Apostolicall, as wherewith Paul was furnished by the Lord. Of which more hereafter.</p><p>But <span class="hi">the father of these childrē</span> (you say) <span class="hi">you are which thus vnna­turally fly from you, and whereof we so injuriously have deprived you,</span> in which respect also you make this your <span class="hi">hue &amp; cry</span> after vs and them, for <span class="hi">through the gospel you have begotten them.</span></p><p>And have you begotten them vnto the faith, as Paul did the Corinthians? and are you their father, as Paul was the father of the Corinthians? then it must needs follow that before you preached the gospel vnto them, and thereby begot them to the Lord, they were in the same estate wherein the Corinthians were before Paul preached vnto them, that is unbeleevers, and without faith, and so were to be reputed. And how then true matter of the Church, for which you so much contend?</p><p>Besides, these your begotten children were baptised long before you saw their faces, some twenty, some thirtie, some fourtie yeares. Now this their baptisme was true baptisme, and so the true seale of their forgivenes of sinnes, and new birth as you affirm &amp; prove, page 119. &amp; this their seal of the new birth hath stood good vpō them all this while visibly and externally, and yet after all this you preach vnto them &amp; beget thē a new visibly &amp; externally (for onely God knoweth that which is true within.) You have begot them through the Gospel.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e699"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=7">[Page 12]</a></span>Behold a minstrous generation, a man begetting children twentie, or thir­tie, or fourtie yeares after they be borne.

The Papists presse the protestants with the peace of the Church and for the rent which they have made in it, condemn them beyond the heathenish souldiours, which forbare to devide Christs garment; as deeply do the Bishops charge the Ministers refusing conformity and subscription, and both of them vs. But the godly wise must not be affrighted eyther from seek­ing or embracing the truth with such buggs as these are, but see­ing<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note32">Iam. 3. 17.</span> <span class="hi">the wisdome which is from above, is first pure, then peaceable,</span> he must make it a great part of his Christian wisdome to discerne betwixt godly and gratious peace, and that which is eyther pretended for advantage, or mistaken by error, &amp; so to labor to hold peace in pu­rity.

The scriptures are these. <span class="hi">Rom. 15. 17. 18. Act. 10. 34. 35.

Where­in more, or els, hath a christian heart cause of reioycing then in the death of Christ? And yet what can be imagined more abominable then the meanes and instruments of working it.</p><p>But to speak nearer Mr B. purpose.

(knowing as he doth) would be loath to have communion in the Iesuits Ministery. More particularly. The Apostle Rom. 15. 17 18. in commendation of his Apostleship layes downe the effects of it and how great cause of reioycing he had, that God by his ministery had planted the Churches of the Gentiles whom he fur­ther describes by theyr obedience in word and deed.</p><p>And how serves this for the Church of England? Thus. It serves first to exclude all those word Saynts for whom Mr B. pleads so much in his book.</p><p>Secondly it serves to shew what small cause there is of reioy­ing for the English Churches being planted of such vniversally &amp; so still continuing as are indeed abhominable and disobedient, &amp; to every good work reprobate.</p><p>The second Scripture is Act. 10. 34. 35. <span class="hi">Of a truth I perceave that God is no accepter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousnes is accepted of him.</span> And is it so?</p><p>What sacrilegious presumption then is it in the Church of En­land to compell God to accept of persons, and to accept for his people &amp; servants such as neither fear him, nor work righteousnes but the cōtrary? to offer vp theyr persons &amp; sacrifices to him in the name of Christ in whome they have no portion? to seale vp the covenant of his grace and peace vnto them in the sacraments with whom it never came into his hart to strike hand, neyther hath he peace with them?</p><p>The third Scripture is Rom. 14. 17. 18. <span class="hi">The kingdome of God is not meat, not drink, but righteousnes, and peace and ioy in the Holy G. for whosoever in those things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, &amp;c.</span></p><p>Hence (to let passe the drift of the Apostle in this place els where opened) thus much must necessarily follow, that where righteous­nes, and peace, and ioy in the Holy Ghost are not, nor men in those things serving Christ, there the kingdome of God is not, nor these men his subiects. And where Gods kingdom is not, there is the kingdome of Satan, and they that are not the subiects of the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4233"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=34">[Page 67]</a></span> one, are the slaves of the other. And so I leave it to the godly rea­der to iudge whither the assemblyes in England gathered at the first, and at this day consisting of such persons for the most part as do not thus nor in these things viz: righteousnes peace and ioy in the Holy Ghost serue Christ, but the contrary, can be rightly &amp; by the word of God accounted the kingdome of God &amp; Church of Christ. Thus the 3. Scriptures which Mr B. stretched out like a threfold coard to hold men in the assemblies, are in truth and in their right meaning as a three stringed whip to scourge those that fear God out of them.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.42"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.42. </span></h3><p><span class="hi">With such a renunciation of the truth must be interteyned much vntruth</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note184">Mr B.</span> (saith Mr Ber.) <span class="hi">as first thou must beleeve their way to be the truth of God, then condemne our Church as a false Church: when themselves have publi­shed that the differences betwixt vs and them are but corruptions.

And thus to set the ordinances of Christ at iarre amongst themselves, and in the commendation of one principall to bury the rest as vile, and vnnecessary, is a most effec­tuall delusion, and deep deceipt, by which the mistery of iniquity is much advantaged in the false assemblyes, and the hearts of the simple fast held in the snares of error, and impiety.</p><p>The Bishops &amp; those of their sect do in their sermons &amp; writings extoll prayer.

This poynt I will further examplify by a symi­litude. A woman free and separated from all other men and ioy­ned in civill covenant to a man, is his wyfe, yea though shee prove very stubborn and disobedient, yea and dishonest also, till the bill of divorcement be given her; but an other woman the wife of an other man, or not contracted to that man, is not his wife, nor can be so reputed, though she be never so obedient &amp; buxome vnto him: so the Church of England til it be separated &amp; free frō the world &amp; prince of the world that rei<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>h in it, &amp; so frō Antichrist his Eldest sonne in his hye<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>archy priesthood &amp; other ordinances, &amp; be taken into covenant with the Lord cānot possibly be the true Ch: of God or wife of Christ: no not though the good things in it were many more then they are.

And this want of the power of the Lord Iesus for reformation, which an o­ther man would think were an intollerable slavery Mr B. pag 68. turnes to good advantage, and thinks himself &amp; his Church halfe excused of all the evils which are amongst them, because they want power to vse the remedy: thus pleading for a priveledg the mark of the beast, frō which the servants of God ought to abhor, herin be­ing passing witty above other men in making an advantage of that evill, which the most have enough to do to excuse.</p><p>And for true Churches not vsing aright the power they have for reformation, they are like true bodyes which through some ob­structions, or stoppings for a time cannot voyd things noxious, &amp; hurtful till there be a remedy: but the Church without this power is as a monstrous body wanting the faculties &amp; instruments of e­vacuation and expulsion of excrements, or other noy some things▪ and therefore is never appointed of God to live, but devoted to death and destruction?</p><p>Of the reformed Churches &amp; our cariage towards them I have spoken els where, and for your Turkish Argument in the margent wherein you incense the Magistrate against vs, as otherwise incor­rigible, it well becomes the rest of your book joyning violence to slaunder.

Or do you not hope to escape persecu­tion your self by persecuting vs? This is too ordinary a practise a­mongst you.

The true Apostolick Churches ha­ving a true constitutiō were gathered &amp; constituted of such men and women as by the preaching of the gospel were made disci­ples, had faith and repentance wrought in them to the obtey­ning of the forgivenes of sinns, &amp; promise of life eternall and to sanctification and obedience.</p><p>Now though my logick be not much better then yours Mr B. yet since my cause is, I will help you with an assumption or 2.

His meaning must be, that profession of faith is required of such persons of yeres before they be admitted into the visible Church. Which truth the place cited by him Act. 8. 12. 37. 38. doth iustify, to which one place many other may be added to the same purpose, as Act. 10. 46. &amp; &amp; 16. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>4, &amp; 18. 8.</p><p>But what is the Church of Worxsop better for this? what profes­sion of faith did the particular members make, when at the first of an Antichristian Synagogue (as in Popery it was), it became or was constituted a true Christian Church? was not the house built at the first as it is at this day repayred?

And the places Mr B. brings forth are so far from iustifying the constitution of the Church of England by the sacraments, as they do most notably evince the prophanation of the sacraments by the Church.</p><p>The two places are Mat. 28. 19. 1 Cor. 10. 16. In the former the Lord Iesus sends his Apostles first to teach, or make men disci­ples, and then to baptise them (including the children in the pa­rents according to the covenant made with Abraham into which the gentiles were in their time to be gathered. <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 11. 17. <span class="hi">Ephe.</span> 2. 1, 2. 13. 14. &amp; 3. 6.) But on the contrary the Lord Bishops in Engl. having found a readier way send out their parrish priests to baptise all before them that are borne in their parishes, whether their pa­rents be taught or vntaught, the disciples of Christ or of antichrist, and the Divil, not passing by the children of recusant Papists &amp; o­thers refusing all communion with them, whose children they use to baptize by force, &amp; against the will of their Parents, as I could prove (if need were) by sundry instances.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6051"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=47">[Page 92]</a></span>And is not here an orderly constitution, and a Church truely ga­thered by the sacrament of baptisme?</p><p>Now 1 Cor. 10. 16. the Apostle teacheth that the bread and wine in the supper are the communion of the body and blood of Christ, that is effectuall pledges of our conjunction, and incorpo­ration with Christ, and one with another: and in the 17. vers. that all which eat of one bread, or one loaf, are one mysticall body. This place alone if Mr B. and his fellow ministers would seriously con­consider and set themselves faithfully to observe they would rather offer their owne bodies to be torn in peices by wilde beasts, then the holy misteries of Christs body to be prophaned, as they are.</p><p>And here as formerly I will help the Arguments raysed from the scriptures produced by Mr B. and some other of the same kinde into form thus.</p><p>The sacrament of baptisme is to be administred by Christs ap­pointment, and the Apostles example onely to such as are (viz externally and so far as men can judge) taught and made disci­ples, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 28. 19. do receive the word gladly, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 2. 41. be­leeve and so professe <span class="hi">Ch.</span> 8. 12. 13. 37. have received the holy Ghost <span class="hi">Ch.</span> 10. 47. and to their seed. <span class="hi">Act.</span> 2. 39. 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 7. 14.</p><p>But baptisme in Engl. is ministred by a far larger commis­sion then Christs: though there be in the parents neyther ap­pearance of faith nor holynes, if in stead of them they can pro­cure godfathers and godmothers to cary the children to the font (yea will they nil they) the parrish priest hath commission to make them Christian soules every mothers childe of them, borne within his parrish precincts. And therefore the bap­tism in Engl. is not Christs baptisme in the administration of it.</p><p>For the Lords supper the Apostle sayth, 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 10. 16. that the bread and wine sanctifyed to that purpose is the communion, that is, an effectuall symbole or pledge of that communion which the receivers have with Christ. Wherevpon I do turne the point of this scripture into the bowels of the Church of Engl. thus.</p><p>That which ioynes such men in communion with Christ as by his expresse word he excludes from all communion with him, that is so far from being the true constitutiō of the Church <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6110"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=47">[Page 93]</a></span> as it shewes both an vnholy confusion in the Church and a vio­lent prophanation of the ordinance by it.</p><p>But the supper as it is ministred in the Parish-assemblies, (as they were at the first, &amp; still are clapt together) ioynes them with Christ with whom he expresly disclaymes all communion &amp; fellowship as their practise compared with these scriptures doth make manifest to all men. 2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 1 Ioh. 1. 6.

Mark, 4. 11, 12, are not to expound playne rules, but to be ex­pounded by them. Which proviso alone being observed might stand in stead of all answer to whatsoever out of these perverted parables could be objected.</p><p>The point is, Mr B. following (I confesse) the most beaten way, makes the field the visible Church, and the tares scandalous offenders, seen and discovered. Wherevpon it must follow, that as the Lord forbids the servants to meddle with the tares, or with the plucking them vp, but will haue them, &amp; the wheat to grow together in the feild till the harvest, so both ministers and people are str<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ytly inhibited and forbidden any way to admonish &amp; cen­sure wicked and scandalous persons in the Church, but must let them there remayne without disturbance, till the last judgement.</p><p>The venemous weeds, the noysome tares, (Idolaters, hereticks, covetous persons, blasphemers and all) whose nature is to over­spread and choak the wheat, must be suffred still to grow with it. And thus at once by this one prophane glosse, all the tex<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s of scri­ptures, and commaundements of Christ, both for admonitions, and excommunications, are vtterly voided and ānihilated. The brethren, nay the ministers themselves may not medle with the tares, the wicked, to admonish or reprove them, they must be let alone; the sword of the Censures so gratiously given to cut of rotten members, must no more now be drawn out, but must rust in the sheath of this expositiō, notwithstanding all the playn scrip­tures to the contrary, <span class="hi">Lev. 19. 17. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Thes. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 14. 1 Tim. 5. 30. &amp; 2 Ep. 4. 2.

Indeed I must needs acknowledge &amp; will not wrōg them, that if they should execute their owne canons, as they have framed them, they should not very oft practise against this expositiō, nor gather the tares frō among the wheat, but the wheat frō amongst the tares. But to proceed. It may be some wil answer, that Christ doth not here absolutely forbid his disciples the vse of the Censures against the wicked, but rather acquaints thē before hād what wilbe the estate of the Ch: &amp; how the wicked wilbe suffred to continue in it vncen­sured. And if this were so it made nothing against me, nor for Mr B: it were the Churches sin so to suffer them, &amp; I deny not but Churches vsually are to negligent &amp; remisse, through want of zeal &amp; faithfulnes to the Lord in this duty. But it is plain the Lord Iesus layes a flat in­hibition against the weeding out of these tares, &amp; expresly cōmaunds to let them alone: &amp; this cōmandemēt also he backes with two sub­stantial reasons, the first <span class="hi">least they pluck vp the wheat with the tares.</span> v. 29: the 2. because the Lord hath appointed another time, <span class="hi">the tyme of the harvest for the plucking them out,</span> v. 30. Now some being ashamed of the grosnes, &amp; in deed of the iniquity of this exposition, would fayne moderate &amp; qualify the matter, by turning it off to these &amp; these sinns, &amp; sinners. Some say that by the tares are meant the ministers onely, &amp; that they are not to be medled with, though they transgresse, least the wheat be plucked vp with thē: as though the Lord would have the persons of men respected in judgement: yea verily there is more need to look to them in such cases, then to any private mēbers whomsoever, as whose sinns are more displeasing vnto God, more scandalous to them with­out, &amp; more pernitious to the Church then of any others. Some again wil have this prohibitiō onely to take place, when the multitude of the offenders is so great, as that they cannot be censured without <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7809"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=59">[Page 118]</a></span> danger of schisme, and distraction, as though the multitude of of­fenders should priveledge the offence, and as though the Lord Ie­sus by his power given to his Church; 1 Cor. 5. 4. should fear to meddle with them for their multitude, and might, as David feared to meddle with the <span class="hi">sonnes of Zeruiah,</span> because they <span class="hi">were too hard for him.</span> The Apostle sayth, (speaking of the incestious man) that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note322">1 Cor. 5. 6.</span> ▪ <span class="hi">little leaven leaveneth the whole lump:</span> how much more a great deal, which makes all more sower.</p><p>And for answer to both, it is apparant the Lord here forbidds the rooting out of any tares whither fewer or more in number, whither of high or low growth.</p><p>Let men then cease to draw in by the hayr of the head these pa­rables for the tolerating of the wicked in the Church: (an intolle­rable wickednes) as most prejudicial to the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note323">Isa. 52. 5.

It wilbe sayd that tares are easily discerned frō wheat: I answer not alwayes so, though oakes may, as one of your owne hath spoken upon this scripture:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note327">Mr Cartw.</span> and it is certainly reported by such as have travayled Iury &amp; those parts, to which the Lord hath reference, that the weeds we call tares are there very hardly discerned from the true wheat. If it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7879"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=59">[Page 119]</a></span> be further pressed that the tares are espied, I do further answer, that it is in parables both curiosity and danger to labour to make all partes meet in every particular: and since this particular of spying the tares is omitted by Christ in the exposition wee may well be modest in it. But let it be that the tares are seen (as the words are) the question is who those servants are espying them, and so desi­ring to have them rooted out. These servants may well be some speciall persons in the Church endued with a singular spirit of watchfulnes, and discerning, by which they do discover in some persons this tarish disposition vnder the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ayl of holynes: so Paul spied out that bitter root of <span class="hi">envy,</span> and pride, by which some were<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note328">Phil. 1▪ 15. 16.</span> set a work <span class="hi">to preach Christ:</span> such persons notwithstanding must be born till their sinnes be ripe, and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note329">Psa. 125. 5.</span> <span class="hi">the Lord lead them forth amongst the workers of iniquity.</span> Or by the servants may be here meant the An­gels, who by conversing much with the Ch: both can &amp; without doubt do through the subtilty of their nature, &amp; long experience spy out in the Church much cloked wickednes, &amp; impiety, which as the zealous ministers of Gods justice they are ready to revenge.</p><p>But since the Lord Iesus, who best knew his owne meaning, calls<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note330">vers. 38.</span> the <span class="hi">feild the world,</span> and makes<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note331">v. 39.</span> <span class="hi">the harvest</span> which is the end of the field, <span class="hi">the end of the world,</span> and not of the Church, why should we admit of any other interpretation? Neyther is it like that Christ would in the expounding of one parable speak an other, as he should have done, if calling the feyld the world, he had meant the Church. As God then in the beginning made man good, &amp; pla­ced him in the field of the world there to grow, where by the envy of the serpent he was soon corrupted, so ever since hath the seed of the serpent (stirred vp by their father the Divel) snarled at the heel of the womans seed, and like noysome tares vexed and peste­red the good and holy seed, which though the children of God both see, and feel to their payne, yet must they not therefore<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note332">Luk. 9. 54. 56.</span> <span class="hi">for­getting what spirit they are of, presently call for fyre from heaven,</span> nor pre­vent the Lords hand, but wayt his leasure, eyther for the conver­ting of these tares into wheat, (which in many is dayly seen; and thē how great pitty had it been they should so vntimely have been plucked vp:) or for their finall perdition in the day of the Lord, when the Church shalbe no more offended by them.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7949"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=60">[Page 120]</a></span>And that the Lord Iesus no way speaks of the toleration of pro­phane persons in the<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> Church doth appear by these reasons.</p><p>First, because (as hath been observed) he doth not contradict<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note333">I.</span> himself by forbidding the vse of the keyes in one place, which in an other he hath turned vpō impenitent offenders, Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</p><p>2.

But our exceptiō in this case is, first that the Church of En­gland was never truely gathered, the Church of England I say, that that is, the National Church, consisting of the Provinciall Chur­ches, and those of the Diocesan Churches, and the Diocesans of the Parochyall Churches, according to their parish precincts, with <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8021"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=60">[Page 121]</a></span> their governours &amp; government correspondent. That there were true visible Churches in the land gathered out of Paganism at the first, I will not deny, but that ever the whole Land in the bo­dy of it was a Church is an affirmatiō of them which consider not what is eyther the matter whereof, or the manner how the Church of the new Testament is to <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e gathered. 2. Graunt that the way of the kingdom of Christ, the Church were now so wyde that a whol nation might walk a brest in it, and that England had been some times that Canaan, the holy land, wherein none vncircumcised person dwelt, yet in the apostasy of Antichrist it could not be so ac­counted, but was in the body of it divorced frō Christ with Rome, whereof it was a member, except you (Mr B.) will affirm (as ma­ny do) that Rome remaines still a true visible Church, and that an­tichristianism is true Christianism, Antichristians true Christians, the body which hath the Pope the head, the true body of Christ: &amp; so except the Church of Engl. had been sowen with good seed without tares since that general apostasie, it cannot be the L. field.</p><p>The Iewes were forbidden by God vnder the law to<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note338">Lev. 19. 19.</span> <span class="hi">sow their field with divers seeds,</span> and will he sow his own feyld with divers, yea with cōtrary seeds, wheat, &amp; tares?

But the truth is otherwise in the parish Church of Worksop, and in all other the parish Churches in the land. You have one onely member that hath power, (and that vn­der the ordinary) to any of these things, and that your self the par­rish Priest, though perhaps the parish clerk may by speciall indul­gence be licensed, to bury the dead, Church women, read service on light holy dayes, and do some such like drudgery in your ab­sence. But for the exercising of the censures, that belongs not to the whole body, or to any member thereof principall, or lesse principall, but to the Bishops and his substitute, which are forreyners and strangers as in theyr office from the true Church, so even in theyr persons from yours. All your portion in the cen­sures Mr B. is to do the exequutioners office, when the Officiall hath played the iudge, which if you should be so bold as to refuse, besydes the punishment of your contumacy, the Church doore would do your office, for the bull of excommunication hanged vp there by the sumner byndes the offenders both in heaven &amp; earth. And for the position it self, howsoever we do indeed maynteyne the most of the particulars against which Mr B. intends his refuta­tion, yet as he sets it down, we do vtterly disclayme it with all the errors in it.</p><p>First for teaching in the Church we do not vse it promiscuously, nor suffer it to be vsed but according to the order (as we are per­swaded) which Christ and his Apostles have prescribed.

Onely I desyre it may be obser­ved that rather then Mr B. will forbeare to accuse vs that we hold it lawfull for one person to excommunicate the whole Church, he will back this most odious calumniation with as fond and false an assertion: and that is, that <span class="hi">separating from a Church and</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note345">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">excommunicating of it is all one in substance, though called lesse odiously.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note346">Answ.</span> But the contrary is manifested by these two reasons.</p><p>First excommunication is a sentence judiciall presupposing ever a solemn and superiour power over the party sentenced: but no such thing is inferred vpon separation.</p><p>2.

If a company of faythful people without officers be not a Church, then if all the officers of a Church should dye or fall away the Church should be nullified, and become no church: and to come nearer home (graunting for a while the parish of Worksop to be a company of faythfull people) if Mr Bernard should leave his Vicaridge for a better, then the church of Work­sop should be dischurched, and remayne a Church no longer: <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8592"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=64">[Page 128]</a></span> and thus an assembly might be Churched and vnchurched, and Churched agayn every week in the time of persecution or plague, by having and loosing, and recovering againe her officers: and thus the officers should not be the eyes or tongue of the body, for the body remaynes a true (though an imperfect) body without them, but the head of it: yea the Pope though he hold himself the head of the Church, yet acknowledgeth it a Church without him, and in the time of vacancy.</p><p>Wee read, Rev. 2. 5. that the Lord threatens to <span class="hi">remove the can­dlestick</span> from the Ephesians except they amend.

If a company of Saynts, where no officers are, be not a true<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note362">VII.</span> visible Church, then may they have no visible communion toge­ther eyther publick, or private; the reason is, because the commu­nion of saynts is an effect, or property of the Church, and the Church a cause of it: the invisible Church of invisible com­munion, and the visible Church of visible communion. And as we can have no fellowship with Christ in his merits, and other works of mediation, till we be in our persons ioyned vnto him by faith, and grafted in him, as the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note363">Ioh. 15. 1. 2. 4.</span> <span class="hi">braunches in the vine:</span> so neither can we have communiō one with another in any spirituall grace, or work, till we be vnited one to another in love, as the members of the body vnder the head. Communion in works whether na­turall, civil, or religious, doth necessarily presuppose vnion of per­sons. Yea if such a company be not a Church, I see not how their seed can have right to baptism, no nor how their own baptism cā be accounted true in the right ends, &amp; vses of it. For 1. baptism is within, and not without the Church: Ephe. 4. 4. 5. Secondly, it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8647"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=64">[Page 129]</a></span> is the seal of the covenant (which is the form of the Church) to the faithfull, and their seed, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 2. 38. 39. Thirdly, it is of the members into the body of Christ, 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 12. 12. 13.</p><p>Lastly where the essentiall causes of a Church are to be found, viz. matter and form, there is a Church. But this may be in such assemblies as have no officers, ergo.</p><p>The former proposition is evident in it self, for the essentiall cau­ses give being vnto the th<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> and it ha<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>h the being from them.</p><p>The 2. I gather from Mr B. own graunt, where treating of the causes and properties of the Church, he makes the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note364">pag. 112.</span> <span class="hi">true matter such as professe Christ Iesus their onely saviour:</span> and the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note365">pag. 116.</span> <span class="hi">form to be the vniting of men to God, and one to another visibly.</span> Now except he will say (which God forbid) that none may make profession of faith, and be vnited to Christ without officers, he cannot deny but there may be, (and so be called) a Church without them. For all vnited vnto Christ the head, are members of the body, which is the Ch: and so the whol assembly ioyntly considered is an whole and en­tyre body and Church. So that to deny an ordinary assembly or communion of Christians to be a Christian Church, is an vnchri­stian opinion. And here I entreat the indifferent reader to consi­der whether these mens wayes be equall, or no. When we deny their assemblies to be true visible Churches, though they consist for the most part of prophane, and vngodly persons, vnder the government of a Provinciall, or Diocesan Bishop, and the Mini­stery of a dumb or prophane Preist, as the most do, (to which al­so the best is subiect within one moneth) they complayn of vs, as most injurious detracters, and yet will not they acknowledge any assembly of faithful &amp; holy people onely (if vnfurnished for a time of officers) to be a true Church, or capable of that denomination. But let not the harts of Gods servants be discouraged, he is no accepter of mens persons, he hath not tyed his power and pre­sence to any order, or office in the world, but accepted of them that feare him, and work righteousnes, hating the assemblyes of the wicked, and all their sacrifices.</p><p>Vpon this point I haue insisted the longer, partly because it is the ground of the other truthes to be handled in their places, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8699"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=65">[Page 130]</a></span> partly in detestation of the vnsufferable pryde of this Prelacy, and Preisthood, which will have the very life of all Churches to hang on the breath of their nostrels, yea (I may safely say) on their lusts; if they dy yea or forsake their charges in never so fleshly respects their Churches are dissolved, at least during the vacancy, and so the brethren dismembred from being of the visible body of Christ. But so far are the officers from being the formall cause of the Church (as is intended) as they are in truth no absolutely necessa­ry appurtenance vnto it. The power indeed to enioy them is an essentiall property seated in the body which may braunch out it self (as God gives fit means) into officers accordingly, which if they prove unfruitful, it may also accordingly lop, or break off. And so farr is the Holy Ghost from giving countenance to this opinion, that the Officers make the Church, as when he speakes distinctly of the body, and officers, and considers them severally, he calls the body the Church, excluding the Elders, as appeares in these, amongst many o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>her scriptures. <span class="hi">Act.</span> 14. 23. &amp; 15. 4. <span class="hi">and</span> 20. 17. 28. 1 <span class="hi">Tim.</span> 3. 5. 15. And the reason is, because the Church is essentially in the saincts, as the matter, subject, formed by the co­ver<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ant, unto which the officers are but adjuncts, not making for the being, but for the welbeing of the Church, and furtherance of her fayth, by their service.</p><p>The second poynt now comes to be manifested, which is that two or three faythful persons joyned unto the Lord in the fellow­ship of the Gospel, have immediate interest to Christ in all his or­dinances.</p><p>Now least any should stumble at these words, <span class="hi">two or three ioyned or gathered together</span> (as it seems Mr. B. would hereby take advantage to discountenance so small a number) it must be cōsidered, that two or three thus gathered together have the same right with two or three hundred.

But this I desire the reader here to take knowledge of, and ever hereafter to beare in minde, that it is one thing for the officers to govern the Church (which we graunt) and another thing for them to be the Church, which Mr B. in expounding <span class="hi">Math:</span> 18. would needs make them; where he would have the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note385">Ezech: <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>3. 2. 3.</span> officers alone to admonish, and censure.

The officers of the Church are to govern every action, of the Church, and exercise of the communion: are they therefore alone to do al things? They (if there be any of them in the Church) are to govern in every election and choyce of en­suing Officers, are they therefore, alone to chuse▪ excluding the Church? They are to govern in preaching, prophesying, and hea­ring the word, and receiving the sacraments, singing of Psalmes, distributing vnto the necessities of the sayncts, are they therefore alone to prophesie, to sing Psalmes, to contribute to the poor &amp; the rest, with as little reason can it be affirmed, that they alone are to have cōmunion in the censures, to admonish, &amp; judge, because they are to govern in the carying &amp; administring of those matters.</p><p>These things thus cleared, it wil be very convenient for the pur­pose in hand, and wil give much furtherance to the truth, in a few words to consider of the nature of Ecclesiastical government, and governours, which whilst politik men through either ignorance, or contempt of the gospels simplicitie, do neglect, they labour to transform the Church into a wordly kingdome, and to set over it a kinde of kingly and lordly government: and such scriptures as give libertie and power unto kings, and other civile officers over their subjects, and people, for the making and altering of lawes, and for the passing, and ordering of judgements, these they per­vert and misapply to Church governours and government: then which nothing is more monstrous. <span class="hi">Math.</span> 20. 25. 26. 27. 28. 1 <span class="hi">Pet.</span> 5. 3.</p><p>I.

Such, and none other is the Elders, or Bishops government.</p><p>Now to conclude this point. All the scriptures which Mr B. brings (as the reader may see) serves to prove that the governers of the Church, must be in, and of the Church they govern: but the governers of the Church of Worxsop, are not of it, neyther would Mr B. I dare say, be well pleased they should.

More particularly. The two former places speak of the Church at Ierusalem, where some of the Apostles were ever present: what marveil then if the congregation attempted nothing without them?

But to let passe these more generall things and to come to the speciall busines mentioned: <span class="hi">Act. 14, 23.</span> The same rules which were after left in writing to Timothy and Titus for the choyce of Bishops, or Elders were then in use amongst the Chur­ches: &amp; amongst other qualifications, it was required of them that they should be <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note389">1 Tim. 3, 1, 2, 4, 5.</span> <span class="hi">apt to teach,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note390">Tit. 1, 5. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 9.</span> <span class="hi">able to convince,</span> as also to manage the publique affaires of the Churches, which were to depend on them, whither in cases of controversie, or otherwise, and such they both then were, and now are by good tryal and experience to be known to be: and those also <span class="hi">no young plants</span> for such fruits.

The Apostles came, but occasionally to visit the Churches, and to comfort them, making (in many very small or no continuance) and fynding fit men for officers in the Churches where they came, and the same known, testified and commended to be such by the peoples election, they ordeyned Bishops or Elders over them, and so departed. <span class="hi">Act. 14. 21. 22. 23.</span></p><p>And what reason can be given, why the Apostles did not at the first planting of the Churches, but so long a space after, ordeyn officers, (as also that Paul did not perform that busines himself in Creta, but left Titus the Evangelist for that purpose, <span class="hi">Tit. 1. 5.</span>) save onely that men of gifts might be trayned vp in prayer, prophe­cying, and carrying of such other Church affaires as fell out, and so due tryall made of theyr gifts, &amp; good knowledg taken of their faythfulnes in and by the Churches whereof they were, and over which they were to be set, being found fit for that service? Now the fourth scripture which is, <span class="hi">1 Cor. 5.</span> doth directly oppose that for which it is brought. It was the Churches fault not to have pur­ged out that sower leven, the incestuous person before they eyther heard from Paul, or he of that evill amongst them: and for theyr negligence herein the Apostle reproveth them, as all men see that are not willingly blynd. And for Paul he in generall as a penman of the Holy Ghost wrote scriptures for the direction of the Corinthians and all other Churches to the worldes end, and in speciall, as a chief Officer of that Church by <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note392">v. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">determining</span> for himself discharged his owne duety: but did neyther <span class="hi">begin, govern, nor compose the action:</span> being at Philippi▪ or rather at Ephesus for the present, from whence he writ the Epistle to the Church, vn­to which he commended the busines in hand, both for the be­ginning, and ending of it.</p><p>But what of all these, and many other the like scriptures to be alledged? because the Churches are in all things to be guided by theyr officers ministring faythfully, and according to the word of God, and theyr duety, that therefore if eyther there be no officers, or if they be absent, or fayl in their duety, the Church may do no­thing eyther for information, or reformation?</p><p>The scriptures record, that after Stevens death <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note393">Act. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1. 4.</span> <span class="hi">all the Church</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9425"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=70">[Page 140]</a></span> <span class="hi">a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Ierusalem was dispersed save the Apostles, and that they which were dis­persed went to and fro, preaching the word,</span> the effect of whose preaching amongst the Gentiles was <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note394">Act. 11 20. 21.</span> <span class="hi">the fayth and conversion of a great number vnto the Lord.</span></p><p>Here were not onely Church matters but even Churches be­gun, <span class="hi">preaching to and fro, turning and ioyning of multitudes to the Lord,</span> &amp; that where neyther Apostles no<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> other officers were present, for this is too grosse to affirm that <span class="hi">during al the Apostles dayes nothing</span> was begun but by them. And what if the Lord should now rayse vp a company of faythfull men and women in Barbary, or America, by the reading of the scriptures, or by the wrytings, conferences, or sufferings of some godly men, must they not separate themselves from the filthines of the heathen to the Lord? nor turn from Idols to the true God? nor ioyne themselves vnto him in the fellowship of the gospell? nor have any communion together for theyr mutuall aedification, and comfort, till some vagrant Preist from Rome or England be sent vnto them to begin theyr Church matters with his service book?

Nay if this were a true ground, that Church matters might not be begun without officers, it were impossible that such a people should ever eyther enioy officers, or become a Church, yea I may safely ad, that ever there should be in the world after the vniversal visible apostacy of Antichrist, any true eyther Church, or officers; and so we must hold with the Arians, that except ther should come new Apostles to gather the Churches, and so a new Christ to call those Apostles, that there can be to the worlds end neyther true Churches nor true officers. The reason is,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note395">Heb. 5. 4.</span> because * <span class="hi">no man takes this honour vnto himself, but he that is called of God a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Aaron:</span> Now God calls no man ordinarily but by the Ch:, (for I suppose you will not deny but that the choyce of officers is a Ch: matter &amp; not a matter of the world.)

Whence it followeth, that both Church matters, yea and Churches also may and in cases must be begun without officers. Yea even where officers are, if they fayl in theyr duetyes, the people may enterprise matters needfull, howsoever you will have the minister the onely <span class="hi">primum movens,</span> and will ty all to his fingers. And to let passe the godly Kings of Iudah which were no Church officers (about whom the question is) which sundry tymes set the Preists a work, &amp; other with them in Church matters, as <span class="hi">2.

Now how soever they which so contended with him erred in the matter, and it is like, dealt too contumeliously with him in the manner, yet had it been simply vnlawfull for them to have propounded, and begun a matter of that kynde, Peter would have reproved and broken off theyr disorderly course, and not have per­taken with them in their sinne by vndertaking the answer of the matter, which in the generall he doth approve, by his orderly, and satisfactory answer.</p><p>Furthermore, where the Lord Iesus, <span class="hi">Math. 18. 19.</span> directs a bro­ther in case, &amp; order, to <span class="hi">tell the Church</span> of his brothers offence, what can be more playne then that he enioynes a private brother to begin a Church matter? Yea though there be Elders in the Church, yea though the Elders alone, yea the chief of them one­ly (as Mr Bernard would have it) be the Church, yet must the mat­ter be brought to, and begun in the Church by him that is offen­ded, and his witnesses.

God forbid. And leave them he may not till he have dealt with them about this Church matter, and convinced them of this Church sinn: for if Christ would not have a brother cast of his brother til he have dealt with him, nor the whole Church to cast of a private member, till <span class="hi">he refuse to hear it, Math. 18.</span> much lesse will he have one brother to forsake all the brethren, and offi­cers also, or a private member to disclaym the whole Church till he have by the best meanes he can affoard in himself, or procure o­therwise, and after the best manner, convinced, admonished and exhorted both the Officers and people, and so found them obsti­nate and irreclamable.</p><p>To proceed.

Of these things the more largely I haue spoken in the generall, I may be the breifer in the particulars. Onely for conclusion I must demaund of Mr B. this question: if Church matters be to be performed onely by mi­nisters, why his Sexton being no minister reads divine service in his absence, and that by authority from the Ordinary. If this be not a Church matter, and that materiall, there is small Church mat­ter in the most Churches in the land.</p><p>Now the last thing I have to observe touching this first reason is, that so far as the authour speaks the truth in it, so far he speaks most playnly against himself.

For the law (with you Mr B.) allowes not onely Ministers ordeyned at large, without any certeyn congregations, but enti­tles them also to their speciall cures, without so much as the peo­ples knowledge: many parishes never seing the faces of their mini­sters till they come to ring their belles in signe of victory: much lesse doth the law provide, they should be approved, least of all that they should be chosen, and presented by them.</p><p>As the truth you speak in this place makes against you, so had you spoken more fully, you had brought more cleare testimony against <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9738"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=72">[Page 145]</a></span> yourself, you do therefore take vp yourself in time, and mingle some vntruthes amōg▪ like darknes with light, least the light should shine too clearely in the eyes of the reader.</p><p>Where you then affirm that <span class="hi">the people did onely approve of the Le­vites at the Lords appointment when they took their charge,</span> Numb. 3. 6▪ 12.

The shutting of this doore (which is also the binding of sinnes) is the declaration and denunciation of the wrath of God, against sinne, and of coudemnatiō vpō per­sons impenitent, and vnbeleevers: and both these according to the pleasure of the mayster of the house, though the latter of them be not of the nature of the gospell, which is in it self <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note410">2 Cor. 3. 6</span> <span class="hi">the mini­stery of life, and of the spirit which giveth life,</span> but accidentall vnto it, by mens own fault, which through their vnbeleeving, &amp; impenitent hearts turne this key as it were, the wrong way vpon themselves.</p><p>Now by the evidence of the former generall truth approved (I doubt not) to the conscience of every indifferent man (which is, that a company of faithfull people vnited together in the fellow­ship <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9867"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=73">[Page 147]</a></span> of the gospel, though without officers, is a Church, This specialty in hand wilbe cleared. And wheresoever the promise of forgivenes of sinnes, and life eternall is to be found, there hangeth the golden key of heaven gates, there sinnes are loosed in heaven: for what els is it to loose sinnes, but to publish, proclayme, or de­clare in the word of God &amp; righteousnes of Christ, the forgive­nes of sinnes to them that repent.

But the pointes in controversie betwixt vs are first, whether these things and all of them, and with them all o­ther Church affairs not here mentioned, be so appropriated to the Officers, as that none other may meddle with them: and 2. whe­ther this power be committed to them immediately from, and by Christ, or mediately from Christ by the Church: which considera­tion whilest you neglect, you erre your self, deceive such as follow you, and injury them you oppose.

But we for our partes do beleeve &amp; professe that this promise is not made to Peter in any of these fore­named respects, nor to any office, order, estate, dignity, or degree in the Church, or world, but to the confession of faith, which Pe­ter made by way of answer to Christs question, who demaunding of the disciples, v. 15. whom (amongst the variety of opinions that went of him, ver. 14.) they thought him to be, was an­swered by Peter in the name of the rest, <span class="hi">Thou art Christ the sonne of the l<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ving God,</span> ver. 16.

And thus the Protestant divines (when they deal against the Popes supremacy) do generally expound this scripture, though Mr B. directly make the Pope and his shavelings Peters successours in this place, as hereafter wil appeare. Now vpon the former ground it followeth, that whatsoever person hath received the same pre­tious faith with Peter (as all the faithfull have, <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Pet. 1. 1.</span>) that per­son hath a part in this gift of Christ: whosoever doth confesse pu­blish, manifest, or make knowen Iesus to be that Christ the sonne of the living God, and Saviour of the world, that person opens heavē gate, looseth sin, &amp; partakes with Peter in the vse of the keys.</p><p>And herevpon also it followeth necessarily, that one faithful man, yea or woman eyther, may as truely, and effectually loose, and bind, both in heaven, and earth, as all the Ministers in the world.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10199"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=75">[Page 151]</a></span>But here I know the Lordly clergy, like the bulles of Bashan, will roar lowd vpon me, as speaking things intollerably derogato­ry to the dignitie of Preisthood, and it may be some others also, eyther through ignorance, or superstition, will take offence at this speach, as confounding all things: but there is no such cause of exception.

A man may call such a woman his wife, before they be actually maryed, and such a child his heire, though he be not for the present possessed of a foot of his inheritance, nor like to be before the testators death: and that this was the condition of the twelve, I prove by these reasons.</p><p>If the twelve were called to the office of Apostles, <span class="hi">Mat. 16.</span> then Christ called men to an office, for which they were altogether vn­fit, &amp; vnfurnished, which to imagine were impious against Christ.</p><p>Now that they were vtterly vnapt to this office, appeares in these particulars.</p><p>First they vvanted that Christian fortitude, and courage, vvhich vvas most needfull for that office.</p><p>Secondly, they were ignorant of the nature of Christs kingdom▪ not forecasting his death, nor beleeving his resurrection, vnfurni­shed also with the gift of tongues, and so vtterly vnable to teach the gentiles, for whose sake they received their commission in a speciall manner, <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 16. 21. 22. &amp; 20. 20. 21. &amp; 26. 51. <span class="hi">Mark.</span> 16. 11. 14. <span class="hi">Luke</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>4. 21. <span class="hi">Act.</span> 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. <span class="hi">Mat.</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>8. 19. <span class="hi">Ephe.</span> 3. 5. 6.</p><p>2.

They <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10610"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=78">[Page 156]</a></span> were extraordinary officers in the first plāting of the faith amongst the gentiles, theyr qualifications extraordinary, and miraculous, as the gift of tongues, and the like, and so theyr offices were de­termined in theyr persons. And yet I deny not but the true Mi­nisters of the gospell the Bishops or Elders, in theyr particular Churches do succeed the Apostles (though not in office) yet in theyr ordinary ministration of the word, sacraments, censures, prayer, ordination, &amp; all other ordinances of the Church whatsoever, ac­cording to the order Christ hath left; but that the Apostles and E­vangelists have by any order committed theyr power or any part of it to any such <span class="hi">Cheif Ministers</span> or rather Lords, yea spiritual tyrāts as the Lordbishops &amp; Archbishops in Engl. are, that I deny withall my power. There are no such cheifteyns in the Church of Christ, or communion of saynts.

I know well what Mr B. infers: namely, that the cheif Ministers alone in the Churches whether <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10685"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=78">[Page 157]</a></span> pure, or impure (by which latter he meanes the Church of Rome) as he expounds himself▪ pag. 145. that is, that Popes, Cardinalls, Archbishops, Bishops, Suffraganes, Chauncelours▪ and the rest of the triumphant Clergy, and they alone should medle with supres­sing errour, rectifying things amisse, calling and ordayning mini­sters, and that all others are absolutely inhibited any medling with these things. Well, (to let passe your fearefull retyring (Mr B.) in­to the battered bulwarks of the Papists for succour, and the dis­charging of your selfe, and all the inferiour ministery that these cheif ministers might reigne alone) the scriptures do not debar<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e the members of the Church from medling in those things in their place, and order, nor impropriate them to the cheife Lords, as is pretended, onely they declare that the officers are to do theyr own duetyes in those businesses, and to put the brethren in remem­brance of theyrs, to commaund, teach, and speak those things, ex­horting &amp; rebuking with all authority by the word of God as oc­casion serves. 1 <span class="hi">Tim.</span> 4. 6. 11. <span class="hi">Tit.</span> 2. 15. And if Mr B. will conclude any thing for his purpose by the scriptures he alledgeth he must take this position for graunted, that whatsoever Paul wrytes to Timothy, or Titus, touching the Church, about that onely they, &amp; theyr successours the cheif ministers are to medle; which presump­teous affirmation is sufficiently refuted by the very recitall of it. He that reads over the Epistles but with a pece of an ey may see the contrary.

If the officers must judge, and excommunicate in the open assembly, then can they alone in no sense be the Church. For the Church is nothing but the assembly. And it is all one to say the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note422"><span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span></span> officers in the assembly, are the Church, as to say the officers in the assembly, are the assembly▪ which is a senseles affirmation. And if the Officers alone be the Church, to which complaint is to be made, and which is to reprove the offender and judge him, they must do it in a distinct assembly from the body, and not in the as­sembly compounded necessarily of the officers and the body: as your Courtkeepers doe in their Consistories, &amp; the Elders in the reformed Churches in their private Chambers.</p><p>3. It is most vntrue which you say, that no more can be gathe­red from this place, but that excommunication was performed in the presence of the body of the Church, and with their knowledge being gathered together: it is apparent that they which were <span class="hi">ga­thered together, were by the power of Christ to deliver to Satan the offender, to purge out the old leven, to iudge, and to put out from among themselves that wicked fornicatour.</span> v. 5. 6. 7. 12. 13. of which more hereafter.</p><p>And so I come to the 4.

Similitudes (as they say) do not run vpon four feet: &amp; to streyn them above that which is intended by the holy Ghost in vsing them, is a course full both of vanity and errour. The Deacons are the handes of the Church for the distribution of her bodily things to them that need, &amp; yet I trow, you would not have the Church suffer the poore to starve, where the Deacons are wanting to minister, or fayling in their mi­nistration: so are the Elders the eyes &amp; mouth of the Church for her government, and ministration of spirituall things, &amp; yet must not the Church perish spiritually for their want, or negligence: no, the Lord is more mercifull to his people then so, and doth nor ty them so short in the meanes of their aedification, &amp; salvation, how streyt and hard hearted soever you M. B. are towards them, or cō ­temptuous of them: they may, and must use in cases of necessity their best helpes, for the distribution of things simply necessary to the body. And dare you say (as you haue done in both your books) that the officers are absolutely to the Church, as the eyes <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11006"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=81">[Page 162]</a></span> to the body? and that there is no spirituall light in the rest of the members save onely in them? and that all the body besides and without them is darknes? Indeed such a blind beetle your spiri­tuall Lords, and you make your Churches, and so you lead them. But, oh you the people of God, yet in Babylon, partakers of the heavenly illumination, trust not these your Seers too much. they would be thought all ey from top to bottom, and would make you beleeve, that you the multitude are stoneblind, and can not possibly without them see one step before you, that so they might lead you by the lip, whither they list: but open your eyes more and more, and you shall see more and more clearely that the wayes of your Nationall Church▪ are not the wayes which Christ hath left for his visible Churches to walk in, but a very by path: and take heed that these men, which would be thought all, and onely light, cause not a <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>og of earthly ordinances to rise vpon you, and a dark mist to cover you.</p><p>To proceed. This one scripture, <span class="hi">Ephe.</span> 4. 11. 12. truely expoun­ded, and according to the Apostles meaning, serves at one blow to overthrow the whol ministery of your Church of England, and all communion with it.</p><p>Your whol plea for your Ministery is, that you teach the word of God, &amp; the true word of God, and therewith you invite all your guests vnto your bāquet. But now if your ministery be not the Mi­nistery which Christ hath set vp in his Ch: no<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> of the gifts, which he hath givē vnto his Church, but of an other sort, &amp; foundatiō, then it followes that no felowship or cōmuniō is to be had with it vnder any plausible pretense, nor vpon any experimentall profit neyther.</p><p>The officers thē which Christ hath given for the aedificatiō of his Church to the worlds end are, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pa­stors, &amp; Teachers, <span class="hi">Ephe.</span> 4. 11. 12. Now the first three sorts of these a­bovenamed were extraordinary, &amp; extraordinarily endued, for the first publishing of faith, and planting of Churches, and so as tem­porary are ceased, with their endowments, and this you graunt in effect, pag. 184. of your last book. And for the <span class="hi">Pastor<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> and <span class="hi">Teachers</span> here spoken of, you Mr B: and the Ministers of your or­der would be thought the men. Of what sort then (I pray you) <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11079"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=81">[Page 163]</a></span> are your grand Metropolitans, your Archbishops, Bishops, Suffra­ganes, Deanes, Archdeacons, Chauncelours, Officials and the re­sidew of that Lordly Clergy? They must needs be of some other order then is here named, and the gifts of some other cheif Lord then of Christ, when he ascended on high, and gave his gifts, &amp; that is Antichrist, whose gifts they were when he ascended on high, even to the throne of his Apostasy.</p><p>And now for you, which are set over the particular Parishes, to teach the people, (as I confesse you of all the rest to be likest vnto the true Pastours) so by your own confession are you excluded frō that rank. The Officers which Christ hath appointed, when he ascended, have received power (by your own assertion) not onely <span class="hi">for preaching and administring the sacraments,</span> but <span class="hi">for government also.</span> The<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note431">pag. 92.</span> want then of the power of government bewrayeth you to be ano­thers gift then Christs, even his and none others, which hath de­vised an other order, and distribution of giftes then ever came in­to Christs hart to appoint.</p><p>Lastly, as it is true you affirm, that <span class="hi">Christ never sayd to the body of the congregation,</span> viz: in expresse termes, <span class="hi">go preach,</span> so is it most vntrue which you intend, viz: that he never gave libertie, and charge to any out of office to teach in the exercise of prophesy. This point I have touched formerly, but will more fully handle hereafter. The same I also affirme in the second place touching the <span class="hi">power of govern­ment,</span> not opposing your words well interpreted, but your mea­ning, which is, that none but men in office have power eyther to reforme any abuse in the Church or to perform any other neces­sary Church duty without them. And for shutting vp of this fourth Argument, let it be considered, that here is a great difference in administration of doctrine by teaching, and of admonition &amp; ex­communication in the order of discipline. Onely one man in the Church doth teach at once, and all the rest both Elders &amp; peo­ple are taught by him, but the whol Church may admonish, or ex­communicate one or more at once, or by one act: and so though Christ never say to the Church, goe teach, yet, he sayth to the Ch: admonish, &amp; excommunicate. <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 18. 17. 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 5. 4. 5.

There are in deed in the cōmon wealth Kings, and Magistrates in authority under them, partakers of their king­ly power by subordination, by which participation they proper­ly and effectually even as the King himself, bind and loose, save and destroy, exact and procure obedience civily both in Church and cōmon wealth, and that by a kingly and lordly power over the people, whose Kings, Lords, and Maysters they are: but the Of­ficers <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11271"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=82">[Page 165]</a></span> in the Church are in no such authority by participation of Christs kingly power, neyther can they properly and effe­ctually bind and loose, save and destroy, exact and procure obedience as Christ doth: neyther are they, as civil Magistrates, though the Kings servants, and ministers, yet the peoples Lords, and maysters, but both Christs, and the peoples servants, and Mi­nisters.</p><p>Now let any judge that hath in him eyther religion, or reason, conscience or cōmon sense, if it be not irreligious, vnconscionable, vnreasonable, and senselesse that the body of the Church should have no more liberty and power in the imployments of their ser­vants and Ministers in their Office, then the body of the cōmon wealth in the imployments of their Lords, and Maysters in their Office. To this also I may adde, that there are many civil ordinā ­ces and constitutions in the common wealth which concerne not one of a thowsand of the Kings people, many Magistrates &amp; Of­ficers chosen the inferiour by the superiour without the peoples privity or cōsent, many administratiōs vsed, judgemēts passed, &amp; ex­equutions done, which the greatest part of the people do not (nor are bound) so much as once to enquire after: much lesse are they bound to complayn of the breach of every civil ordinance, to see it reformed, to charge every Magistrate to look to his office, to admonish him if in any thing he deale corruptly, or wickedly, and if he will not be reclaymed but goe obstinately on (in the spirit of an Haeretick, Idolater, or Atheist) to disclaym or depose him: but in the Church, all and every ordinance concernes every person (as a part of their communion) (without the dispensation of ne­cessity) for their vse, and <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note438">1 Cor. 3. 22. &amp; 14. 26.</span> <span class="hi">aedification:</span> all the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note439">Act. 1. 15 23. 26. and 6. 1. 2. 3. 5. and 14. 23. &amp; 15. 2. 3. 2.

But if in these scriptures he thus sever, and sejoyne the officers, and people, why might not the officers be excluded by a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> good consequence, by other verses of these Chapters, where mention is made of the Churches, and not of the Angels, as the people in these, where the Angels onely, and not the people are mentioned? and both alike. The answer, and truth then is, that Iohn <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note444">Rev. 1. 11.</span> <span class="hi">writes and sendes these Epistles or this book, to the 7.

As if the King at any time write his letters to any corporation in the land about some such publick busines, as wherein every free man hath an hand, he directs them to the MAIOR, BAYLY, or some other cheife offi­cer, by whome they are to be published to the whole body, and the matter managed, which they conteyn, though as I former­ly sayd, every freeman be to speak to, and consent in the bu­sines.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11459"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=84">[Page 168]</a></span>And here it is too much Mr B. should say (as he doth) that <span class="hi">no mention in these places of the revelation is made of the people, but of the gover­nours onely,</span> where Christ expresly enjoynes Iohn <span class="hi">to write his vision, and to send it vnto the 7.

Onely I must needs shew Mr B. his great oversight, that, where he should prove, that onely the angels of the Churches were reproved for suffering evils vnreformed, he points vs to sun­dry Angels, and Churches, where there is no mention at all made of suffring evils, but all of doing, as well by the Angels, as Chur­ches, as in Ephesus, Sardi, and Laodicea: and which is worse, vn­to other Angels, and Churches, where there were no evils at all worthy reproof eyther done or suffred: as in Smyrna, and Phila­delphia. And is not this sound dealing? The Lord Iesus finds no­thing in the Ch: of Smyrna &amp; Phyladelphia worthy of taxatiō, but all of cōmendation, ergo the cheif governours onely in these Chur­ches are reproved for suffring evils vnreformed. I now come to the particular scriptures, in number two, where mention is made of evils suffred vnreformed, and reproof layd vpon them which suf­fered them in the two Churches of Pergamus and Thyatira.</p><p>And that Iohn directs his reproofs against the Churches, and not against the Officers alone, I do thus manifest.</p><p>1.

But here behold the fruites of an vnstable mind. This man in his for­mer book laboured by many scriptures, and reasons to lay downe the nature of the Churches government, and in speciall to prove, that the Church, <span class="hi">Math.</span> 18. 17. to vvhich complaint of sinns was to be made, was the cheif officers onely, and this he affirmes also to be <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note448">Pag. 98.</span> <span class="hi">the iudgement, and the practise of all reformed Churches.</span> But lo now in his second book, he devoures the hallowed thing, and labours vvithall his power to persvvade <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note449">pag. 211. 212.</span> <span class="hi">young divines,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">seely coun­try people,</span> (as he speakes) (and as in truth they had need be both young, and seely, that are perswaded by him) that <span class="hi">the points of disci­pline and Church-government are not so apparant by the scriptures, as that they can rightly iudge of them.</span> And to this end he brings in the va­riety of iudgements, and contradictions of learned men, some holding no government at all, others that an externall govern­ment is to be had, but of these, some holding it alterable, others constant, and perpetuall, and of these some to be in the Pope, &amp; Cardinalls, others in the body of the congregatiō, some in the Pres­bytery, with the peoples consent, and others, (which he puts last, as best and for which he brings sundry reasons, referring the rea­der <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11699"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=86">[Page 172]</a></span> to the treatises written to that end) in the Bishops his Lords. And againe touching the punishment of offenders, some he brings in holding excommunication, but not suspension, some holding both, and some neyther. And particularly for <span class="hi">Math.</span> 18. he mu­sters in thick, and threefold reasons and persons so reasoning, and proving, that the place (and so of <span class="hi">Lev.</span> 19. 17.) doth nothing at all concern discipline, or ecclesiasticall censures, but that Christs meaning there was onely to direct the Iewes how to carry things before the Synedrion, in cases of bodily injury. And thus he brings mens contrary opinions to darken the scriptures, which are most playne, like so many foul feet to trouble the pure fountaynes of living water, that the thirsty may not drink of them. And as a learned man in our age, &amp; nation, to discover the vanity of pro­gnosticatours, gathered together their contrary guesses of the we­ther, and so presented them: so this man to make the govern­ment of Christs Church as vncertayne as an Almanack, sets toge­ther, and so offers to the vvievv of the world the contrarieties of opinions concerning it. Now if other men should take this course Mr B. doth, in other points of religion, and one lay down the differences that are about predestination &amp; the points depending vpon it, some vtterly denying it, others affirming it, and of these some grounding it vpon Gods mere grace, others vpō mans faith, or workes foreseen: an other about baptisme, some denying it to all infants, others ministring it to all, others to such onely as are of Christian parents in a sort, and others onely to them that are of beleeving parents, at the least on the one side: a third about the Lords supper, in which point some hold transubstantiation, o­thers consubstantiation, others onely a sacramentall vnion, which some also will have merely rationall, others reall also: there could not be a playner way beaten for all Atheism to come into the world by, nor a course devised by the Divell more pregnant to perswade the multitude, that there were no certaynty, nor soundnes in the scriptures. But let God have the glorie of his truth, and of the clearnes in it, and let men bear the just blame, and shame of their naturall blyndnes: and in speciall let Christ have the honour of being as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note450">Heb. 3. 5. 6.</span> <span class="hi">faythfull in his owne house, as Moses was in his Maisters,</span> in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11730"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=86">[Page 173]</a></span> setting orders and officers in it and let not vile flesh dare to flatter Princes and Prelates, to mislead silly soules, and to preach liber­ty and licentiousnes to the world, make Christ Iesus an Idol King, having a kingdome vpon earth without lawes, or officers, for the administring of it: nor to make his redeemed, Idoll subjects, as whom it concerns little or nothing, whether they be vnder Chrits lawes, and officers, or vnder Antichrists his professed adversary.

I deny the very Apostles vsed any such Lordly and Papall au­thority, as to exclude eyther the inferiour officers, or people in Church affaires: the contrary is most evident in the choice of of­ficers, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 1. 15. 23. 26. <span class="hi">and</span> 6. 1. 2. 3. 5. censuring of offenders▪ 1 <span class="hi">Cor.</span> 5. and debating of other Church matters. <span class="hi">Act.</span> 15. 2. 3. 4. 6. 7. 22. 23. 30. &amp; 21. 22.</p><p>The 2.

And where you seem to make the <span class="hi">Chief Priests besides the high Preist,</span> a superiour order to the other formal­ly differing, it is more (if I be not deceived) then can be proved by the word of God. I know no diversity of administrations amongst them, but that any of the Priests might in their course, and order offer sacrifice, &amp; performe other the most solemne duties of preist­hood.</p><p>But where you further adde that <span class="hi">onely the high Priest did type out Christ, and not the other Preists so:</span> you are much mistaken. The whole preisthood of Aaron, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note457">Heb. 10. 1.

Lastly as I graunt one end of the subordination of Ministeries to have been the pre­serving of order, so I deny that same order is to be preserved in the nevv testament, and in the old. The order of the old testa­ment was the order of a nationall Church, but the order of the new testament is the order of a particular Church, where­in there needs no such subordination of Ministeries as in the o­ther which was nationall, the ey of common sense sees this dif­ference.</p><p>The <span class="hi">law of nature</span> whether written in the hart of man, or to be seen in the workmanship of the world, from which you draw your fift Argument, doth not prove superioritie amongst officers in a<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note458">V.</span> particular assembly, but onely that there must be government in all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11878"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=87">[Page 175]</a></span> societies, which may well be, though the governours be of one or­der, and rank.</p><p>Lastly they against whom you deale, <span class="hi">doe mainteyne</span> (as you say)<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note459">VI.</span> <span class="hi">an inequality in their government, in making the Pastor superiour to the Tea­cher.</span> &amp;c. and if they do so, why deal you against them? and why do you labour so carefully to prove against them their own practise to be lawful? though if they had not better warrāt then you bring, they were ill bestead. But this is the point, Mr B. (which you ne­ver touch) do they which hold two kindes of officers, teaching, and governing Elders, or they which hold three orders, Pastors, Teachers, and governing Elders, eyther of them both hold such a superioritie, as gives the superiour jurisdiction over the inferiour Ministers? do they make a Bishop of Bishops, or a sheepheard over a flock of sheepheards? or do they set vp any such ravenous crea­ture, as devours the liberty, and power both of the people, and o­ther officers, as your Bishops do, even as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note460">Gen. 41. 18. 19. 20.</span> <span class="hi">the leane and evill favoured kyne,</span> which Ioseph saw in his dreame, <span class="hi">ate vp the fat kyne, and welfa­voured:</span> And for the erroneous exposition of Luke, <span class="hi">Luk. 22. 25. 26.</span> by D.

And say in good sooth Mr B. would you haue men vnvoluntary professours against their wills, their profession must eyther be voluntary, with their wills, or vnvolun­tary, and against them. <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note461">Gen. 9. 27</span> <span class="hi">Noah</span> prophesying the calling of the Gentiles of Iaphets line, foretells, that <span class="hi">God will allure or perswade them to dwell in Shems tents.</span> And the scriptures do expressely affirme, that the Churches were gathered by <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note462">Act. 28. 24. 2 Cor. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 13.</span> <span class="hi">perswasion,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">voluntary submission vnto the gospel.</span> And it is a strange thing, even above wonder, that any man should have preached so many yeares, and written so many books about religion, and yet not know, that the nature of religion is not to be constreyned, but perswaded.</p><p>And tell me (Mr B.) did you subscribe the last tyme vnto your Bishops government <span class="hi">sponte</span> &amp; <span class="hi">ex animo,</span> according to the Canon, yea, or no?

Let Mr B: that I may vse his own words, Pag. 224. 225. <span class="hi">declare where els is</span> (not a more perfect rule, but) <span class="hi">any rule for it</span> left by Christ, <span class="hi">or</span> not <span class="hi">any supply,</span> but any mention made, <span class="hi">els where</span> &amp;c. The reasons now follow in the next place by which Mr B. would prove that Christ Iesus, <span class="hi">Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</span> speakes not of Church admonitions, and censures, but of private injuries, and the civil menaging of them.</p><p>His first reason is taken from <span class="hi">the cohaerence</span> of these verses with<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note464"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">that which goes before in the Chapter:</span> where <span class="hi">Christ, admonisheth his disci­ples to take heed both of the offences that should be given, as also of offending others.</span> True Mr B. for the meaning of Christ was not onely to pre­pare them against the manisold scandals, and stumbling stones of offence (especially in the new kingdom to which he prepared thē) which Satan would cast before them every step they took, eyther to turne them out of the way of life, or to stop them in it: but al­so to lay strayt charge vpon them, that they for their parts cast no stumbling blocks before others: admonishing them very severely neyther easily to take nor to give offence. And because through pride in our selves, and contempt of others we are imboldened to give offence, especially to them, in whom we behold any great infirmities, our saviour Christ proceeds to shew what great care the Lord takes for the meanest of his, and what account he makes of them, teaching them all moderation and compassion towards them in their infirmities. But least any should then say, if it be so, the best way is to let men alone in their sinnes, Christ prescribes a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12105"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=89">[Page 178]</a></span> remedy for this evill, even that golden mean, v. 15. 16. 17. that we should neyther be bitter or rigorous towards them to cause them to scandalize, nor yet so remisse, as by connivency to flatter them in their sinnes.</p><p>For the occasion of the words, &amp; the Argument taken from it,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note465">II.</span> bycause the authour puts it downe, not as he proves it to be, but <span class="hi">as it is thought,</span> I passe it by as one of the thoughts spoken of by the wise man, in the Prov. and with it the scope, which he tells vs, <span class="hi">is held to be a moderating of the Iewes passion for private iniuries offred,</span> as be­ing both together, &amp; with them the exposition also in the 4. place, as being onely so many beggings of the quaestion in hand. The sum of which exposition is (for to relate all Mr Bernards words were too tedious) that <span class="hi">if one Iew offred an other iniury, and would not satisfy him when he required it, eyther privately or with a witnes or two, the party iniured was to complayne to the Iewish Synedrion, and if that would not serve the turne, he might if he would proceed with him, and bring him before the Romayn power, and sue him at Caesars <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>arr, as if he were a publican, or heathen.</span> The reasons novv to prove this interpretation follovv. And <span class="hi">the first is because Christ spake accor­ding no the tyme, as Mat. 5. 23. 26.</span> It followes not that because Christ so spake that one tyme, and in that one place, that there­fore, he so speaks here. What is lesse forceable? 2. As Christ in that place spake <span class="hi">both ecclesiastically and civily,</span> as you expresly affirm, so, if you graunt in proportion, that he speakes here both civily for injuries, and ecclesiastically for sinnes, you speak truth enough at the least to overthrow your self.</p><p>Your second and third proofs taken from <span class="hi">Peters vnderstanding of Christ, and Christs answer againe in the parable</span> (though it were no straunge thing for Peter to vnderstand that civily, which Christ spake spiritually, nor for Christ to reply according to the present vnderstanding) do not shew that Christs speach is to be restreyned to personall iniuries: the contrary shall appeare by, and by: And the same answer may serve to the 4. and 6. Argument.</p><p>The fifth Argument is taken from the <span class="hi">propriety of speach in the text:</span> as first because Christ sayth, <span class="hi">against thee, which</span> (say you) <span class="hi">shewes the offence to be private,</span> &amp;c. I graunt it, and that Christ there fetches <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12154"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=89">[Page 179]</a></span> his beginning from private, or rather from secret offences, and sinnes, which being knowen vnto one onely, may by one be re­mitted. Your second Argument is drawne from this terme <span class="hi">bro­ther, which shewes</span> (say you) <span class="hi">that Christ meant the Iewes, whom alone both the Iewes and disciples of Christ did account brethren.</span> If Christ meant onely Iewes, what makes it matter, if the Iewes onely were brethren, that is of the Church? but it is not true you say, that onely Iewes were accounted brethren by the disciples of Christ at that time: Christ shewes that they which beleeve, and obey his words, are his, and so his disciples <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note466">Math. 12. 49. 50.</span> <span class="hi">brethren</span> as did amongst o­thers, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note467">Ioh. 4. 39. 41. 42.</span> <span class="hi">many of the Samaritans,</span> which were no Iewes, long be­fore this time. That these words <span class="hi">thou hast gayned or wonne thy bro­ther, shew an alienation of mind in the party that doth the iniurie,</span> is idle, as the former. For the alienation of mind will rather be in him that hath received the injurie, which a man may do of ignorance, self love, covetousnes, or other by regards, without any change of his affection towards the person injured: the words in truth shew, that the lost sheep is found, the sinner converted. The next words are, <span class="hi">let him be to thee, which,</span> you tell vs, <span class="hi">shewes such a Church as the offender might not regard, and so the plantiffe vnremyed might seek further.</span> If you meane by these words <span class="hi">might not regard,</span> that he might lawfully not regard it, you erre; if that he might be so wicked, as not to regard, it is no new thing for wicked per­sons to disregard the Church of Christ. Your addition of <span class="hi">dis­missing to further proceeding,</span> is your owne, and so I leave it to you. And the reason why Christ sayth, <span class="hi">let him be to thee</span> is, bycause the brother spoken to was the first and principall in the accu­sation: as vnder the law, the accuser of the false Prophet must <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note468">Deut. 13. 9.</span> <span class="hi">first haue his hand vpon him,</span> whom the rest of the people must follow in putting him to death.</p><p>The last words <span class="hi">Publican and Heathen do not declare that Christ speakes of the Iewes at that time</span> eyther onely, or civily, but serve for other purposes, as I shall presently manifest, taking Arguments from these words, as from all the rest, to prove, that Christ here speakes of sinne, and of excommunication for sinne.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12224"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=90">[Page 180]</a></span>My first Reason I draw from the cohaerence, wherein I have for­merly<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note469">I.</span> manifested, Christ speakes not of private injuries onely, but of all such scandalles, as are to be found in that streyt way to heavē: no nor of injuries at all as they hurt the outward man, but as they are sinnes, and hurt, and hinder the soul in the way of godlynes: and so by the consequence of cohaerence, (if Christs words hang one vpon an other) he speaks <span class="hi">v. 15. 16. 17.</span> of sinne and the ca­rying of it.</p><p>2.

Observe further, the very sum of Mr B. answer is, that Christ speaks not here of binding, and loosing in the office of Ministerie. So we affirm, &amp; that by two or three having this power cannot be meant two or three Ministers, considered severally from the body, which alone are not the Church for any publick administration, but the officers of the Church: but by two or three are meant the meanest cōmu­nion or societie of saints whether with officers, or without officers. And is this a sufficient answering of an adversary to bring sundry reasons to prove the very thing, which he affirmes?</p><p>Adde to all these, that where the injuries offred to Christs disci­ples,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note479">IX.</span> and such as would respect his direction, were vsually for the profession of Christ, it had been a most idle course to have com­playned eyther to the Iewish Synedrion, or Romish Magistracy, which would have added injurie to injurie.</p><p>Lastly, where Christ, v. 23. in his answer to Peters quaestion,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note480">X.</span> makes the protasis or first part of his comparison <span class="hi">the kingdom of hea­ven</span> which is the Church he shewes plainely, that all the while he hath spoken of Church affaires, and the carying of them. And thus much to prove that the Lord Iesus the King of his Church hath left in this 18. of Math▪ a rule, &amp; order for the punishment of offenders in it. But this tedious matter is not yet ended. For Mr B. marshals in eight fresh reasons, to force all the reformed Churches in the world with vs, to give over this hold of <span class="hi">Mat. 18. pag. 224. 225. 226.</span> of this his last book: the best is they are of no great strength.</p><p>The first is a bare affirmation that <span class="hi">the former exposition</span> by me con­futed <span class="hi">is true.</span></p><p>His second Reason is bycause <span class="hi">Christ hath erected no government</span> in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12457"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=91">[Page 183]</a></span> his Church; (for why he should adde <span class="hi">by publick doctrine</span> I see not, except he would insinuate, that Christ taught this point privately, and in a corner) but for this brings he no one scripture or reason: as if his bare vvord vvere enough to stablish an Idoll King in his Church, vvithout officers, or lavves.

The sum is that <span class="hi">this 18. of Mat. is no perfect rule of discipline:</span> the reasōs are bycause <span class="hi">neyther all sorts of sins are here brought in, nor all the parts of discipline here comprehended.</span> And hovv do these things appear? <span class="hi">First bycause a man is here to proceed one­ly for trespasses,</span> or as it is better turned for offences, <span class="hi">against himself, but not for sinne against God, against the Magistrate, or against an other.</span> But here you should have remembred Mr B. that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note481">1 Ioh. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 4.</span> <span class="hi">sin,</span> being <span class="hi">the trans­gression of the law,</span> is onely against God, to speak properly, and there­fore David, notwithstanding his defiling of Bath sheba, and mur­dering of Vrijah confesseth that he had <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note482">Ps. 51. 6.</span> <span class="hi">sinned against God onely.</span> But as the same transgression is so cōmitted, as man scandalizeth, or takes offence at it▪ so it is a sinne against him: whether the deed done respect God or man, yea man or beast, publick or private person, a mans self, or others in the object: and so he may forgive it after the order prescribed by Christ.

Take your own instance of murder. The Magistrate is to punish it civilly in all his subjects, whether the parties repent or no; the Church is to cen­sure it ecclesiastically in her members, yea though the Magistrate pardon or passe by it, except the parties delinquent repent, for then they are to be forgiven. And what vsurpation is here vpon the Ma­gistracy? you to suppress Gods ordinance do flatter the Magistrate, and accuse the innocent.</p><p>Next you except, that <span class="hi">this of Mat. is a rule for sinnes private, and more secret, but not for publick and open sinne.</span> You might as well say that the patterne of prayer prescribed by Christ, <span class="hi">Mat. 6.</span> is not per­fect, nor a rule for private prayer, or for things concerning our selves onely, bycause it teacheth vs to say, <span class="hi">Our father,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">forgive vs our sinnes.</span> But who knowes not, that generalls include their specialties vnder them? The Lord Iesus in teaching his disciples to say, forgive vs our sinnes ioyntly, teacheth them in the same place to ask for­givenes eyther of their own sinnes, or the sinnes of others severally, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12582"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=92">[Page 185]</a></span> as occasion serves: so in teaching here all the degrees of admoniti­on ioyntly, he implyes also the dealing in any one of them several­ly, if there be occasion. And this exposition of Mr B. can I not fitlyer resemble then to the practise of some silly pursevant, that, being sent to attach some traytour, or other malefactour dwelling in Barwick, and so to bring him to the Court, if he should meet the party by the way, would refuse to medle with him, and would say, that he was sent to Barw: to fetch him, and would eyther bring him from thence, or would let him alone. And it seems, if Mr B. might construe his cōmmission, he would so advise him. But would not common sense teach a man, that the nearer he met with the party he <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ought, the more labour were spared, and that he were to apprehend him where he found him? So where Christ sends his disciples to deal with sinne a farre off, as it were, and in the first, &amp; vtmost degree, but if it be come nearer, and be found in the 2. or 3. degree, it is to be taken where it is found. If it be secret, and yet rest betwixt the brother offēding, &amp; offended, it must there be dealt with: if it become nearer the court, and be wrought before two, or three, or more, it must there, and in that order be vndertaken, the first degree is over, and that labour spared: if it be of publick na­ture, or publikly cōmitted, the two former degrees are past, and the labour in them spared: the sin must be dealt with accordingly. And the Church eyther by information from any brother or bre­thren, or by immediate notice taken, may convent or call for the offender, that he which sinned publikly, may publiquely be rebu­led.

The words are so plaine, the order so equall, the state of the Church vnder the new testament (which is not, as before, nationall, but a particular as­sembly) so capable of such an ordinance, as that laying aside pre­judice, and politick respects, there can be nothing more playne­ly spoken or more easily vnderstood.</p><p>2. It doth no way prejudice the exposition we give, though the disciples for the present vnderstood it not: they vnderstood litle, no not touching the death and resurrection of Christ, or na­ture of his kingdome when they were at the first taught them, till eyther by their own experience, or by the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost, or some other meanes, the thinges formerly taught them were brought to their remembrance. <span class="hi">Mat.</span> 16. 21. 22. &amp; 20. 20. 21. <span class="hi">Mark.</span> 16. 14. <span class="hi">Luk.</span> 24. 20. 21. 22—25. 26. -44.

I know there was at Ierusalem a representative Church for the whole nation, of which we shall speak hereafter, but that there was such a Church representative in every synagogue, furni­shed with such power can never be concluded frō these scriptures. They rather in deed prove the contrarie. It is sayd <span class="hi">Ioh.</span> 9. 22. that the Iewes had ordeyned, that such as confessed Christ, should be dissynagogued: which words do rather interest the people in the busines then otherwise.

But it is playn Mr B. to them that do not shut their eyes, and harden their hearts against the truth: that the Church of Corinth was planted in the liberty of the gospell, and had this power of Christ to reform abuses, and to excommunicate offen­ders, without sending to Paul from one part of the world to an other, and that the Corinthians <span class="hi">Ch.</span> 5. are reproved for fayling in this duty.

And what corne doth this winde shake? Do wee make it vnlawfull for any member to informe the officers of publique enormities in the Church, that they according to their places might see reforma­tion of them? Yea if the Pastor, or other principall Officer of the Church were absent necessarily, we doubt not but it were the duety of any brother, or brethren in the like case, to entreat their help for the direction, reproofe, and reformation of the Church, for any publick enormities there done, or suffered: who might also judge, and condemne the same themselves, and for their parts, exhorting, and directing the whole Church in their publique meeting to do the like as Paul did.</p><p>Your three next Arguments to prove that tell the Church, is tell the Officers, are idle descants vpon the formes, and phra­ses of speach scraped together to fill your book with.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.89"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.89. </span></h3><p>First you affirm that <span class="hi">Christ having spoken in the third</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note495">Mr. B.</span> <span class="hi">person tell the Church when he comes to ratify the authoritie to be committed to his Apostles, turnes his speach to the</span> 2. <span class="hi">person, not saying, what it, but what you shall bind, and loose, &amp;c.</span></p><p>In so saying you give the cause, though you presently eat vp<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note496">Answ.</span> your own graunt.

Yet if Christ do speak of two or three officers of a Church, gathered together in his name, he speaks a­gainst you, where all the power of the keyes over many 1000. Churches are in the hands of two Arch-Prelates, and from them delegated and derived to their severall vnderlings.</p><p>But the truth is, that gratious promise, which Christ here layes downe, for the comfort of all his saints, you do engrosse into the hands of a few Elders. You might aswel affirme, that onely two or three officers gathered together, have a promise to be heard in their prayers, and not a communion of two or three brethren, for Christ, <span class="hi">v.</span> 19. 20. speakes principally, and expressely of prayer, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13092"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=96">[Page 193]</a></span> though with reference to the binding, and loosing of sin, which (as all other ordinances) are sanctified by prayer. The very scope of the place, and reason of the speach is this. The Lord Iesus had v: 18. enfranchised the Church, with a most excellent, and ho­nourable priveledge: now the disciples did already see with their own eyes, and were more fully taught by their Maister, that the Church should arise from small, and base beginnings, and that it was also, by reason of persequution, subject to great dissipati­on. <span class="hi">Math.</span> 7. 14. &amp; 10. 17. 18. 22. 23. &amp; 13. 31. 32. least therefore their harts should be discouraged, and they, or others, driven into suspition, that the Lord would any way neglect them, or his pro­mise towards them for their paucity, and meannes, he most grati­ously prevents, and frees them from that jealousy, &amp; telles them and all others, for their comfort, that though the Church, or assembly consist but of two or three (as such beginnings the true Church of God had and have, (though your English Church begū with a kingdome in a day) <span class="hi">Act.</span> 16. 14. 15. &amp; 17. 34. &amp; 19. 7. yet that should no way diminish their power, or prejudice the ac­complishment of his promise. And the reason hath been former­ly rendred, bycause this power for binding, &amp; loosing, being given to the fayth of Peter, depends not vpon the order of office, multi­tude of people, or dignity of person, but merely vpon the word of God. And hence is it that Christ thus gratiously descends even to <span class="hi">two or three, wheresoever assembled in his name,</span> yea though it be in a Cave, or Den of the earth: of which most gratious and ne­cessary priveledge you would bereave them.</p><p>Now in your 4. Reason out of <span class="hi">v.</span> 19, you do most ignorantly erre in the grāmaticall construction: for you make a <span class="hi">change of the person agayne,</span> where there is no change at all. Christ speakes onely in the third person, as the originall makes it plaine, though the English tongue do not so distinctly manifest it to an ignorant man. Christ sayth not, whatsoever you two shall agree of, shalbe given to them, that is to the Church, but whatsover two of you shall agree of, or consent in, they two that so agree shall obteyne it of God. Which words (Mr B.) you do most vnsufferably pervert, to the sedu­cing of the ignorant: as if Christ had sayd, if two, or three of you <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13137"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=97">[Page 194]</a></span> officers, or you two or three officers, shall agree together of a thing, whatsoever they, that is the Church shall desire, namely of the Officers (for so you expound the words) it shalbe givē them. where it is most evident that they which are to agree vpon the thing, they are to ask it, and that of God, who will give it them. And where the scripture sayth, that the brother offended (speaking indefinitely of any brother, and so of the Officers themselves) must complayn to the Church, M B. on the contrary (as if he would even beard the Lord Iesus) tells vs the Church must com­playn to the Officers.</p><p>Your 5. Reason followes with many litle ones in the womb of it, which you bring forth in order, to prove, that Christ speakes <span class="hi">here figuratively,</span> and that by the Church he means the governours.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.91"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.91. </span></h3><p>The first is. <span class="hi">It agrees with the practise of the Iewish Church frō whence</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note499">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">it is held, that the manner of governing in the Church is fetched.</span></p><p>And is this the <span class="hi">necessary</span> proof you speak of? whatsoever is so<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note500">Answ.</span> held, is so in truth.

And the ground of this re­presentation was the necessary absence of the people represented. Necessary, I call it, whether we respect the ordinance of God in­hibiting the peoples entrance into the place, where the most of these representations were made, or whether wee respect the im­possibility of the whole nations ordinarie assembling, and com­municating together.</p><p>And herevpon it comes to passe, that all other Churches since, so framed, and of such qualitie, as that they cannot ordinarily as­semble together, &amp; keep communion, haue also as their images, or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13307"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=98">[Page 196]</a></span> shadowes, their Churches representative. The catholik visible Ch: of Rome hath her visible Ch: representative, the Popes Cōsistory, or Colledge of Cardinalls, or the generall Council gathered by his au­thority. The nationall Church of Engl:, hath her nationall Church representative, the Convocation house: as have also the Provinciall and Diocesan Churches their representations, the Archbishops, &amp; Bishops Consistories. But as the bodyes of these Churches are monstrous devises of mens braynes, (there being no other Chur­ches vnder the new testament but particular assemblies) so are their shadowes, (the Churches representative) mere devises of devises.</p><p>And to apply this nearer the purpose. Since the Church now consisteth not of one nation severed from all other nations, but of particular assemblies of faithfull people, separated from all other assemblies, which like so many distinct <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note509">Act <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>0. 28. 1 Pet. 5 2. 3. 1 Cor. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 4. &amp; 11. 17. 20. &amp; 14. 23.</span> <span class="hi">flockes,</span> do ordinarily heard together, and so communicate in the word, prayer, sacraments, &amp; censures, and that where the Church grew sometimes greater by the suddayne, and extraordinary conversion of more then could well so assemble, then was there presently a dispersion of the for­mer and a multiplication of more particular assemblies. Act. 2. 41. 42. &amp; 8. 4. 5. 6. &amp; 9. 31. &amp; 14. 23. 27. &amp; 15. 22. 30. Rev. 1. 4. 11. this rases the foundation of all representative Churches, as eyther politick devises, or at the best, praeposterous imitations of the Iewish Church, and polity. For (as I have formerly sayd, and common sense teacheth it) the foundation of representation is the necessary absence of that which is represented, whether person, or thing. And so since there is no necessity, that the body of a parti­cular Church should be absent, but on the contrary a necessity, that the same be present, at and in all the publick administrations, and actions of communion in the Churches holy things, we do therefore disclaym as supersluous, and feyned, all representative Churches whatsoever.</p><p>Secondly if the outward form of Church government now be fetched from the Iewish Church, then as in that representative Ch: there was an high Preist set over the rest, in whose person, and ad­ministration, the representation of the whole Church was most eminent, so must there now be also in this representative Church <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13340"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=98">[Page 197]</a></span> one officer over the rest, and as it were their high Preist. And so the catholik representative Church of Rome hath an vniversall Bi­shop the Pope over it: the Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan, Churches representative, Nationall, Provinciall, and Diocesan Bi­shops over them. And so in all equitie should the Synodes, and Praesbyteries, accounting themselves properly Churches, or bodies Ecclesiasticall, have their Officers over them: and so there should alwayes be one, or more Ministers over the Church of Ministers, and whose charge these Synodes and Presbyteries should be, to be fed by them. And the truth is, this reason fetcht from the Iew­ish Church, as it far better fitts the Praelates in England, then the Cōsistorians, so fitts it the Papists better then eyther of them both: for there is one Bishop over the catholick visible Church (as they speak) as there was one high Preist over the whole visible Ch: then.</p><p>Adde vnto this, that if the representative Church at Ierusalem be a pattern for a representative Church vnto vs, then as there not onely hard causes were opened, &amp; declared according to the law, but also the sacrifices offred, and most solemne services performed day, by day, without the presence of the body of the Church, so now in this our representative Church consisting of the officers onely, there must be not onely the vse of the keyes for admonitiō, and excommunication, but there must also be the preaching of the word, and ministring of the sacraments, (which are our most so­lemn services) whether the people be present or no. And to ima­gine a power of Christ in the Church of the officers for the vse of one solemne ordinance out of the communion of the body, &amp; not for an other, hath no ground from the Iewish Church.</p><p>Lastly, to fetch the form of govermēt for the Church now frō the Iewish Church, were to revive <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note510">Heb. 8. 13</span> <span class="hi">the old testamēt,</span> which so long since, is <span class="hi">abrogated, and disanulled.</span> For to speak properly the old testament is nothing but that externall policy instituted by Moses in the Iu­diciall &amp; ceremoniall law, for the dispensation of the typicall king­dome and Preisthood of Christ, shadowed out by that of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note511">Heb. 5. &amp; 6.</span> <span class="hi">Melchise­deck King and Preist:</span> repraesented by the administrations of Moses, and Aaron: and after continued in the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note512">Num. 18</span> <span class="hi">Preisthood of the Levites,</span> &amp; <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note513">2 Chron. 13. 5.</span> <span class="hi">kingdome of David &amp; his sonnes,</span> till Christ, in the dispensation <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13407"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=99">[Page 198]</a></span> of those worldly, and carnall ordinances. Now as the judicialls, (which were for the government of the Congregation civily) are dead, and do not bind any civil polity, save as they were of com­mon equity: so are the ceremonialls, (which were for the Ch: polity) deadly: and may not be revived by any Church, save as a­ny of them have new life given by Christ. For though we now be made <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note514">Eph. 2. 12. and 3. 6.</span> <span class="hi">citizens of the common wealth of Israell, and one body with them,</span> yet is that in respect of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note515">Gen. 17. 7. Gal. 3. 17.</span> the everlasting <span class="hi">covenant confirmed of God with Abraham through Christ. (I wilbe thy God, and the God of thy seed) four hundred and thirty yeares before the law was given,</span> or the polity and government of the lewish, eyther church, or common wealth, in it established: and as we are the sonnes, and daughters of Abra­ham by faith, but no way in respect of those Iewish ordinances in in the old testament, or the order of dispensing them. And yet if it were graunted which you would have, that the Church govern­mēt now is to be patterned by the goverment of the Iewish church, then it would nothing avayle you for the purpose in hand. For the church officers the Preists, and Levites vnto whom <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note516">Numb. 3. 67.</span> <span class="hi">the charge of the whole Congregation, for the service of the tabernacle</span> did apperteyne, had no authority by the order of their office to inflict any cen­sure spiritually vpon the people, as had the civil Magistrates to pu­nish them bodily. The Preists and Levites were onely to enterpret the law, and in cases extraordinarily difficult, to find out the estate of the person, or thing, and to shew what in such a case the law re­quired: and if you will say, they gave judgement it was none o­therwise, then as a Physitian gives <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>dgement of the body, or state of his patient by his faculty, or skill in his art: but to sit vp­on them formally in judgement, &amp; ecclesiastically to punish them, that they might not do: neyther are they called in the scriptures <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note517">Deut. 17 9. 2 Chron. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 5. 6.</span> judges, as the civil Magistrates are.

And the scripture is, Act. 15.</p><p>1. There was no synode, or assembly of the Officers of divers Churches, but onely certayne messengers sent from the church of Antiochia, to the Church of Ierusalem about the controversy there specified.</p><p>2. Neyther the Church of Antioch which sent the messengers, nor the church at Ierusalem whether they were sent, was a repre­sentative church, consisting of Officers, much lesse of chief of­ficers onely. For first it is sayd, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 1. 2. that the brethren of An­tiochia, which <span class="hi">Ch.</span> 14. 17. are called the church, and <span class="hi">v.</span> 28. the disciples, and in this chapt. <span class="hi">v.</span> 3. the church, and <span class="hi">v.</span> 23. the bre­thren sent their messengers with Paul and Barnabas to Ierusalem: and it will most evidently appeare by whom the message was sent, if we consider to whom the answer was returned. <span class="hi">ver.</span> 30. where the messengers did not deliver the Epistle till they had assembled the multitude. And 2. it is apparant that at Ierusalem, not onely the cheif officers the Apostles, yea and inferiour officers the Elders al­so, met together about it, and sent answer, but the brethren with them. <span class="hi">v.</span> 4. 12. 22.</p><p>And these scriptures alone in this chapt. are sufficient to cha­lendge the liberty of the brethren in the discussing of publique cō ­troversies out of the hands of all officers whatsoever.</p><p>3. Paul and Barnabas, went not to Ierusalem eyther for autho­rity, or direction; for being Apostles, they had both equall im­mediate authority from Christ, and equall infallible direction frō the holy Ghost, with the rest of the Apostles. Onely they went for countenance of the truth in respect of men, and for the stop­ping the mouthes of such deceivers as pretended they were sent by the Apostles. <span class="hi">v.</span> 24.</p><p>4. Their decrees were absolutely Apostolicall, and divine scrip­ture by infallible direction from the holy Ghost, and so imposed vpon all other Churches of the Gentiles, though they had <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o delegates there, <span class="hi">ver.</span> 23. 28. <span class="hi">Ch.</span> 16. 4.</p><p>But it wilbe sayd, may not the officers of one, or many Chur­ches meet together to discusse &amp; consider of matters for the good <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13569"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=100">[Page 200]</a></span> of the Church, or Churches, and so be called a Church, Synode, or the like? I deny it not, so they infringe no order of Christ, or liberty of the brethren, they may so do, and so be called in a sense: but the quaestion now is about such a Church, as is gathered for the publick administration of admonition, excommunication, &amp; other the like ordinances of Christ, which Mr B. in his first book graunts <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note520">pag. 92.</span> <span class="hi">must be done with the knowledge of the body of the Church, &amp; and in the open assembly.</span></p><p>And here falls into handling certayn borrowed stuffe <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note521">pag. 178.</span> in Mr B. 2. book about this matter.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.92"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.92. </span></h3><p>As first, that <span class="hi">Paul called the Elders of Ephesus, and conferred with them</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note522">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">without the people,</span> Act. 20. 27. which who denyes, but they which set vp a Lord Bishop to rule alone without advising with eyther<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note523">Answer.</span> the inferiour Ministers, or people.</p><p>But that, which he addes in the next place, hath almost as ma­ny errours, as wordes in it, and that is, that <span class="hi">the Elders sate in a Cō ­sistory, with Iames their Bishop at Ierusalem, without the people, and did decree a matter, without asking their voice. Act.</span> 21. 18.</p><p>First you erre in calling it <span class="hi">a Consistory,</span> or juditiall Court, for the justification of your own: where it was onely an occasionall meeting for advise. 2. in making Iames a <span class="hi">Bishop</span> whom Christ had made an Apostle. The Elders were Bishops, Act. 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. Tit. 1. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 7. And so if you would haue held any proportion you should haue made Iames an Archbishop. 3. that you make him <span class="hi">their Bishop,</span> where Bishops, or Overseers, are set over the flock, not over the Ministers, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 20. 28. 4. And most ignorantly, where you will have Iames &amp; the Elders to make a decree for Paul, as if the Elders had authority over the Apostles (for that is the drift of your argument) or one Apostle over an other: or as if Paul were subject to Consistorian decrees. It was onely a matter of advise, that passed amongst them, as all men may see.</p><p>An other observation Mr B. hath in this place, as idle as the rest: and that is, that <span class="hi">the Elders are superiour vnto the people, bycause they are set before them, Act.</span> 15. 22. 23. where if the bould and incō ­siderate man had but read the 4. verse of the same Chapt: he should have seen the people set before the Officers: the very same alte­ration <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13639"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=100">[Page 201]</a></span> appeares <span class="hi">ver.</span> 2. &amp; 12. so if his argument was of force, two contraries might be true, which is a repugnancy in nature. Yet deny we not but the officers are above the Church, in respect of the word, and doctrine they minister, and teach: but we deny the order of Elders to be superiour to the order of saynts, since it is not an order of Maystership, but of service.</p><p>But I will from this place, Mr B. (if I be not much deceived) take a better argument to prove the cōtrary to that you say, name­ly, that the Church is an order superiour vnto the officers. And the reason is, bycause the Churches have authority to send the officers, as their messengers, v. 2. 3. 22. 32. Now they that send are ever in that respect, superiour vnto them that are sent.</p><p>That which you adde in the last place, to wit, that <span class="hi">the Apostles &amp; Elders did acquaint the people with the matter, who consented, but had no authority to make the authority of the Apostles, &amp; Elders nothing,</span> is drawn out of the same cask with the former. In which speach, there is imperfectiō, cōtradictiō, &amp; ignorance. Imperfection, wher you give the people no further liberty then to consent to the matter, being made acquainted with it. For in that it is sayd, ver: 12. that the <span class="hi">multitude kept silence</span> when they had heard Iames speak truly, &amp; suffi­ciently, and that <span class="hi">they held their peace,</span> v: 13. when they heard Paul and Barnabas speak, it shewes they had also liberty of speaking in the matter, had they seen cause. Contradictions you speak, in af­firming the people were to consent to the Elders, &amp; yet in deny­ing they could praejudice their power, &amp; authority. For howso­ever this be true for the Apostles, which were infallibly, and imme­diately directed by the H. Ghost in their determinations, vnto which all were bound absolutely to condiscend, as are all the saynts at the last day to the judgement to be passed by Christ vpon the reprobate, yet is it not so for the Elders ordinary, then, or now, which may erre, and be deceived. And so where there is liberty of consenting conditionally, and if men see cause, there is also li­berty of dissenting, vpon the contrary occasion: and so this dis­sent of the body must eyther hinder the action, or els it is a mere mockery. Ignorance it is, in the last place to make equall the au­thority of the Apostles, and Elders in this decree. For the de­cree <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13692"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=101">[Page 202]</a></span> was merely Apostolicall (to speak properly) and framed by infallible direction of the Holy Ghost, (which the Elders in them­selves considered had not) as appeareth, ver. 28. and was, and is, in the right end, and equitie of it, a part of the canonicall scrip­tures, in penning whereof the Elders had no hand: and so is im­posed vpon the Churches of the Gentiles every where, ver. 23. with whom the Elders of Ierusalem had nothing to do, but one­ly the Apostles, which were generall men: so that neyther brethrē, nor Elders did more then consent to the decree it self, &amp; that ne­cessarily, as vnto a divine oracle.</p><p>These things thus ended, I return to the Arguments in Mr Ber. first book to prove by the Ch: to be meant the cheif Officers.</p><p>The second and third whereof being but needles boasts of his former doings, I passe over.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.93"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.93. </span></h3><p>The 4: is, <span class="hi">for order sake and to prevent confusion, for that which is all</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note524">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">mens, is no m<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ns: wherevpon aryseth great carelesnes in seing vnto such things, as are all mens in publique: and by it pride, yea therevpon contention ensueth.</span></p><p>Wee do stand for the order of Christ against the confusion of<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note525">Ans.</span> Antichrist in Babylon, which is vncapable of all right order: as we also enjoy the right disposition of things, and persons in their places, which is order.

And why do you not with the Papists de­prive the multitude of the vse of the scriptures in the mother tongue, that you the carefull Clergy alone might look vnto them?

The Apostle <span class="hi">Peter,</span> Act. 1. 15. <span class="hi">&amp;c. standing vp in the middest of the disciples (which were about an hundred and twenty) spake to them about the choise of one to succeed Iudas:</span> and it is sayd, ver. 23. that <span class="hi">they,</span> that is, these brethren to whom he spake, <span class="hi">presented two:</span> as also that <span class="hi">the whole multitude,</span> Act. 6. 5. <span class="hi">pre­sented the seaven for Deacons to the twelve Apostles,</span> who are sayd, v. 2. to haue called the multitude, and to have spoken vnto them, &amp; <span class="hi">v. 6.</span> to have prayed, and layd hands on the elect Deacons. Now might not any prophane spirit take vp M. B. words, and in­sult over the holy Ghost himself, and say: what did all the disci­ples that were in the place (an hundred and twenty) present Ioseph, and Mathias? They must needs speak in presenting these two, <span class="hi">and spake they ioyntly, or all at once? this were confusion contrary to</span> 1 Cor. 14. 14. <span class="hi">did the women speak? they must not medle in Church matters,</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 34. <span class="hi">did children speak? it is impossible.</span> So for Act. 6. <span class="hi">did all the twelve Apostles speak at once,</span> v. 2. <span class="hi">and pray at once,</span> v. 6. <span class="hi">did the whole multi­tude speak ioyntly, when they presented the 7.

Now let the indifferent reader judge, what M. B. hath sayd more against vs, then any Lucian or scoffing Atheist might obiect against the spirit of God himself, and his holy pen­man the Evangelist.</p><p>Yea further, by these and the like consequences, women and children are vtterly excluded from the Church, as no parts of it.</p><p>Luke sayth, Act. 15. 22. that the <span class="hi">whole Church sent</span> messengers <span class="hi">to Antiochia,</span> and Paul 1 Cor. 14. 23. speakes of <span class="hi">the whole Chur­ches comming together in one</span> to exercise themselves in prayer, prophe­sying, and the like parts of Church communion; but children ney­ther could send messengers, nor pray, nor prophesie, nor the like, and women might not speak in the Church; and therefore both they must be <span class="hi">left out of the Church, and if one part why not an other, &amp; so till we come to the cheif of the congregation,</span> that they alone may be the Church, and all in all? &amp; as it is iust with God, that he which op­poseth the truth, should oppose himself also, so doth Mr B. in this very place intāgle himself in the same absurdities, wherin he would ensnare vs. First he affirms the Church, <span class="hi">Math. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> must be the principall of the congregation. Then Mr B. is not your congrega­tion the true Church of Christ, for the principall of your Church, namely your self, hath no power to excommunicate. And say not for shame, the Archdeacon or officiall are principalls or lesse prin­cipalls of your congregation.</p><p>Again, which is the cheif thing I desire may be observed, you say, these principalls <span class="hi">must be chosen by the rest of the Church, &amp; be their mouth, and stand for the whole.</span> And how chosen? must the whole Church speak joyntly when they chuse them? that were confusion. must women speak? that is contrary to the scriptures. Yet are they members of the congregation, and so are young youthes, childrē, and servants. I adde further, the Church you say, is two or three principall members. Well then, they two or three must speak to the party, how can he els heare? but for two or three to speak to­gether, is confusion, and contrary to the cōmaundement, 1 Cor. 14. 31. for <span class="hi">all</span> must <span class="hi">speak by one &amp; one.</span></p><p>And by this time, I hope you are ashamed of such tristing as <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13994"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=103">[Page 206]</a></span> here you vse.</p><p>I do therefore answer in few words: it is not necessary that e­very one of the people should speak to the offender, no nor of the officers neyther.

Now for children, and such as are not of yeares of discretion, God and nature dispenseth with them, as for not communicating in the Lords supper now, so vnder the law for not offering sacrifices, from which none of yeares were exempted: neyther is there respect of persons with God in the common duties of Christianity.</p><p>And for that so oft reinforced objection of <span class="hi">authority given to two or three, and therefore not to all,</span> I have answered and do, that to two, or three, and yet to all, when there are but two or three in all, as vsually comes to passe in the raysing, and dispersing of Churches.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.95"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.95. </span></h3><p>Your 6.

And I cannot more fitly resemble this exemption of one, or more officers, from the ecclesiasticall censures, vnto which one or so many brethren are subiect being in the same sinne, then to the like exemption or priveledge, springing (as it seemes) from the same root, in civill judgements, cōmonly called <span class="hi">The benefit of clergy.</span> For as by it a malefactour (if he can read <span class="hi">vt clericus,</span> as they speak, shall escape death which others do, &amp; so he should without that benefit, vndergoe: so by the benefit of clergy here, the person delinquent is freed frō the dint of the spirituall sword, the cēsure of the Church, which others do, and so he should without that priveledge, vnder­goe, as well as they. Where me thinks, it were more meet, as, that he, which can read, and so hath, or may have greater knowledge should be the more severely punished civily, so, that the officers in the Church should vndergoe (if it were to be found) an heavier cē ­sure for their sinne, as being both more scandalous, and lesse ex­cusable: And so the Lord by Moses expresly manifests his will to be, in enioyning <span class="hi">the Preist</span> a greater sacrifice <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note575">Levit. 4. 3<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>-2<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">a bullock for his sin,</span> where <span class="hi">a goat</span> (which was lesse) might serve in the like case <span class="hi">for the su<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> of one of the people.</span></p><p>And this may well serve for a seventh reason to prove that the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note576">VII.</span> officers are by the law of God lyable to as deep censures for sin, as the people, and so the Pastour, as any one of the brethren.</p><p>Yet for the further &amp; more full opening of the iniquity of those proud and popish exemptions, and exaltations of Church officers, whereof from these scriptures alledged by Mr B. and the like, they boast so much, and by which they affright, and abuse the simple people, in all places, I will breifly, as I can, lay down certayn such different respects, and relations, vnder which the officers of the Church do come, as being rightly vnderstood, &amp; iustly applyed, will give good light to the discovering of this mystery.</p><p>First then, the officers of the Church are to be considered in re­spect<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note577">I.</span> of the thing, which they minister, and that is, the word, and revealed will of God, in which regard they are infinitely above, &amp; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e15376"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=109">[Page 219]</a></span> superiour vnto all <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note578">Gal. 1. 8.</span> <span class="hi">men and angels,</span> and <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note579">2 Cor. 5. 19. 2<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">in the</span> very <span class="hi">stead of Christ, and of God</span> himself.

For the kingdome of the Lord Iesus is as glori­ous, as his preisthood, or propheticall office: and his throne is to be advanced as high, and made as conspicuous to the eyes of all, as his altar, or pulpit, that I may so speak. Now as the Preist­ly, and Propheticall offices of Christ are administred in prayer, &amp; preaching, so is his Kingly office in government. In deed if wee thought (as you do), that Christ had left his kingdom, the Church, without lawes, and officers for the government of it, or that this government were an indifferent thing alterable at the willes and pleasures of men, then wee should be as indifferent, where, or how, or by whom it were administred, as you Mr B: are.</p><p>3.

And surely there must be but one Church for the whole busines. But this course is more vnreasonable then the other, namely, that the brethren must be gathered together to be spec­tatours, whiles the officers alone sit vpon the thrones of David, to heare, and judge, excluding the brethren from all communion with them, though they be personally present. For the communi­on of the Church stands not in this, that men are present, and see and heare what is done, and receive proffite, (for so may they do which are without) but in the mutuall relation, and concur­rence of the parts, and is in this ordinance onely amongst them, which are reproved, or do reprove, at least by consent, if they see cause, which are censured, or do censure. And besides it is against common sence, that the officers should be the Church represen­tative, when the body of the Church, which they represent, is pre­sent, (as hath been formerly shewed:) &amp; to call the officers alone the Church, or assembly, (which are both one) when the people are assembled with them as necessary parts, is to call one part of the Church, the Church, excluding an other part of it.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16337"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=115">[Page 231]</a></span>If the officers alone be the Church to be told, and to admonish,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note624">VIII.</span> and judge the offender, (for there is one, and the same Church for all these) then it must follow, that if the Officers admonish, the Church also admonisheth, and on the contrary, that if the officers refuse, the Church also refuseth to admonish an offendour: but nei­ther the one, nor the other of these is true. First, the Elders ob­serving sin, may and ought to admonish the party sinning, whether the Church observ it, or no▪ yea though the whol Church be other­wise minded, yea any one of the Elders may admonish (if he see cause) both the rest of the officers, &amp; the brethren also: but this ad­monition cannot be the admonitiō of the Ch:, except we will say the Church may admonish where shee sees no sinne, yea against her will, yea which is most senseles, except she may be sayd to ad­monish her self.</p><p>The second point needs no great refutation.

The consequent of this argum: Mr B. graunts in his latter book, pag. 200. vpon Mr Smythes vrging Mat. 18. com­pared with some other scriptures much what to this purpose; but the Antecedent (as he speaks) he denyes, or rather distinguisheth of these words <span class="hi">binding and loosing</span> which he vnderstands onely to be meant of personall wrongs against a man, but not of sinnes at all against God.</p><p>But as this exposition conteyns in it two notable absurdities, the first that other men may forgive injuries or wrongs done vnto me, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16383"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=116">[Page 232]</a></span> and secondly, that <span class="hi">a communion of faithfull men</span> (for so the words are)<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note626">Luk. 12. 14</span> which is the Church, may medle with judging civile matters (as are injuries) otherwise then as they are sinns against God, at which they take offence, or scandalize: so is it evidently convinced by the text, when Christ speaks of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note627">Math. 18. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">binding and loosing in heaven,</span> whither in­juries come not, save as they are sinns against God. Yea Mr B: him­self graunts in another place of this book, viz: pag. 223. towards the end, that our saviour in this place, speaks of binding and loo­sing spiritually, and that <span class="hi">not by the power of Christ given to Ministers,</span> but to <span class="hi">cōmon Christians:</span> where he also brings sundry reasons to prove, that the binding, and loosing there spoken of, doth no way concern the Ministers, or publique Officers, but private per­sons; notoriously crossing both his first book in the persons, which he will there needs have officers, and no private men, and here pri­vate persons, and no officers▪ and his second, in the thing, which in the former place he will have merely of civil consideration, but here graunts to be meant religiously.</p><p>The next reason I take from v. 19. where mention is made by<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note628">X.</span> Christ of prayer, by which the censures there spoken of are to be sanctifyed both before, and after they be exequuted. Wherevpon I demaund, whether the brethren present with the officers, be part of the Church, to which the offender is brought, and by which he is judged, in the communion of prayer, or no? It will not be denied; thence it must follow, that they are also part of the Church in receiving, and judging of the complaint, or els that they passe in, and out, and in agayn, in respect of the commu­nion, during one and the same excercise, and the sanctification of it.</p><p>They which are <span class="hi">gathered in,</span> or into <span class="hi">the name of Christ,</span> they are the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note629">XI.</span> Church spoken of, Math. 18. and have the power of Christ for binding, and loosing, as is evident, ver. 20. Now as me thinks it should be strange to affirm, that the brethren present with the Of­ficers, are gathered in or into any other name then the name of Christ, so doth Paul (drawing this rule into practise 1 Cor. 5.) commaund, that the multitude, with the officers (by not onely Mr B. but the Iesuites confession) <span class="hi">be gathered together in, or into the</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16449"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=116">[Page 233]</a></span> <span class="hi">name of Christ,</span> and that they so gathered, do <span class="hi">by the power of Christ▪</span> deliver to Satan the offender for his humbling▪ ver. 4▪ 5▪ <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note630">XII.</span></p><p>Lastly, if the officers, without the brethren, be the Church for the censures, then are they the Church for the other publique or­dinances of prayer, preaching, sacraments, and the like, and may minister them out of the cōmunion of the body; neyther can there be any reason given why they should be▪ the Church for one so­lemn ordinance, and not for an other, for one part of the publick communion of the Church, and not for an other. And therefore in the representative Church of the Iewes at Ierusalem were not onely the hard causes opened, about which the people came to en­quire, but there were also the sacrifices offered, and other the so­lemn services performed, according to the dispensations of the times. And to make the officers the Church for one part of the power of Christ, and not for an other, for one solemn administra­tion, and not for an other, (especially having fit instruments to exequute,) is a broken course, and indeed to devide Christ from himself.</p><p>But about this something wilbe sayd, though nothing against it, and namely this. That the officers are to do in one of these or­dinances, as in an other, and the multitude no more in the one▪ then in the other<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> and that as the officers onely are to pray, preach, and administer the sacraments, and the people not to medle with these things, so in the matter of excommunication.</p><p>To this I reply sundry things.</p><p>First, if the officers alone be the Church in the censures, then<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note631">I.</span> it is not in this part of communion, as in other parts: for not the officers alone, but the brethren with them, are the Church, in pray­er, preaching, administring the sacraments and the like. And as the Church (being the body of Christ) is the most entire, and best compact of all bodyes, so is the communion in it most entyre, &amp; full amongst all the parts, so far as naturall impossibilitie▪ hin­dreth not. And therefore even children (though by nature vnca­pable of other parts of communion, wherein it is required they should be agents, or do any thing) yet do communicate in that one ordinance of baptism, in the administration wherof (as of circum­cision <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16526"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=117">[Page 234]</a></span> before times) they are merely patients, and baptized in the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost. But in other actions, and amongst other members, with whom naturall inability dis­penseth not, there is a full, perfect, and intire communion, and that as sensible, and bodily amongst all, as may be, without con­fusion. In preaching, prayer, the Lords supper, psalmes, elections, and almes, all communicate though with some difference of or­der and manner of the thing. In the first which is preaching, all communicate, one officer teacheth, and the rest both officers &amp; people are taught: in prayer one officer vtters the voice, and the rest of the Church say, Amen, &amp; so all communicate: in the Lords supper all communicate, one by giving, or administring, and all the rest by receiving with him: in singing of psalmes all commu­nicate, yea and that vocally, and together where they can all cō ­bine and concur without disorder: in elections all chuse, or are chosen: in the distribution of the almes, all eyther give or receive, and so communicate together. But now in publick admoniti­ons, and excommunications, there must be a schism, for the bo­dy of the Church is by Mr B: excluded from the communion, (yea though locally present) for all the communion passeth betwixt the parties admonishing, and admonished, excommunicating, and ex­communicated, whereof the body of the Church is neyther, but a very <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ipher, &amp; a hangby.</p><p>Secondly, there is great difference betwixt prayer, and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note632">II.</span> preaching, on the one side, and excommunication on the o­ther side, in respect of the ordering, and manner of dispen­sing those ordinances. One officer prepareth in secret, and severall from the rest for preaching, and prayer, &amp; so administreth these ordinances lawfully, as the ordinances of the Church with­out the consent, yea or foreknowledge of any one eyther brother, or officer: but it is otherwise in admonition, and excommunica­tion. The sin must be told to the Church, and they vpon know­ledge of it; must admonish the sinner, and so the excommunicati­on is publiquely to be prepared, with the foreknowledge, &amp; fore­consent, of the body, which otherwise the officers, (much lesse one officer, without the knowledge or consent of eyther other officer, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16573"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=117">[Page 235]</a></span> or people) may not minister. One officer▪ I confesse▪ may admo­nish an offender, without the consent of the Church, yea or of any other officer, be there never so many, yea he may admonish both the officers and Church: but this can in no sense be called the ad­monition of the Church▪ except wee will say one officer is the Ch: excluding both the people, and other officers, and that the church may admonish her self▪ and that against her will, which were vn­reasonable, and senseles affirmations.</p><p>Thirdly, for a kind of preaching, namely: that we call <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note633">Rom. 12. 6.</span> <span class="hi">prophe­sying,</span> (and so of prayer for the sanctifying of it) that I affirm not to be so appropriated to the ministery, but that others having re­ceived a gift there vnto, may and ought to stir vp the same, and to vse it in the Church, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note634">1 Cor. 14. 3.</span> <span class="hi">for aedification, exhortation, and comfort,</span> though not yet called into the office of ministery, as hath been in part already, and now is more fully proved by these scriptures.

Now for the better vnderstanding of this point, it must be considered, that the Church of Corinth did abound with spiri­tuall gifts, above an other Churches, both ordinary and extraor­dinary: which gifts of the spirit they did abuse too much unto fa­ction, and ambition. Wherevpon the Apostle takes occasion in the beginning of the 12. hap. and so forward, to direct them in the right vse of these giftes of God, which was the imployment of them to the aedifying of the body in love: and therfore having▪ ch▪ 13. layd down a full description, and large commendation of that grace of love, in the 14▪ ch. &amp; the beginning of it, he exhorts to prophesying, and to the study, and vse of that gift▪ which though it were not so straunge a thing, as was the suddayn gift of tongues, not which drew with it such wonder, and admiration, yet was it more profitable for the Church▪ and though a matter of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16649"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=118">[Page 236]</a></span> lesse note, yet of greater charity, which must bear sway in all our actions.</p><p>Against this scripture (though in it self most pregnant for the purpose in hand) two exceptions are taken. The one that the A­postle speaks of such persons onely, as are in office, and so of their ordinary ministeriall teaching: the other, that he speakes of such gifts, as were extraordinary, and so being ceased, that the ordinance as temporary, is ceased with them. But neyther of these rubs, must turn vs out of the way of truth, nor cause vs to forbear this most excellent, and comfortable ordinance of the Lord Iesus, wherein is to be seen, and heard the variety, and harmony of the graces of God, for <span class="hi">the aedifying of the Church,</span> v. 4. and <span class="hi">gayning of the vnbeleevers,</span> v. 24. 25.</p><p>That the Apostle in this Chapter directs the Church in the vse of extraordinary gifts is most evident, neyther will I deny, but that the officers are to guide, and order this action of prophesying, as all other publick buesinesses, yea even these wherein the▪ brethren have greatest liberty, but that he also intends the establishing of, &amp; so takes order, and gives direction for an ordinary constant exer­cise in the Church, even by men out of office, I do manifest by these reasons.</p><p>First, bycause the Apostle speaks of the manifestation of a gift,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note635">I.</span> or grace, common to all persons, as well brethren, as ministers, ordinary, as extraordinary, and that at all times, which is <span class="hi">love:</span> as also of such fruits, and effects of that gaace, as are no lesse cō ­mon to all, then the grace it self, nor of lesse continuance in the Churches of Christ, to wit of <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>dification, exhortation &amp; comfort.</span> v. 3. compared with 1 Thes. 5. 11. 14.</p><p>Secondly verse 21. he permits <span class="hi">all</span> to <span class="hi">prophesie</span> and speaks as large­ly<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note636">II.</span> of prophesying, as of <span class="hi">learning, and receiving comfort.</span></p><p>But now least any should object may women also prophesie? the Apostle prevents that obiection, and it may be reproves that dis­order amongst the Corinthians, ver: 34. by a flat inhibition, inioy­ning them expresly to keep silence in the Church, in the presence of men to whom they ought to be subiect, and to <span class="hi">learn at home of their housbands,</span> v. 35. and <span class="hi">not by teaching the m<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>, to vsurp authority</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16720"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=118">[Page 237]</a></span> <span class="hi">over them,</span> 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12. which the men in prophesying do law­fully vse.

And a very presum­ptuous sin it is in any Church, to chuse an officer, not thus tray­ned vp, and tryed. Wherevpon I conclude, that brethren, (though not in officer▪) have not their hands tyed from medling in the af­faires of the Church, especially the censures, but are bound in their places to see to, and assist in the reformation of publique scandalls, and therefore are part of the Church, to which an offender is to be complayned of▪ for onely they are bound to see reformation of the evill, to whom the complaint is to be made, where Christ sayth <span class="hi">Tell the Church.</span></p><p>It now remaynes we come to the other scripture, which Mr B. turns so lightly over, viz. 1 Cor. 5. which that wee may aright vnderstand for the present purpose two things must be considred: the one whereof is, what the Apostles scope is, and what he in­tends in that Chap: and the other what persons he interesseth in the busines, about which he deales.</p><p>The Praelates with their obedient clergy, do cōstantly affirm, that the Apostle there reprooves the Corinthi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ns for not complayning to him of the incestuous person, that he might haue censured him, and that he commaunds them (being now judged by him, as ha­ving the sole authority in his hands) to exequute his sentence vpon <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16935"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=120">[Page 240]</a></span> him; and this exposition Mr Bern. laboureth to confirm, pag. 92. 94. 98.</p><p>Wee on the contrary affirm, that the Apostle in that scripture reproveth the Church of Corinth, or them, to whom he writes, for suffring (as they did) that wicked man uncast out, and that he now wills them to discharge that duty, wherein they had formerly fay­led in excommunicating him: to which he also gives his consent, going before them, as his duty was, in judging, and withall a­vouching his presence in spirit, that is in will, and consent, since he could not be bodily present with them.

Where 2. he addes▪ that a man <span class="hi">reproving the offender, complayning of him, and seeking as he may in his place, reformation as Cloe did is not levened,</span> he colours with a few good words many fowl errours. First, that Cloe complayned of the incestuous man, which was not so: she cōplayned of the <span class="hi">contentions amongst the Corin­thians,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note650">1 Cor. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 2.</span> but that of the incestuous persō was rather brought to Paul by common fame, then otherwise. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2▪ That it is <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17036"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=120">[Page 241]</a></span> sufficient for the people, yea or the Ministers eyther to reprove an offender, &amp; so to complayn to the Bishops court of him. 3. That a man is discharged if he seek reformation as he may in his place, whereas it is first required a man have such a place, or be in such a-Church, as is capable of Gods ordinances, and wherein he may vse the meanes for reformation, which Christ hath left: other wise his very place, and standing is not of God, nor may be by him continued. La<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tly, where he sayth, that the incestuous man had not levened the Corinthians bycause Paul sayth, <span class="hi">ye are vnlevened</span> v. 7. it is an ill collection. For they were unlevened or sweet bread in their persons, that is sanctified by the spirit, but sowred or le­vened in the lump of communion, by suffering that wicked man vncensured: and the Apostles desire is, that that wicked man might be cast out of the society; that as they were severally pure, or in their persons, so the whole Church together, or masse might be pure, which before was polluted with his contagion.</p><p>4. The Corinthians had formerly been taught by Paul <span class="hi">not to</span> cōpany or be <span class="hi">cōmingled with fornicators, covetous persons,</span> &amp;c: that is▪ according to the drift of the whole Chapter, to cast them out, and so haue neyther spirituall, nor civil familiarity with them. ver. 9. &amp; here he reproves them for fayling in that duty.</p><p>5.

And it is most untruly, &amp; unconscionably affirmed by this man Pag: 92. (as I haue formerly observed) that all that can be gathered from this place, is that the censures are to be executed with the publick knowledge of them that are gathe­red together.</p><p>Now the 2. consideration is, who those persons are thus to be <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17093"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=121">[Page 242]</a></span> gathered together, upon whose shoulders the Apostle layes this du­ty of delivering to Satan, purging but, puting away, &amp; judging this wicked man.</p><p>And for this, I need no more then M B: own confession in the place before named, pag: 92. where he expresly affirmeth, that by them that there meet together, is meant the body of the Church▪ And though he, and all the world should deny it, yet would the truth of God stand: which I thus manifest.</p><p>1. They <span class="hi">among whom the fornicatour was, out of the middest of whom he was to be put, &amp; which were puffed vp, when they had rather cause of sorow­ing,</span> to them the Apostle writes, them he reproves, they were to be gathered together for the excommunicating, purging out, &amp; jud­ging the offender, v. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. And therefore the duety here enjoyned, as well concorns the brethren as the officers, except we will say, the fornicatour was onely among, and in the mid­dest of the officers, &amp; to put from amongst them, and left amongst the people still, and that the officers onely were puffed vp, when they should have sorrowed, and not the brethren with them.</p><p>2. It concerned the people as well as the Preists in the type, &amp; shadow, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note651">Exo. 12. 15, 8. 15.</span> <span class="hi">to put away leven out of their houses,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">to keep the Passeover with unlevened bread:</span> and so in the truth, and substance, to purge, and put out this leven Paul speaks of, namely the incestuous person. v. 7▪ 8.</p><p>3. The Apostle admonisheth them, that were not to be com­mingled with fornicators▪ nor to eat with them: v. 9. 10. 11. &amp; this duety, I hope, as well concerned the brethren as the officers.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note652">2<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span></p><p>4.

But as I have formerly answered the objections, forced from this scripture agaynst the truth I hold, so will I here set down one Argument or two, very pregnant, (except I be deceived) for the confirmation of it, from the same scripture, &amp; the context thereof.</p><p>1. They whom the Apostle <span class="hi">by his letter made sorry,</span> for their fay­ling<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note654">I.</span> in the casting out of the incestuous man, and that <span class="hi">with a sorrow to repentaunce,</span> manifesting it self, with great <span class="hi">indignation</span> &amp; <span class="hi">zeale,</span> they were <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> reprove, and censure him, and so did, to his reformation, and their own clearing: which that it was not the case of the offi­cers alone, but of the brethren with them, appeares in these scrip­tures. 1 Cor. 5. 1. 2. with 2 Cor. 2. 5. 6. &amp; 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.</p><p>2. Paul writes not onely to the officers, but to the brethren as<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note655">II.</span> well as to them, to <span class="hi">forgive</span> or loose, to <span class="hi">comfort &amp; confirm their love to­ward</span> the same person vpon his repentance. 2 Cor. 2, 7. 8. therein plainly witnessing, that the brethren as well as the officers, had bound, rebuked, and manifested their indignation against the sin, and the person for it.</p><p>Now this point in hand I will conclude with the observation of a practise yet continued, &amp; in use in the Church of England, which is, that persons excommunicated for notorious sinns, before they be absolved, are to do their pennance (as they call it) in the par­rish Churches, wherof they are, and there to ask the whole Church forgivenes. Now I would know of you Mr B. whether the church have power to forgive the parties sin, (as men can forgive sin) yea, or no? If you say no, you discover the shame of your Church, thus prophanely to take in vayn the name of God, and to make a mock of Christ ordinances: if you answer affirmatively, then you graunt the power of Christ to forgive, &amp; to loose sinns, &amp; so consequent­ly to reteyn, and binde them, to be in the body of the Church, for which I contend▪ The truth is, there is no such power in the pa­rish <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17239"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=122">[Page 244]</a></span> assemblies, as now they stand, they can neyther bind the sinner, nor re<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>yn his sin, be he to thē never so impenitent: or loose him, and his sin; seem his repentance vnto them never so full, and vn­feighned▪ these knots are to be tyed, and loosed, onely by the Chauncelours, or Officials singers, this power have they enclosed with hedge, and ditch, and as things are judged at their tribunal, so must the captived Church take them, and will it, nill it, receive or refuse the party accordingly.

But for Ierusalem &amp; the Church there, the case is otherwise. Touching which I desire these two Rules may be born in minde.</p><p>First that ther was that one onely visible Church vpon the face<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note687">I.</span> of the earth, tyed to one temple, altar, sacrifice, Preisthood, in one place, &amp; that no man could absolutely separate from that Church, but he must separate from the visible presence, and from all the so­lemn publique worship of God.</p><p>Secondly that the Iewish Church had not that distinct ecclesi­asticall<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note688">II.</span> ordinance of excommunication, which we now have, but that the obstinate or presumptuous offender was by bodily death to be cut of from the Lords people, the same persons namely the whole nation being both Church, and common wealth, according to that special dispensation of those times. Wherevpon it follow­eth, first, that since absolute separation from the Iewish Church was unlawfull, communion with it was lawfull: and 2. that since the Church had not the power to cast out an offender, it was no pollution vnto them to suffer him amongst them, so they dischar­ged, such other duetyes, as were inioyned them, by the Lord. But it is now otherwise: the times are altered and the dispensations of them. Every place where a companie of faithful people are gather­ed into Christs name, is mount Syon, &amp; hath the promise of Gods presence: and separation from one Church remayning vncurable may be made into another. And as separation may be from a Church, so may excommunication be of person, obstinately wic­ked. And these two Rules, rightly applyed wil (as I am perswaded) satisfie the scriptures and reasons brought by Mr. B. here and both by him, and others els where, from the old testament, and the vn­polluted <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=125">[Page 251]</a></span> cōmunion of the servants of God in the Iewish Church. The other scriptures I will breifly passe over.</p><p>Tit. 1. 15. shewes, that <span class="hi">all</span> the creatures of God are <span class="hi">pure to the pure.</span> I graunt it, and his ordinances also. But ever provided, in their lawfull, and right vse, which in a prophane and vnsanctified com­munion they are not. By your exposition Mr Bernard, a godly man might eat the Lords supper with haeretiques, excōmunicates, yea Turks or Pagans, if they would, and yet all should be pure to him. Of the 2. and 3. chap. in the Revelation, I have spoken formerly, and there proved that the Churches were polluted by the tolleration of wicked persons amongst them, and therefore reproved, neyther is it materiall, if the scriptures do not expresly tax the whole Church for connivency every time they rebuked some persons in it. It is sufficient they do it in some places, and in some Churches: there is the same reason of all, neither hath one Church priviledge above an other, or for one sin, more then an other. And this also may serve for answer to the 2. &amp; 3. of your twenty Reasons in your 2. book. Onely you must take knowledg<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note689">pag. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> 1.</span> of your▪ grosse oversight in the latter reason, where the question being of the true <span class="hi">matter of the Church,</span> you bring in <span class="hi">Noah in the old world,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">L<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t in Sodom</span> vnpolluted, as though the world, and Sodom had been true matter of the Church, &amp; Noah and Lot of the same religious communion with them. The like ignorance you shew in the 8. Reason, where you demaund why <span class="hi">the fellowship in civil society should not be polluted, as well as religious communion.</span> As though you had never read that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note690">1 Cor. 7▪ 14.</span> <span class="hi">the vnbeleeving husband is sanctified to the beleeving wife</span> for civil society, which is no way dissolved, no not though the one party be a Turk, Iew, or Atheist.

But here is the oversight, that men cōsider not, that, as God hath commaunded men to worship him, receive the sacraments, and to vse other his ordinances, so he hath also called, and separated vnto himself a Church, a communion, or fellowship of saynts, and holy ones, in &amp; amongst which those holy things are to be vsed, Psal. 147, 19. Rom. 3. 2. &amp; 9. 4. and that we are as well to look in what fellowship, and communion we receive the holy things of God▪ as what the things are we do receive. And as in the naturall body there must first be a naturall vnion of the parts with the head, and one with an other, before there can be any▪ action of naturall communion eyther between the head, and the members, or one member, and an other: so in this spirituall body▪ the Church, the members must first be vnited with Christ the head▪ and become one with him, before they can any way partake in his benefits, o<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> haue communion with him, ey­ther in the merits or vertue of his death, and obedience, Ioh. 15. 2. 4. 5.

And as no religious communion eyther private, or publick, may be held with persons iustly excōmunicated by the Church, so ney­ther with such lewd persons, as deserve excommunication, and are thereof clearly convinced, though the Church want grace to cast them out.

And how we are to avoyd per­sons incorrigibly wicked, whether Idolatours, Haeretiques, or pro­phane livers, (the common bonds of naturall, and civill society ever kept inviolated) which as they are to the Lord, so ought they to be vnto vs abominable) see these scriptures, Act. 2. 40. 47. &amp; 19. 19.

Neyther is there any reason, whither we respect the glorie of God, or our own safe­ty, or the avoyding of offence in others, or the shaming of the par­tyes why we should avoyd civil communion with any, and yet hold religious communion with them.

And lastly, if <span class="hi">the King</span> be such <span class="hi">a ruling Elder,</span> as the scriptures speak of, he is inferiour to the teaching Elders, and deserves lesse honour then they. For so the Apostle orders things. Rō. 12. 7. 8. 1 Tim. 5. 17.</p><p>Now in making your <span class="hi">Bishops, Pastours, &amp; Doctours,</span> you are dou­ble forgetfull of your self, and double injurious vnto them, and which is worse then both the rest, you sin against the Lord, &amp; his truth. For the first, in your former book you made your Bishops <span class="hi">cheif officers in the Church, and the successours of the Apostles, and Evan­gelists,</span> and here you make them <span class="hi">Pastours, and Teachers,</span> which are the lowest orders of officers, <span class="hi">that▪ Christ gave for the work of the mi­nistery.</span> Ephe. 4. 11. 2. if your Bishops be Pastours, and Tea­chers by their office, what are you, and the rest of your rank? You and they have not the same office, but you an office vnder them, and so Pastours and Teachers being the lowest order that Christ hath left in his Church, your order must needs be something vn­der the lowest, and of an others leavings then Christs. 3. in ma­king your Bishops the Pastours &amp; Teachers of the Church of En­gland, or the particular Churches in it, you lay to their charge an accusation, which they will never be able to answer at the day of the Lord, which is, their not feeding of so many thowsand sheep committed vnto them to be fedd, and taught by them. Last­ly, nothing is more vntrue, and disagreable to the word of God, then that your Provinciall, and Diocesan Bishops are the Pastours, and Teachers given by Christ to his Church. There were no other ordinary officers left or appointed by the Apostles, in the Chur­ches but such as were fixed to particular congregations, ordina­rily called Bishops or Elders, Act. 14. 23. &amp; 20. 17. 28.

But herein you deceive the simple reader in that you separate, and dis­ioyn those things, which then were, and alwayes should be ioyned together: and they are faith, and repentance. These two ioyntly did <span class="hi">Christ</span> himself preach, and <span class="hi">Iohn Baptist</span> before him, and <span class="hi">the A­postles</span> after him: and these two were preached to, and required of every one both man, and woman, which was admitted into the Church, Mat. 3. 2. 6. Mark. 1. 15. Act. 19. 4. Luke 13. 3. 5. &amp; 24. 47. Act. 2. 28. &amp; 8. 37. &amp; 19. 18. But now bycause faith, &amp; repentance are inward graces resydeing in the hart, and known to God alone, which knoweth the hart, and that the profession, and confession of them are the ordinary meanes by which these hid­den, and invisible graces are manifested, &amp; made visible vnto men, there was no cause, but they, which made this profession to men, in sincerity, so far as men could judge, should by men be deemed, and acknowledged for true members of Christ, and fit matter for <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e19561"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=135">[Page 271]</a></span> the Lords house. And so if by any other means men manifested themselves to have fayth, and holynes wrought in them (though they made neyther profession of faith, nor confession of sinnes) yet were they, (and so ought to be) intitled, and admitted to the liberties of the Church, as appeareth, Act. 10. 44. 46. 47. And vp­pon this very ground also it is, that the children of the faithfull are of the Church, and baptised, though they make no profession of faith at all, bycause the scriptures declare them to be within the gratious covenant of Gods mercy, and love, and vnder the promi­ses of the gospel, and so by vs to be reputed holy.

But that a man of a known lewd conversation, &amp; appearing still to remain in his sinne (whatsoever in word he professeth) should be received into the Church, (out of which he ought to be cast though he were one of it) or should have <span class="hi">baptism</span> administred vnto him, (which is as Mr B. rightly confirms from the scriptures, <span class="hi">the seale of the forgive­nes</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note772">pag. 119. 1<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">of sinns, of new birth, &amp; of salvation,</span>) being judged not to have the forgivenes of sinns, nor to be born a new, nor to be in the estate of salvation, were a most desperate and prophane practise, then which I know not, whither the Divel hath brought any other into the Church, more derogatory to Gods glory, or prejudiciall to mans salvation.

For the professi­on, by which the Apostles, and Apostolike Churches received mē ­bers, was voluntary, and personall, freely made by the particular persons which ioyned themselves vnto the Lord, as the scriptures by you quoted prove, as every one that readeth them, may see: but where was or is any such personall, and particular profession vsed or required of any men, or women, in the replanting of your Church after Popery?

What is this, but the Papists implicit faith, when men beleiv, as the Church beleiveth, though they know not what it is? yea and worse then it also, for as we see, and know infinite multitudes beleive, and vpon occasion professe the contrary.

But what needs all this a doe? Mr B▪ poynts vs out with the finger a mark of the true Church, most evident, and conspicuous, and like a beacon vpon an high hill, and that is, <span class="hi">the exaltation of Antichrist.</span> I had thought the Churches, and <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note805">Ex. 25. 8 2 Cor. 6. 16</span> <span class="hi">people of God</span> should have been known by his <span class="hi">dwelling among them, &amp; walking there,</span> and by Christs presence <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note806">Math. 11. 20.</span> <span class="hi">in the middest of them:</span> but I now perceive Antichrists power, presence, and exaltation is a sure signe, by which the Churches of Christ must be discerned. If any therefore desire to plant his feet in the courts of the Lords house and there to abide for ever, let him be sure to chuse such a<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note807">Rev. 1. 13.</span> Church to ioyn to, as wherein <span class="hi">Antichrist sitteth;</span> and so espeia<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>lly the Church of Rome, because he sits surest there? And it is very like this is one reason, why Mr B. is so much perswaded of the Church of England, as of a true Church, because he thinks Antichrist sitts there in a measure: and it is not impossible, but this may have been some part of the cause, why in former tymes he was so loath to leav that Church, and to ioyn to vs, (when he thought we had the truth) because he perceived we wanted that prerogative of Anti­christs seat, which England enioyes. But though this shew the ab­surdity of the opinion, yet doth it not answer the obiections. I do then answer the same in effect, which Mr B. makes his fourth Ar­gumēt: namely, that, <span class="hi">Popery, or Antichristianism begun not out of Christi­anity but in the Church of God:</span> where it did also by steppes advance it selfe into the very throne of God, &amp; of Christ: &amp; there did in tyme, and by degrees so vniversally corrupt, and confound both persons and things, as that God could no longer be sayd to dwel there, by his visible presence, and promises, but Antichrist in his stead: ha­ving destroyed the temple of the Lord, the Church, and caryed cap­tive his people, with the holy vessels into <span class="hi">Babylon</span> spirituall: as did <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e20467"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=141">[Page 281]</a></span> the civil Babyloniās the material temple, carying captive with them into Babylon civil, the holy vessels, and other appurtenances there­of, together, with a remnant of the Lords people, of which more hereafter. Onely I doe in the mean whyle except against two par­ticulars in this second Argument. The former is, that <span class="hi">Antichrist sit­ting in the temple of God</span> (viz so remayning) <span class="hi">is that head, with his body.</span> 2 Th. 2. Antichrist was not in the Apostles tyme, nor in a long tyme after, a perfit man, consisting of the head the Pope, and the body, the Hierarchy ecclesiastical, but was in the seed onely, or as an em­brie in the wombe, not perfectly framed, much lesse visibly brought forth, least of all grown to that height, as to iustle with Christ for his throne, yea to dispossesse him of it, as now he doth, and hath done a long season. Secondly it is not truely affirmed, that because there are <span class="hi">some fundamental truthes of God in doctrine, and truthes in or­dinances of Christ</span> (as you Mr B. speak) <span class="hi">held there,</span> that therefore Rome is the true Church. How should Antichrist and the Divil in him, so effectually deceive with the delusion of vanity, and errour, if he did not countenance the same with some truthes? And do you not think it possible Mr B. that any malignant, and fal<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e Churches, should vsurp some truthes and ordinances of Christ which apper­teyn not vnto them? If your argument be good, the <span class="hi">Greek Churches, the Arians, Anabaptists, Vbiquitaries,</span> yea and all the assemblyes of hae­retiques and schismatiques in the world, are true Churches of Christ; for they all reteyn many mayn truthes, and ordinances of Christ.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note808">III.</span></p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.123"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.123. </span></h3><p>The third Argument is, that <span class="hi">as the children, or infants of the ten</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note809">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">tribes in Ieroboās Apostacy were called the children of God, by circumcisiō the visible seale of Gods covenant, so may the litle ones in the Romish Church be called Christs, for that they have received true baptism.

Wherof if I my self were perswaded, I could not defend the baptism received eyther in Rome, or England, but I must withall iustify both the one, &amp; the other for the true Church of Christ.

And I am verily perswaded that Mr B. (how bold so­ever he be in his affirmations) will not say the like of all England, eyther in the beginning, or end of King Edwards, or Queen Eliza­beths reign, which the scriptures themselves here, and els where, do testify, of all Iudah: whither we respect the disposition of the people whose hearts vniversally the Lord on his part did thus af­fect; or the solemn covenant, which they on theirs, did contract, or rather renue with him. And here I do further also infer, since <span class="hi">all Iudah reioyced at the oath of the covenant, and swore vnto the Lord with all their heart, and sought him with a whole desire:</span> 2 Chr. 15. 13. and that <span class="hi">the hand of God was in Iudah, so that he gave them one heart to do the commaundement of the King, and of the rulars according to the word of the Lord:</span> Ch. 30. 12. and so at other tymes, that it is most vntruely af­firmed by Mr B. how oft soever he repeat it, that the <span class="hi">reformation of Iudah was not voluntary, but of compulsion, and of fear.</span> True it is, that the Kings of Iudah made compulsive lawes for the reformation of the people, or rather for their continuance in that reformation, to which they had voluntarily submitted; but as Mr B. ignorance is intollerable in that his seditious errour, tending indeed to the disturbance and subversion of all states civil, and ecclesiastical, that † <span class="hi">voluntarinesse is taken away by being vnder any government:</span> that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note889">Pag. 212.</span> <span class="hi">to be subiect, and ruled is an estate far from fredome:</span> and that <span class="hi">Christians loose therby christian liberty:</span> so should he here have observed a diffe­rence betwixt compulsion active, and passive, as they speak: or more playnly thus, that it is one thing for Kings, or men in authority, to require of their subiects the performance of necessary duties or the forbearance of the contrary, vpon such, and such penaltyes, and another thing for their subiects to obey them herein, for fear, and involuntarily. Many of the Kings lawes do require loyalty of all his subiects towards his maiesty, and do forbid vpon payn of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23331"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=150">[Page 299]</a></span> death al treasons, &amp; rebellions: now wil any man hereupō be so vn­advised, as to affirm, that therfore all the Kings subjects do forbear treasons and rebellions, through compulsion, and fear, and vnwil­lingly? That godly magistrates are by compulsion to represse pu­blique, &amp; notable idolatry, as also to provide that the truth of God in his ordinance, be taught, and published in their dominions, I make no doubt; it may be also, it is not vnlawfull for them by some penalty, or other, to provoke their subjects vniversally vn­to hearing for their instruction, and conversion; yea to graunt they may inflict the same vpon them, if after due teaching, they offer not themselves vnto the Church; but that any King now vpon earth is by the word of God, to draw all the people of his nation into co­venant with the Lord, (how much lesse before they be cōveniently taught) and to confirm the same by oath, and to inflict death vp­on all that refuse it, or remayn wicked▪ and vnrepentant, as the Kings of Iudah were to do by the people of that nation, can never be proved by Mr B. or any other man, how oft soever they bring in their practises for presidents. And if the Kings of Engl. should hold it their duty, as the Kings of Israel held it theirs, to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note890">Ps. 101. 8</span> <span class="hi">destroy all the wicked of the land,</span> and to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note891">2 Chr. 15. 12. 13.</span> <span class="hi">slay all that would not seek the Lord God of Israel with all their hart, and with all their soule, whether great, or small, man or woman,</span> &amp; should practise accordingly, they would be left barer of subjects, then I hope they shalbe. To these conside­rations let this be added, that when <span class="hi">David</span> the most famous King of Israel had <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note892">2 Sam. 5. 1. 2. 3. 5.</span> <span class="hi">subdued</span> the nations round about him, and made them <span class="hi">tributaries,</span> and reigned over them, he did not force them into the Church by compulsive lawes, nor take any such violēt courses, that we read of. Neyther can you shift of the matter, Mr B. by al­leadging that these nations were heathens, and infidels, and such as made no profession of religion, nor were circumcised: for a­mongst the rest over whom David ruled, the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note893">vr 14.</span> <span class="hi">Edomites</span> are named, which were the posterity of holy Abraham, as well as the Israelites, comming of Esau, as they of Iaakob: who did also (besides many mayn truthes) reteyn circumcision, and that true also, as well as the Papists reteyn true baptism; and by which they might as truely be deemed the Lords people, though in apostasie, as the Papists <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23397"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=151">[Page 300]</a></span> by the other.</p><p>To end this argument of violence in religion, to which it is very vnnaturall; neyther Hezechiah, nor Iosiah, nor any other King, ey­ther of Iudah or England had, or hath power from God to com­pel an apparant prophane person (so remayning) eyther to joyn vnto, or continue in the Church, and the Church so to receive, &amp; continue him. The Kings of Iudah as I haue shewed, were to de­stroy, and put to death all such wicked ones, and so to weed them out of the Church, by the sword, according to the dispensation of those tymes, to what end then doth Mr B. bring in them, &amp; their authority, eyther for the planting, or watering of such persons in the Church, for which purpose notwithstanding he produceth them. So for other Kings, though they be not to destroy all the wicked in their land, or nation, as not being to gather a nationall Church, so are they to vse their authority for the preserving pure of the Church, &amp; to see that wicked &amp; <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>lagitious persons be neither taken into, nor kept in the Ch: to the dishonour of God, &amp; profa­nation of his ordinances. You speak much of the reformation of your Church after Popery. There was indeed a great reformation of things in your Church, but very little, of the Church, to speak truely, and properly. The people, as I haue sayd, are the Church: and to make a reformed Church, there must be first a reformed people: and so there should haue been with you by the <span class="hi">preaching of repentance from dead works, and faith in Christ:</span> that the people (as the Lord should haue vouchsafed grace) being first fitted for, &amp; made capable of the sacraments, and other ordinances, might af­terwards have communicated in the pure vse of them: for want of which, in stead of a pure vse, there hath been, and is at this day a most prophane abuse of them, to the great dishonour of Christ, and his gospell, and to the hardening of thowsands in their im­penitencie. Others also indeavouring yet a further reformation, have sued, and do sue to Kings, and Queens, and Parliaments, for the rooting out of the Prelacy, and with it, of such other evill fruits as grow from that bitter root: and on the contrary to have the Ministery, government, and discipline of Christ set over the Pa­rishes, as they stand: the first fruit of which reformation, (if it were <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23423"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=151">[Page 301]</a></span> obteyned,) would be the further profanation of the more of Gods ordinances vpon such, as to whom they apperteyned not, and so the further provocation of his great Majesty vnto anger, and in­dignation against all such, as so practised, or consented therevn­to. Is it not strange that men in the reforming of a Church, should almost, or altogether forget the Church which is the people, or that they should labor to crown Christ a King over a people, whose Prophet he hath not first been? or to set him to rule by his law<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s, &amp; officers, over the professed subjects of Antichrist, &amp; the Divel? or is it possible that ever they should submit to the discipline of Christ, which have not first been prepared, in some measure, by his holy doctrine, &amp; taught with meek<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>es to stoop vnto his yoke? Both you Mr B: &amp; they of the other sort do tel vs oft of the refor­med Churches, and of your agreement with them. I wish to God from my very hart, that both you, and they, would compare your selves with them, in this principall point, vnto which all other are but as accessaries. They after the abolition of Popery, were esta­blished at the first, whether by a new plantation (new wee mean in respect of the present estate of Rome) or by reformation onely, as you will haue it: and are still continued, and increased by the free, voluntary, and personall profession of faith, and confession of sinnes of such men, and women, as are by the word of God, and the publishing of it, perswaded, and in some measure fore-fitted to joyn vnto them, and walk with them: and all this without any <span class="hi">com­pulsion with the fear of Iosiahs sword,</span> or <span class="hi">Hezechiahs proclamation,</span> by<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note894">pag. 246. 247.</span> which you confesse your Church to have been, in the persons of <span class="hi">King Edward &amp; Queen Elizabeth, brought back from Antichrist to the reformation</span> wherin now you stād: for which you peremptorily pro­fesse, there is <span class="hi">not required any profession of the name of Christ.</span> Let it then be considered of, and judged by all indifferent men, how it can possibly be that both the reformed Churches abroad, and the vnreformed Church of England, can be truely gathered, after the apostasie of Antichrist: the former being separated from Popety in­to covenant with the Lord, in the particular members, by volunta­ry profession of faith without compulsion; and the latter by com­pulsion, without profession of faith. Howsoever <span class="hi">government, &amp; free­dom,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23477"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=152">[Page 302]</a></span> <span class="hi">or voluntarynes,</span> be not <span class="hi">contrary</span> according to your most igno­rant affirmation; yet compulsion, and voluntarines are; and con­traries cannot stand together and be made true, no not by God himself. My hope was that (the argument of compulsion once en­ded,) I might, with good leave, have returned to the former book: but see, after so many provings, and professings of Rome a true Church, &amp; still in covenant with God, &amp; that the Churches now separating from her, were not to be gathered of such voluntaries, as in the first plantation, nor needed the preaching of the word to go before for their conversiō, but that the Magistrate might com­pel them by fear, and that so the reformation of the Church of En­gland was wrought, Mr B. now tels vs a cleane contrary tale, and that their <span class="hi">reformation</span> was <span class="hi">voluntary,</span> and <span class="hi">not constreyned,</span> and how that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note895">pag. 145.</span> came about.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.126"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.126. </span></h3><p>First, (to let passe the succession of the Church he pleads from <span class="hi">King Etheldred, King of Kent,</span> of which I haue spoken so lately, as the reader may bear mine answer in mind) that <span class="hi">the Queens Maiesty with many others, began a voluntary reformation, and that the supream power</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note896">Mr. B.</span> (as he calls it) <span class="hi">being gathered, made proclamatiō of her godly intent, which was a kind of teaching to which the people yeelded voluntarily, for any thing that any man can say to the contrary: and pag.</span> 245. <span class="hi">adioyned themselves vnto them, and that the act of the cheif doing it voluntarily, is to be ac­counted the act of all, though the inferiours come not to consent,</span> for proof of which he quoteth three scriptures, <span class="hi">Ex.</span> 19. 3. 7. 8. <span class="hi">Iosh.</span> 4. 2. 8. 2 <span class="hi">Chr.</span> 14. 2.</p><p>A solide proof; bycause the Queen did voluntarily imbrace the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note897">Answ.</span> truth in a measure, therfore the whole body of the land, whom she vrged by proclamation, and other inforcements, did voluntarily professe, and imbrace the same.

In adding further, that the <span class="hi">Queens proclamation was a kind of teaching,</span> you trifle notably: the quaestion is of such a teach­ing, as was effectuall to make a whole nation of Antichristians the week before, true Christians, and a true Church. It was in deed the onely effectuall means the people had generally: and if the Queen had proclaymed the contrary the next week, it would haue been as effectual to haue turned them to their former vomit again. Your presumption, that <span class="hi">no man can say to the contrary, but that the peo­ple yeelded voluntarily</span> to the truth, vpon the Queens proclamation is vayn, considering what the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note898">2 Cor. 9. 13.</span> <span class="hi">voluntary</span> yeeling, or <span class="hi">submission vnto the Gospel of Christ</span> is, which the scriptures commend vnto vs, in the establishing of Churches. The gospel is a supernaturall thing, and cannot possibly be yeelded vnto voluntarily by a naturall man, or perswaded, but by a supernaturall motive, which is onely it self: &amp; that by the operation of the spirit also in some measure, it cannot be vnderstood, and beleeved but by it self published, and proclay­med (as the sun is seen by it own light) much lesse can it be willed, and willingly yeelded vnto: for the will must follow the vnderstan­ding, neyther can any man will that he knowes not. Besides, the many treasons▪ and great rebellions raysed to reestablish Popery in the lād, the great good liking of the old law (as they term it) which still is found in the multitude, and the apparant hatred and perse­quution against the true profession of the gospel in any measure, (though there be ten now for one in the beginning of the Queens reign that haue atteyned to some measure of knowledge and con­science of godlynes) do confirm that which I say, viz: that the yeelding vnto the gospell in the multitude, could not be volunta­ry. The three scriptures you bring to shew, that the <span class="hi">agreement of the cheif is accounted in the case</span> of faith, and religion <span class="hi">the act of all, though the inferiours give not their consent,</span> is by you egregiously perverted; for they do all &amp; every one of them plainly prove the peoples consent. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23616"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=153">[Page 304]</a></span> The first is Exod. 19. 3. 7. 8. where v: 3. <span class="hi">the Lord</span> signifies his wil vnto <span class="hi">Moses,</span> and v: 7. <span class="hi">Moses propounds the same things vnto the Elders,</span> and v: 8. <span class="hi">all the people</span> (viz having the same things by the Elders pro­pounded to them, as Iunius vpon that place, (and so will any man of common sense) noteth, promise obedience to all the Lords com­mandements.

For first, all the true matter of the Church hath vpon it the form of the Church, and so is of the essence, and being of the Church, which for the Church to cast out, were to destroy her own essence, &amp; being. Secondly, the true matter of the Church, and true members of Christ, are the same. As <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note906">1 Cor. 3. 11.</span> <span class="hi">Christ</span> is called the <span class="hi">foundation</span> of the house, they of the Church, are the matter of the building: as he is called <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note907">Ephe. 1. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>2. 23.</span> <span class="hi">the head of his body,</span> they are his members: whom to excommunicate, is to <span class="hi">deliver vnto Sathan,</span> 1 Cor. 5. 5. whervpon I do necessarily inferre, that if to excommunicate be to deliver to Sathan, and that the Church may lawfully excommuni­cate wicked persons, and that wicked persons be true matter, and that true matter be true members of Christs body, then may the Church lawfully deliver to Satan the true members of Christs bo­dy, which I abhor to write. And though your Ordinaries Mr B. be oft tymes so liberall of the true members of Christ, as thus to de­liver them to the Divel, yet had the Ministers of Christ rather have their own members torn from their bodies, then thus to dismem­the blessed body of the Lord Iesus. The heynousnes of this fact shewes the vanity of your distinction, the errour of your opinion, and the falsity of your Church.</p><p>Lastly you do mistake the two scriptures, which you bring to prove, that <span class="hi">a man iustly excommunicate is still called a brother in the scri­ptures, and so to be held by the Church.</span></p><p>The Apostle in the former place, 2 Th. 3. 15. speaks not of a man excommunicated, no<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> worthy to be excommunicated ney­ther: but of such a person, as followes not his calling faithfully as he ought, but, being negligent in his own, is to busy in other mens matters: whom he wills the brethren to mark, and no way to countenaunce in suc<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> walking, but on the contrary to shew their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23859"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=154">[Page 311]</a></span> dislike of it, that he may see it, and be ashamed of it: and this he that reads over the chapter, shall observe (I suppose) to be the A­postles meaning. In the second place, which is, 1 Cor. 5. 11. his meaning is, not, that Christians becōming fornicators, covetous, Idolaters, and so continuing obstinate, should still be reputed bre­thren notwithstanding, but he speaks of a brother there, as Eze­chiel speaks of <span class="hi">a righteous man,</span> chapt. 18. 24. that <span class="hi">turns away from his righteousnes and commits in<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>quity, and doth according to all the abomi­nation of the wicked,</span> &amp;c. and as truely may it be affirmed, that the person Ezechiel speaks of, is still to be reputed a righteous man, as that he, of whom Paul speaks, is still to be accounted a brother. Both the Prophet, and Apostle speaks of such persons, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s were righteous, and brethren reputatively, before they did so bastardly degenerate. And is it possible, that Christ should charge his Ch: to account an obstinate offender, as an heathen and publican, Mat. 18. and that Paul should come after, and direct them to account him a brother? Besides <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note908">Math. 23 8.</span> <span class="hi">all</span> the members of the Church <span class="hi">are bre­thren:</span> and to become a member is to become a brother, and so to be excommunicated out of the Church is nothing els but to be cast out of the Churches brotherhood. Lastly, the Apostle, 1 Cor. 5. 11. names <span class="hi">idolatours</span> amongst the rest; and will you haue idola­ters your brethren, Mr B? why then did you in the former pag. ex­clude <span class="hi">Papists,</span> and pag. 108. <span class="hi">Idolatours</span> vniversally? A holy brother­hood it seems you will have, brother idolater, haeretique, and what not?</p><p>The instance you bring of <span class="hi">Symon Magus an hypocrite received by the Apostle,</span> (by the Evangelist you should say) Act. 8. makes strōg­ly against you, if it be well considered, what is written of him. For after he was discovered by Peter <span class="hi">not to have his heart right in the sight of God,</span> he was pronounced by him to have neyther part, nor fel­lowship in that busines. ver: 21. Now if Philip had discerned thus much by him at the first, do you think he would have acknow­ledged him for a partener in it? or haue given <span class="hi">the seal of the forgivenes of sinns, of new birth, and of salvation</span> (as you truely prove baptism to be pag. 119.) to such a blank? nay would be haue prophaned the Lords holy <span class="hi">things</span> vpon such a <span class="hi">dog or swyne,</span> contrary to the expresse <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e23942"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=155">[Page 308]</a></span> commaundement of Christ, Math. 7. 6. Cease Mr B. to excuse your self by accusing the holy Apostles, and Evangelists of Christ.</p><p>And herevpon I do thus argue.</p><p>They that haue no right to the holy things of God in the Ch: are not to be admitted into it, neyther is the Church gathered of such persons, rightly, and truely gathered.</p><p>But men of lewd conversation have no right to the holy things of God in the Church; and therefore the Church gathered of such persons, is not truely gathered.</p><p>The former propositiō is clear, bycause men admitted into the Church, are admitted to the participation, and cōmunion of the holy things of God in the Church. The 2. also appeareth, both by the scripture before named, where Peter pronounceth, that, such as have not their hart right with God, (which no lewd persons hav or ever had) haue no part in the holy things of God, as also by Mr Bernards own graunt, namely, that wicked persons are to be cast out of the Church. And what could there be in the world more ri­diculous, yea or wherein God were more plainly mocked, then to gather a Church of such persons, as are judged fit to be cast out of the Church? And yet for this Church-gathering (being indeed his own) Mr B: pleads both here, and every where, both in this, and his other book.</p><p>In the next place come in certayn popular similitudes, to co­lour over that rotten errour, which can by no reason, or scripture, be made sound: in number three, which I will consider in order.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note909">I.</span></p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.128"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.128. </span></h3><p><span class="hi">Two persons are lawfully marryed by publique profession and mutuall cor­ <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>nt:</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note910">Mr. B.</span> <span class="hi">now though the wise perform not her covenant, but prove vnfaithful, yet is she still a true wis<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, till the bill of divorcement be given out.</span></p><p>I graunt it: but see you not, how you take the thing for gran­ted,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note911">Answ.</span> which wee deny, namely, that your nationall Church is the true wife of Christ?

Of the termes of which compa­rison, and their proportion, wee shall speak by, and by. I do one­ly in the mean while intreat the reader to observ with me these two things. The former, that, <span class="hi">Mr B:</span> having in the beginning of his book censured vs very severely, and that with <span class="hi">D. Allisons</span> concur­ring testimony, for misapplying 1 Pet. 2. 5. to the visible Church, which sayd they, was meant of the invisible Church, here notwith­standing he interprets it of the visible Church, even as we do. The latter, that speaking of the invisible Church, and the form of it, he brings in sundry scriptures, as so to be expounded, which are ap­parantly intended of the visible Church: &amp; amongst the rest these three. Ephe. 2. 22. and 4. 4. 1 Cor. 12. 13. the last of which he himself also within a few pages following expounds as meant of<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note924">pag. 125.</span> the visible Church, and the properties thereof. Now for the com­parison betwixt the form of the invisible, and visible Church▪ wherein if Mr B. observed due proportion, and made the form of the visible Church the same visibly, externally, &amp; in respect of men, which he doth the form of the invisible Church invisibly, internal­ly, and in respect of God, and so layd down things in simple, and playn terms, the truth in the point would easily appeare, &amp; much needles labour be spared on both sides.

It is their sin of ignorance or infirmity, which (being of the invisible Church) do not, (if possibly they can) joyn themselues vnto the visible Church, there to partake in the visible ordinances: it is their sinne of hy­pocrisie, and presumption, which not being of the invisible Church; do adjoyn themselves to the visible Church, there to prophane the Lords covenant, &amp; ordinances, to which they have no right. For how can they being wicked, and vnholy, chalendge the LORD to be their GOD, that is, all hap­pines, &amp; goodnes, vnto them, which is one part of the covenant. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e24440"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=158">[Page 314]</a></span> or professe themselves to be his people, which is another part? when the Divel is their God, and their lusts; and they his, &amp; their people, and servants, to whom they obey? or what have they to do to meddle with Gods covenant, whom he expresly forbids to take it in their mouthes? It is therefore a vile &amp; profane defence, which you are driven to, Mr B: by pleading, that wicked persons are true matter of the Church, and so admitted into covenant with God, in the 2. book; that <span class="hi">obedience</span> onely <span class="hi">followes the covenant</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note930">pag. 279.</span> <span class="hi">as the fruit of it:</span> and that God requires not actuall obedience, or that wee should be actually good, or holy, before, or when we co­venant with him: but that he should make vs good; and that wee should be good, and perform actuall obedience afterward; which as it is notable Anabaptistry, and in deed the ground of that hae­resy being applyed to the covenant of the Iewish Church: so being applyed to the covenant of the Church now, it is worse then Ana­baptistry. And consider this man, he makes the sacrament of the Lords supper a ground, and part of the covenant, and yet affirms, that God for mens entering into this covenant, requires not that they should be holy, and good: and so by this deep divinity, it must needs follow, that the Lord requires not that men should be good, or holy for their partaking in the sacrament of the Lords supper.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.132"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.132. </span></h3><p>The particulars now follow, in which you place this visible vni­on, and covenant of the Lord with his people, of them with him, and of one of them with another.

The former is▪ that the profession of faith required for a peoples vniting with the Lord their God, must be made both freely, and particularly by the persons themselves so vniting. And this ap­peares both by that which you haue sayd of Gods giving, or sen­ding his word, which is his visible outstretched hand, by which he offereth reconcilation vnto men personally, and so by consequent requires that they stretch out the hand of personall profession to him: and also by the scriptures alledged by you; all which do give witnes of such a confession of faith, and sinnes, as was freely made by the persons themselves particularly, which were ioyned to the Church.

For by the same rule of proporti­on I argue thus. As they in whose hearts, sinns, and corruptions reign inwardly, are no true Christians before God, nor actuall members of Christ invisibly: so they in whose lives, and conver­sations, sinnes and corruptions reign outwardly, are no true Chri­stians before men nor members of Christ visibly. And here comes to my mind an other argument much what like this, in Mr B. <span class="hi">2.</span> book: where he will have <span class="hi">a mixt company of godly, and wicked persons to be called holy, or a company of saynts,</span> as well as <span class="hi">a person, holy, in whom there is a mixture of the spirit, and flesh.</span> But the difference is playn. In this mixt body of godly, &amp; wicked, sin reigns in some of the mem­bers but in no part of body, or faculty of soul of a person, in whom the spirit is, (though never so much flesh be mingled with it) doth sinne reign. He might as well say, the whole Church so mixt shalbe saved: for the whol man shalbe saved, by faith in Christ, notwithstanding all mixture in him.</p><p>Now the conclusion Mr B. makes, that, their <span class="hi">congregations pro­fesse Christ, as is before sayd;</span> that <span class="hi">God hath given them his holy word, and sacraments: &amp; moved the harts of all of them outwardly to receive both the one, and the other,</span> is vnproved, and vntrue.</p><p>For first, there is no one congregation in the Land whose par­ticular members made that holy profession in any measure, by &amp; according to which the Apostles did constitute and vnite visible congregations. Secondly, I deny that the Lord hath given his sa­craments to any congregation in the Land: there are very many <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e24922"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=160">[Page 319]</a></span> in the best ordered parishes, which take them without the Lords gift: as being wicked vsurpers of them, vnto which by the revea­led will of God they have no right. But here I must needs dis­cover Mr Bernards haunt, and the turning, by which in his se­cond book he vsually declines both Mr Ainsworths &amp; Mr Smyths Arguments of this nature: and that is, by telling them, that <span class="hi">all are not wicked amongst them,</span> that <span class="hi">some,</span> or <span class="hi">many haue the true knowledge of Gods word:</span> and that <span class="hi">the fear of God possesseth the hearts of many:</span> as in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note942">pag. 249. 250. &amp;c.</span> this place, that <span class="hi">God hath moved the hearts of many of the people effectu­ally,</span> and the like: and that therefore we do them wrong in <span class="hi">con­demning all for some:</span> and in denying the good their right, for o­thers default. To this I answer first that those that can be true­ly judged to fear God, are thin strewed in the best places: and not many in comparison of the rest, as is pretended, but a very small handfull: and besides, it is but casuall, and accidentall to the congregation, and nothing to the constitution of it, that there is one man truely fearing God in it. The parish must be a true vi­visible constituted Church, as well one as another, and so receive the sacraments together, whether the Lord have had any such work (as is here spoken of) in the hearts of any, or no. And 2. it must be considered, &amp; I pray the teader well to observe it, that the quaestion here betwixt Mr B. and me (and so ordinarily be­twixt him, and them) is about the congregation (which consists of all the members ioyntly) and not about some particulars cō ­sidered severally from the rest, of whom the congregation con­sists not. I am verily perswaded there are in many congrega­tions many that truely feare God: (and the Lord encrease their number, and graces) and if they were separated from the rest into visible communion, I should not doubt to account them <span class="hi">such cō ­gregations, as vnto which God had given his sacraments:</span> but take them as they are even one with the rest, in one ioynt communion, as members of one body, making all together one Church, &amp; con­gregation, so joyned at the first, and so still remayning, I deny that this Church, or congregation is the Lords people in covenaunt with him: or that he hath given vnto it his sacraments: yea or that those, which truely <span class="hi">fear God, &amp; are accepted of him</span> in their persons, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e24989"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=161">[Page 320]</a></span> have in that communion, the right, and lawfull vse of them in ma­ny particulars. They cannot take them for pawnes and pledges of Gods love, and the forgivenes of sinns, to that congregatiō, where­with they ioyn in the vse of them: nor as testimonies of true spiri­tuall love amongst the persons communicating in them: nor as notes &amp; badges of d<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>stinction, of that assembly, from all profane &amp; vnhallowed assemblies in the world. And yet are all these com­mon ends, and vses of the sacrament, as it is a communion, or cō ­mon vnion of the members with the head, and one with another mutually. Since therefore your congregations, or parish assemblies are (&amp; alwayes have been) so constituted, as that neyther the great­est part of them (being prophane) have any interest in the sacra­ments, or can have any right vse of them in their persons, nor yet the rest in their communion: it must needs follow, (except the Lord have given his sacraments to them, which can haue no right vse of them, and to whom they apperteyn not) that <span class="hi">the Lord hath</span> not <span class="hi">given his holy sacraments to your congregations.</span> And where you further adde, that <span class="hi">God hath moved the harts of all the people of your con­gregations outwardly to receive both the word, and sacraments,</span> it is one, a­mongst the rest of your bold, but bare affirmations. Are there not many thowsands amongst you that vnderstand not <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note943">Heb. 6. 1.</span> <span class="hi">the doctrine of the beginning of Christ,</span> the very first principles of christiā religiō? And hath God perswaded the harts of these to receive the word &amp; sa­cramēts in any sence? The Lord Iesus teacheth vs in the gospel that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note944">Ioh. 3. 20.</span> <span class="hi">every man that doth evill, hateth the light, neyther commeth to light, least his deeds should be reproved.</span> And yet you will haue vs beleeve, that God hath perswaded the hearts of all the evill-doers amongst you, not onely to come to the light, but also to receive it. Let your own parish Mr B: stand for instance. There were in it (to myne own knowledge) when you wrote this book, that held most blas­phemous errours touching the very Trinity; and there are at this day, (as I am certaynly informed) who are so <span class="hi">moved to receive the word,</span> as that your Church-wardens are driven to spend a great part of the Lords day in hunting them from the ale-house to the temple. And if this be your case, what is the condition of the most congregations in the Land, to which the word of God <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e25060"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=161">[Page 321]</a></span> hath not so much as been offered in any indifferent measure for the moving of their harts to receive it? The truth is, the people are drawn in the most congregations, the most of them, and ma­ny in all, by compulsive lawes, to <span class="hi">keep their Parish Church, to heare divine service, to communicate at Easter, and to receive the sacraments, and other rites:</span> as is commaunded in the communion book: but how farre the most are from having their harts thus moved, as is pretended of all, to receive the word of God, appeareth too evi­dently in that great contempt, and hatred wherein they have such amongst themselves, as do in any sinceritie eyther preach or pro­fesse the same. To these things I may further adde, that, since the Lord hath given his word and sacraments to be dispensed to no people, but by the meanes which he hath prescribed in his word▪ except the English Preisthood, and leitourgy were prescribed by the word of God, for these ministrations, even in this respect God cannot be <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ayd to have given his word, and sacraments to the con­gregations spoken of.</p><p>Now although this which hath been sayd in answer to your grounds, be sufficient to disprove the form of your Church, as you your self Mr B. rayse it, yet for your further conviction, I will adde certayn Arguments to manifest, and make playn, that wicked, and vngodly men, and women are vncapable, by the word of the Lord, of his covenaunt, and of all spirituall visible vnion with him; &amp; so consequently your congregations (gathered of such persons at the first, and of such still consisting generally, with a handfull god­ly minded scattered amongst them) to remayn vnformed, by the Lords holy covenant.

You say that men though of a lewd conversation, that is, walking in darknes, have visible fellowship, vnion, and communion with God, if they professe they beleeve in Christ, or so say; Iohn on the contrary teacheth that they which walk in darknes, have no fellowship with God, though they so say, but are lyars.

The face of your charity Mr B. is so full set towards Rome, and Papists, as no marvayl though you be so vnequall towards vs, as you are. The truth is, you are in the most streyt bond of civil society with Popish idolaters, that may be.

And here in our names you frame an obiection, the sum whereof is, that if all <span class="hi">the godly would separate from all the wicked, then there should be no wicked of the Church.</span> Vnto which you answer sundry things: but how sufficiently will appear in the particulars. First you say, <span class="hi">God commaunds not his to separate wholly from all the wicked: but from Infidels, Gentiles, Idolaters; Iewes, Turks, Papists, whose very societies are to be left as no people of God.</span></p><p>Well then, I perceive, all religious fellowship with Papists is vn­lawfull, and that their societies are no people of God. And how agrees this with your other affirmations, that <span class="hi">Rome is a true Church: Papists true Christians, though under corruptions, as it was true Iob, though vnder soars: baptism there, a true sacrament, and seal of the covenaunt;</span> &amp; yet here the societies of Papists are no people of God, that is in no co­venant with him? Or how doth this <span class="hi">separatiō</span> thus <span class="hi">wholly</span> to be made <span class="hi">from Papists</span> agree with that you write, pag. 91. of <span class="hi">ioyning in prayer</span> with such <span class="hi">Papists,</span> as though they be of the Church of Rome, <span class="hi">yet sorrow for the abhominations, and as are come out from it in their soules, the best part,</span> though not so in their bodyes?</p><p>The distinction you put between Infidels, and idolaters, and men of prophane life, wee shall consider of in due place: &amp; for your speach of <span class="hi">all the Church falling into the estate of infidelity, and so <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>dged of the Church,</span> eyther it is without sense, or I, which vnderstand it not. Now to that you adde of <span class="hi">separating from the private familia­rity of the wicked, living in the society of the godly,</span> and that, <span class="hi">if they will not be reformed, other courses are to be taken with them,</span> as their <span class="hi">sin of ob­stinacy deserves,</span> I answer these things. First, that, as there is a case, wherein private withdrawing from a brother is warrantable, name­ly, when his offence is private, and he privately obstinate, &amp; that his sinne eyther cannot be, or is not yet made publick, &amp; publique­ly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e25387"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=163">[Page 325]</a></span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>vin<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>d: so to <span class="hi">separate from men privately,</span> and that <span class="hi">onely,</span> for pu­blick offences, is a course without ground either of scripture, or rea son. You say, pag. 144. that <span class="hi">(alvin so expounds</span> 1 Cor. 5. 11. and therevpō do take an occasion to accuse our <span class="hi">practise</span> as <span class="hi">Brownisticall,</span> &amp; vs of <span class="hi">Luciferian schisme,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Pharisaicall pride.</span> As I leave your raylings to be iudged by the Lord, so do I give the reader to vnderstand, how you grossely abuse Calvins authority: who expounds that scri­pture (as all men know it is meant) of excommunicates, and of mens private cariage towards them: with which, publick separati­on is also to be joyned: I suppose you your self will not deny it. And where you speak of <span class="hi">an other course to be taken with wicked men, that wil not be reformed,</span> you should also shew what that course is, and what is to be done, if that course be not taken: but you have thought it a point of your wisdome to be silent in these things least by ope­ning them too particularly, you should discover your own shame.</p><p>The course to be taken is, the censuring of such incorrigible of­fenders by the particular congregation, whereof they are, being <span class="hi">ga­thered together in the name of Christ, by the power of Christ;</span> with which<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note958">1 Cor. 5.</span> power divine, and heavenly priviledge, he hath furnished his Chur­ches every one of them, as well as that one of Corinth; neyther doth any true Church of Christ want this power, or neglect the vse of it without sinne. And if any Church of Christ would neg­lect to vse this power against scandalous sin manifestly proved, and cōvinced, &amp; would obstinately continue (notwithstanding all good meanes vsed to the contrary) this sower leaven vnpurged out, the whole lump were levened, and with leven might not the Passeover be eaten. And as the Church, if sin do arise, is first to endeavour the casting out of the sinne by the sinners repentance, and if that will not be, in the last place to cast out the sinne, and sinner toge­ther: so if the Church do wickedly bear out, and boulster iniqui­ty amongst themselves, such as are faithfull are first to quit them­selves of that Church-sin by testifying against it, and reproving it, and in the last place to quit themselves of the Church, if it remayn incurable. Now here you bring in certayn <span class="hi">differences,</span> &amp; distincti­ons <span class="hi">of separation,</span> but without application. The first I omit as being before handled, so much as concerns the present purpose.

In the fifth, and last difference, you speak of <span class="hi">godly mens breaking society with themselves, bycause of some wicked persons.</span> To which point I answer thus much; since the L.

The same Apostle in his former Epistle to the same Co­rinthians takes occasiō from the fornicatour among them, to for­bid them the companying, or <span class="hi">commingling</span> not onely <span class="hi">with fornicators,</span> but <span class="hi">with covetous persons, Idolaters, raylers, drunkards, extortioners,</span> &amp; all other wicked men whomsoever, ch. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1. 11. so in this place, he takes occasion from their cōmunicating with Idolaters in the Idolathytes, and the vncleannes thence arising, to enjoyn them se­paration from all other vncleannes whether of persons, or things, as the whole tenour of the scripture manifesteth. More particular­ly: though the Apostle (as you would haue it) did onely forbid <span class="hi">partaking with the wicked in their evils,</span> yet even therein did he forbid all religious communion with them since their very prayers, and other sacrifices are <span class="hi">their evils:</span> wherein whylst the godly do commu­nicate with them, what do they els but acknowledge their com­mon right, and interest in those holy things? But that the Apostle in this scripture forbids communion not onely in the evill works of wicked men, but with their persons: and that he commaunds a separation not onely reall, but personall, doth appeare by these Reasons.</p><p>First, bycause the scripture hath reference to the yoaking of the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note962">I,</span> beleevers with the vnbeleevers in mariage, as the occasion of that spirituall Idolatrous mixture, which he reproves.

Your exceptious in your 2. book to this Ar­gument are insufficient. The first is, that by this exposition <span class="hi">hypo­crit<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s should not be under the covenaunt, bycause the law of God is not writ­ten in their harts.</span> But my answer is that hypocrites in respect of God and his secret, invisible, and approving will, and calling, are not of the Church, nor under the covenaunt: but in respect of men, &amp; of the revealed will of God, according to which mē must judge, all that are outwardly holy, have their sinns forgiven, and the law of God written in their harts. And to your 2. exception, namely, <span class="hi">that the place is not vnderstood barely of a member of the visible Church, but so of it, as withall he be an elect saynt,</span> I do answer, it is true you say, <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ōsidering what bare members of the visible Church you make, &amp; of what members your Church is most what made, even such as ar both bare, and empty of all grace, and appearance of grace.

It is evident that both Ieremy, and the Apostle to the Hebrewes speak of <span class="hi">the new testament,</span> or covenant of grace, whereof <span class="hi">Christ</span> is <span class="hi">the me­diatour in his own blood;</span> opposed to the <span class="hi">old testament,</span> and covenaunt of works <span class="hi">established by Moses in the blood of bulles, and goates:</span> and of the persons with whom the Lord makes this covenant, and which haue legacies in this will, and testament of Christ, which he hath also confirmed by his death: which do <span class="hi">all know God, and have his law written in their harts, and their sinns pardoned.</span> And there is no­thing more derogatory to the grace of God, and blood of Christ, then that any within the compasse of this covenant of grace, or having a portion in this testament established in Christs blood, should not haue his iniquities forgiven, and his heart sanctifyed by the spirit, truely or in appearance, as he is truely or apparantly par­taker of the former graces. And here also appears the vanity of your third exception so oft repeated by you, to wit, that you are <span class="hi">not all without the law of God written in your harts, and without the forgive­nes of sinnes,</span> but that <span class="hi">some of you</span> have obteyned this grace. As though the quaestion were of some few in your Church, &amp; not of the whole Church. If you minded what you had in hand, you should see, that to prove your Church within the covenaunt of the new testa­ment, you were bound to manifest, not that some few, but that all the members of it were (at the least in the constitution) partakers, of those promises, wherein it is established: the reason is bycause not some few severally, but all the members joyntly considered, do make the Church.</p><p>Iohn in <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1017">Chap. 9. 7. 8.</span> <span class="hi">the Revelation</span> describing <span class="hi">the Locusts,</span> sayth of them, that they had <span class="hi">faces like the faces of men, &amp; hayre like the hayre of women.</span> Doth it therefore follow they were men, or womē, bycause they had eyes, mouthes, noses, &amp; some other mēbers that men, &amp; women haue?

His errour then is in the too streyt acceptiō of the term <span class="hi">property,</span> which he should take in a larger sense, as Mr Smyth hath rightly taught him: namely that, whatsoever is pro­per vnto a person, or thing (whether within, or without) and not common to other things, or persons with him, or it, that is a pro­perty, or property of that person, or thing. And so since all the pri­viledges wherewith Christ hath endowed his Church, are proper, and peculiar vnto the Church, and not common to her with the world, it is most evident, they are all of them the Churches pro­perties, and so to be accounted, though she may for a tyme want the actuall vse of many of them. And even those <span class="hi">priviledges,</span> which your self bring for <span class="hi">instances,</span> are true properties of the Church: as <span class="hi">to be called saynts, faithful, elect: to suffer for Christ:</span> to be <span class="hi">the ark to keep the books of the covenant: to set to the seales: to vse the keyes to open, &amp; to shut heaven:</span> then which what can be more proper or peculiar vnto the Church? And it is strange that <span class="hi">sayntship, and holynes,</span> grace <span class="hi">to suffer for Christ,</span> and the like should not be accounted more natu­rall propertyes of the Church, then a prophane profession of faith and vsurpation of some ordinances of religion by lewd, and vn­godly persons.</p><p>But towching the properties of the Church by you layd down, my answer is, that except your nationall Church be that true Is­raell of God, which he hath admitted joyntly, and severally into the covenant &amp; fellowship of grace, &amp; salvation, and to whom he hath given the promises of that covenant, and to whom by his revealed will the seales, and sacraments for the confirmation of those promises, do apperteyn, the more you meddle with this co­venant by professing or publishing it, the more you take Gods name in vayn; and the more of the ordinances of God, &amp; his cove­nant, you vse, and injoy, the more you abuse, &amp; vsurp: &amp; the longer you continue in so doing, the more dangerous is your estate, &amp; the more to be bewayled.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e27148"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=172">[Page 342]</a></span>And for the things themselves by which you would haue the Ch: of Christ distinguished from all other assemblies, they are such, as may in the outward ceremony, and observation of them, without any sanctifyed vse (which is the point in controversy between me and you) both be performed, and continued in, eyther for feare, or fashion by any accursed conventicle of atheists, murderers, adul­terers or the like; yea by a company of men, and women excom­municated for these, &amp; the like trāsgressions.

In the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e27236"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=172">[Page 343]</a></span> former he endeavoured with good conscience to lay down the grounds of Christian religion: but now considering that the Chri­stian grounds there layd will not beare the Antichristian confused building, which he is to defend in his latter book, he chuseth ra­ther to rase his former Christian foundations, and to lay new, &amp; those contrary, then to leave one stone of Babell vndawbed with his vntempered morter. Now for the point it self let the reader obserue these few particulars.</p><p>First, that <span class="hi">rightly, and truely in preaching, and administration,</span> are by Mr B. very ignorantly restrayned to <span class="hi">the holy graces of the Church:</span> for which, right, and lawfull persons by, and to whom these ad­ministrations are to be made, are required. And are persons gra­ces, Mr Bernard?</p><p>2. It is not true you affirm, that all <span class="hi">divines hould</span> the true word, and true sacraments (though not truely nor rightly administred) the infallible tokens of the Church. I do not remember that ever I read this phrase <span class="hi">the true word</span> before, in any wryters. Such as write of these things are generally against you, as you are against<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1024">Art. 19.</span> the truth. Your own articles of religion condemn you, which make it a property of the Church to haue <span class="hi">the sacraments duely ad­ministred.</span> And since the word, and sacraments are di­vine ordinances instituted by the Lord for certayn ends, and purposes, and determined to circumstances of persons, as by, &amp; to whom they must be administred, it is necessary wee measure, and defyne them by the manner of ministration: otherwise wee make them but as the charmes of wizards, or at the best, as the prayers of Papists, which they account true, if so many words be sayd over by whomsoever, or howsoever. The word of God may be, and oft times is, in a great measure preached, or published vpon a stage; and what if the sacraments should be added to it, were here a true Church marked out? And as the word, and sa­craments may be sacrilegiously vsurped by them which are no Church of Christ, nor haue any right at all vnto them, so may the true Church of Christ be for a time without them, though never without spirituall right vnto them; as in the tyme of some great plague, when the Church dare not assemble, or of persequ<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tion, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e27280"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=173">[Page 344]</a></span> when it is severed eyther by bonds, or <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>light.

But what do I striving with this man, which needs none other ad­versary but himself? As he crosses his first book with his second: so doth he both crosse, and confute his second by his third. In his first, he will haue <span class="hi">the word truely taught, and the sacraments rightly administred</span> to be the marks of the true Church: in his 2. <span class="hi">the true word preached</span> though <span class="hi">not truly,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">the true sacramēts administred</span> though <span class="hi">not rightly, are in<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>allible tokens, and reciprocally converted with the Church:</span> in the 3. &amp; last book, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1025">Pag. 286</span> <span class="hi">the Church may be a Ch: without the vse of the sa­cramēts for a long tyme, as the Ch: of Israel was in the wildernes, so it be not done of contempt: and such as are eyther no Church of God at all, or an anti­christian assembly, may haue, and vsurp the seales put to a blank as Ismael, &amp; Esau out of the Church had circumcision, and the Papists now have baptism.</span> And that which he sayth of Baptism, may as truely be sayd in cases, of the word, and the publication of it by reading, and interpretation.

Mr B: as I have formerly observed, doth most vnaptly cōpare the power of casting out offenders to the faculty of seing, speaking, and the like: it is more fitly resembled to the want of power to void, and purge ex­crements, which is prodigious in nature; &amp; so neyther the naturall, nor spirituall body so constituted can possibly consist, or live. And for the parts of the body, to which he here hath reference, and the like; they do more fitly resemble the officers of the Church, then the ordinance of excōmunication: the eyes, and mouth the Bishops, and Elders, which are to <span class="hi">oversee, and teach</span> the Church: the hands, the Deacons, who are to distribute her almes. And a<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> there may be a true (though an vnperfit) naturall body without <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e27708"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=176">[Page 350]</a></span> these parts, so may there be a true visible Church, or body of Christ, without these officers, though vnperfect, and defective.</p><p>It now remayns I lay down some reasons to prove the power of the censures, &amp; of excommunication, simply necessary vnto the Church of Christ. The Reasons are,</p><p>First, bycause it is simply necessary for the being of a Church,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1044">I.</span> that there be power for true members to joyn together, and so to receive others vnto them: even so consequently must there be power to disioyn, and cut of false members.</p><p>2. Excommunication, and absolution are of the same nature<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1045">II.</span> with preaching the gospel: yea the very same, particularly applyed to persons obstinate, and repentant, which preaching is in the ge­nerall. The <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1046">Rom. 1. 16.</span> <span class="hi">preaching of the gospell is the power of God vnto salvation to every one that beleeveth:</span> excommunication is <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1047">1 Cor. 5. 4▪ 5.</span> <span class="hi">the power of the Lord Iesus Christ, for the destruction of the fl<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>sh,</span> of him that is otherwise in­corrigible, <span class="hi">that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Iesus.</span> The preaching of the gospel makes the first, or major proposition thus; <span class="hi">he that beleeves not, and repents not, is bound in heaven, and hath his sinn<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> vnremitted;</span> but he that beleeves, and repents, his sinn<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> are pardo­ned, and he loosed in heaven. Now excommunication, and ab­solution applyed to a particular person, and occasion, do make the second, or minor proposition thus: <span class="hi">thou beleevest not, or repentest not of this thy sinne, and therefore thou art bound in heaven, and thy sinnes vnpardoned:</span> and so of absolution, or the loosing of sinns. Adde al­so vnto these things, that the same Bishops, or Elders are to preach the gospel in way of doctrine, and to minister the censures in way of discipline, though in some divers order, as I haue former­ly shewed. And these two being the two mayn duties of the Mini­sters, comprehended vnder this generall duety of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1048">Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Tim. 5. 17</span> <span class="hi">feeding the stock,</span> must needs be of the same nature: both of them mayn, and necessary parts of Gods vvorship, and of religion, and so to be performed vpon the Lords day, as his work, and in the assem­bly of the saynts, as an exercise of their holy communion, howso­ever with you, and others, they are made a consistory, and working day matter, to the great violation, and indignity of the kingdom of Christ, in the dispensation of it in his Church.</p><p>3.

For some of these are not set over congregations at all, but over Provinces, &amp; Diocesse: others not in respect of their offices above named: and others, though they be set over particular Churches, yet haue they neyther gifts, nor graces for their function. But as he were nothing faythfull vnto a city, that vndertaking the defence of it, should p<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ck out here and there a corner most strong, and defensible, and fortify there, leaving the body of the city to the invasion, &amp; spoyl of any that would assault it: so neyther is Mr B: faythfull to the Mi­nistery of England, who pretending the defence of it against vs, calls out here and there a man, whom he will iustifie, and leaves the body, and all the principall members of it vndefended. And here I would demaund of him why he doth not as well defend all the Ministers, in this place, as he did even now defend all the peo­ple, or why a Minister so called, though vnapt to teach, and of a prophane life, is not as well a true, though a bad Minister: as a Christian so called, being ignorant, and of a lewd conversation, a a true, though a bad Christian? There is one and the same reason of both: though Mr B: have more reason for to plead the one then the other, considering his own standing. If he should plead for the ignorant, and prophane Ministers, he should deprive himself of all arguments for the justification of the preaching, &amp; more con­scionable sort: for he rayseth them all, as the reader may see in both his books, from their gifts, and aptnes to teach, from their holy graces, their painfull and zealous preaching, their suppres­sing of Popery, and conversion of soules, with other the like effects of the truthes of the gospel published, and taught by them: which things since he dares not affirm of the scandalous, &amp; vnpreaching Preists, he cunningly passeth them by as some small moat faln in­to the Church, by the covetousnes of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1062">2 Book p. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>90. 296.</span> <span class="hi">Much-wormly patrons,</span> but contrary to <span class="hi">the true meaning of the lawes:</span> and without the least de­fault of the Bishops, or Archbishops: as though the covetous Pa­trons could present them, except the vngodly Bishops had first or­deyned them. If he had undertaken the justification (but as true, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e27998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=177">[Page 353]</a></span> though not as good) both of the vnpreaching, and preaching Mi­nisters, he must have sought, and produced such Arguments as would haue agreed to both; but finding himself able to make no shew at all for the ignorant, idle, and scandalous sort, having no colours to paynt, no morter to dawb over those filthy stones, no not to any shew, he smothers all them, though far the greater both in number, and authority, and in deed the almost onely true for­mall ministers (according to the Church canon, and constitution) and presents to the reader a few dispersed, disgraced, tolerated, and tolerating persons, and vndertakes their defence: manifesting himself a right naturall <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1063">Rev. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> 11.</span> <span class="hi">merchant of that great whore,</span> in shewing some handfull of tolerable wares, thereby to deceive the simple buyer with the whole peice, or heap of rotten stuffe, which goes with them. Now on the contrary if Mr B. should not haue defen­ded men of lewd conversation, as true visible matter of the Church and members of Christs body, he could not haue justifyed with a­ny colour, the Nationall, Provinciall, Diocesan, and Parish Chur­ches, or any one of them, as true; since they were all at the first collected, and do still consist, for the greatest part, of such peo­ple, and so disposed.

If he haue any one of the three former qualifications, the law approves of him; and being ordeyned, the Patron may present him to any congregation in the land, whom the Bishop also must institute, the Archdeacon induct, and the people receive; and may be therevnto compelled, whither they will, or no.</p><p>Adde vnto these, that your canons, and constitutions, framed<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1066">III.</span> by the convocation house, and confirmed by the Kings royall as­sent, &amp; so being the lawes ecclesiasticall of your Church, &amp; by your doctrine Mr B. <span class="hi">the Act of all the Church, though the inferiours come not</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1067">pag. 144.</span> <span class="hi">to consent,</span> do not onely approve an vnpreaching Ministery, but al­so lay deep curses, and Anathemaes vpon all that deny eyther the truth or lawfulnes of it.

The reading of the service book, in form, and maner, the celebrating of mariage, churching of wo­men, burying of the dead, conformity, and subscription, are more essentiall to your ministery, and more necessarily requyred by the lawes of your Church both civil and ecclesiasticall, then preaching of the gospel is. The wearing of the surplice, and signing with the crosse in baptism are of absolute necessity, without partial dispen­sation, yea I may ad violation of oath by the Bishops: whereas preaching of the word is no such necessary, or essentiall duety, but a work casuall, accessory, and supererrogatory, which may be done or vndone, as the minister is able, or willing, without any such ab­solute necessity, as is here pretended. Herevpon then it followeth, that since the preaching of the gospel is no necessary part, or pro­perty of the office of ministery, in the Church of England, that that ministery cannot be of Christ: as also that the conscionable and ef­fectual preaching of some men is no iustification at all of the office, which may, and doth consist essentially without it, and to which it is but casual, &amp; accidentall; but a commendation of the persons, which, besydes the natural, and necessary parts of their office, do so practise and preach. And this consideration alone might suffice for answer vnto all Mr B. proofs for the legitimating of the mi­nistery <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28165"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=179">[Page 356]</a></span> in the Church of England: yet will I for the further disco­vering of them (considering the confidence wherwith he pro­pounds them) descend to the particulars.</p><p>In his former book he layes down, and proves by the scrip­tures these three sound, and mayn grounds touching the ministery.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1070">pag. 131.</span> 1. that <span class="hi">the Lord onely ordeyns offices in his Church.</span> 2. that <span class="hi">he distinguish­eth them one from another, that one may not intrude into an others office.</span> 3. that <span class="hi">he onely prescribes the dutyes to be done in every distinct office,</span> and so in the fourth place he comes to the qualification and gifting of men for their functions, and so proceeds to other particulars. But observe his dealings: when he comes to apply, and compare the ministery of England to, and with these golden rules, and by them generally and truely propounded, to iustify it in the particu­lars, he passeth them all by in silence, as if he had vtterly forgotten them, and speaks not one word, eyther of the <span class="hi">offices</span> themselves, or of the <span class="hi">distinction of them one from another,</span> or <span class="hi">the duties to be done in</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1071">pag. 141.</span> <span class="hi">them;</span> but comes in the very first place to the guifts, and graces of the persons. And in so doing (like the vnrighteous steward) he doth wisely, though nothing lesse then faythfully. He knowes wel, that he cannot fynd in the scriptures the least colour for the offi­ces of Archbishops, Bishops, Suffragans, Deanes, Arch-deacons, halfe Preists, or Engl: Deacons: nor that the dutyes of celebra­ting marriage, purifying women, burying the dead, reading the service book in manner, and form, are layd vpon the ministers of the gospel, as dutyes to be done in their offices: nor that the Provinciall, and Diocesan officers may intrude into their of­fice, which are set over particular congregations, and deprive them of the power of government; nor the Deacons to administer the sacramēts: nor that any of them may intrude into the office of the civil Magistrate (as they all do lesse or more) in medling with mat­ters of mariage, divorce, testaments, or with iniuryes, as they re­spect the body, or outward man, according to your, and other m<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ns exposition of Math. 18. making ministers Magistrates, and E<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ders in the Church, Elders in the gates. These things he knew, and therefore cōming to speak of the ministery in England, and to apply these general rules to their particular estate, he not so much as once mentions eyther the diversity of offices in the Church; or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28233"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=179">[Page 357]</a></span> their distinction one from another: or the several dutyes to be done in them, least in naming them, he should (as it could not have been otherwise) have condemned that thing, which he would so gladly iustify. And this I desire the Reader to note not onely a­gainst him, but specially against the Ministery he pleads for.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.151"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.151. </span></h3><p>His Arguments to prove <span class="hi">the Ministers of England: true Ministers</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1072">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">of Christ,</span> follow in order.</p><p>The first is because <span class="hi">they are not Ministers of Antichrist:</span> and that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1073">I.</span> he would prove by 4.

(had he done faithfully) should have cleared our Ar­guments, by which in sundry treatises published for that purpose, we have proved them in respect of their offices, entrances, &amp; admi­nistratiōs, the Ministers of ātichrist: but thinking it easyer to strike, then to fence, he passeth by what we have written against them, &amp; layes down certeyn colourable reasōs for them: which I have sum­marily set down in order: and vnto which I return this answer.</p><p>First and generally, that there is one common errour in all his Arguments: namely, that there is no Antichrist, but that great An­tichrist the Pope: as though there were no more Divils but <span class="hi">Beelze­bub,</span> because he is <span class="hi">the cheif of the Divils.</span> I would know of this man, what he thinks of the clergy in King Hen. 8 dayes, that took the oath of supremacy, and taught against the Pope, opposing him, &amp; being opposed by him: or what he thinks of the Lutheran Mi­nisters, that disclaym the Antichrist of Rome as haereticall, and are disclaymed by him, &amp; yet do abhor from the reformed Churches, and from al cōmunion with them, for the mayn truthes they hold, touching the sacrament, and predestination. The thing then is, that there are degrees of Antichristianism, &amp; orders of Antichrists, that is of such as are adversaries vnto Christ. In Pauls time that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1075">2 Thes. 2. 3. 4.</span> <span class="hi">man of sin, &amp; adversary</span> was got into <span class="hi">the temple of God:</span> and in Iohns time <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1076">1 Ioh. 2. 18. &amp; 4 3.</span> <span class="hi">many Antichrists were come into the world:</span> and yet there was then neyther Pope, nor masse preist; no nor Diocesan or Provinci­all Prelate neyther. There was in deed <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1077">3 Ioh. 9. 10.</span> <span class="hi">Diotrephes, who sought for</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28339"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=180">[Page 358]</a></span> <span class="hi">praeheminence,</span> &amp; to rob the Church of † <span class="hi">the power of Christ,</span> and so<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1078">1 Cor. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 4.</span> was an Antichrist, as there were many other impugning Christ the Lord otherwise: but the great Antichrist of Rome was by many degrees, and long continuance to be advanced to his throne. And as there were lesser Antichrists before him, by which he entred: so are there also after him; and those left behind him in the Church of Engl: out of which he is driven. And those are the Lord Arch bishops, and Lordbishops, with their orders, and administrations: vnto whom whilst the inferiour ministers do swear canonicall obe­dience, they do <span class="hi">by oath promise obedience vnto Antichrist,</span> and receive his <span class="hi">mark:</span> and so ministring, are the marked servants of Antichrist, whom they obey: whom they are also by doctrine to defend, ex­cept their othes, and words disagreed. From whom if any of them do withdraw this their bounden, and sworn obedience, by deny­ing subscription vnto his orders, or conformity vnto his ceremo­nies, them he silences, suspends, and deprives as schismaticall (if not hereticall), and vtterly vnworthy of their, and their Churches service. And these things the reader may apply to Mr B. 3. first se­verall Reasons.</p><p>Now to your fourth, and last Argument, viz: that you are <span class="hi">no masse-preists,</span> my answer is, first that you haue the same office with masse preists though reformed of that massing, and some other impietyes: and this both the practise of your Church, and your doctrine (pleading for succession, and ordination from Rome, &amp; Romish Bishops, do necessarily confirm. All the massepreists or­deyned in Queen Maries dayes for that end, were vpon their con­formity to the orders then, continued Ministers in their severall congregations, in Queen Elizabeths dayes, by vertue of their for­mer ordination. And so are such masse-preists at this day (though ordeyned at Rome) received and continued amongst you, vpon the aforenamed conditions. Now it is your own constant affirma­tion every where, that ordination makes the minister. Wherevp­on it followes, that no new ordination, no new minister, but the old massepreist reformed of such impieties, wherein Rome exceeds England. 2. it is your doctrine in your first book, that <span class="hi">the ministe­ry makes the Church, &amp; gives denomination vnto it:</span> &amp; in your 2. book, that the Church of Rome is a true Church: wherevpon it follo­weth necessarily, that the ministery in the Church of Rome is a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28395"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=180">[Page 359]</a></span> true Ministery: except a false ministery can make a false Church. And if any order of ministery be, it is that of the parish preists, for they are the likest the Pastours in their severall charges. Whence I do also conclude, that since the Romish preists office is a true of­fice though vnder corruptions, as it was <span class="hi">true Iob overshadowed with byles,</span> eyther the English preists must haue the same office with thē, (though with the byles cured) or els they are not the true ministers of Christ. And for the <span class="hi">name preist, at which</span> (you say) <span class="hi">we catch,</span> you do idly draw it from the Greeks, since it is most evident, that with the office, the name was tanslated vnto you from the Latine, and Romish Church: their <span class="hi">sacerdos</span> being your <span class="hi">Priest</span> in your books of ordination, and common prayer, which you haue from them: otherwise why do you not turn the Greek words <span class="hi">praesbyter, &amp; pro­istamenos,</span> preists in your English Bibles, which are translated from the originalls.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.152"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.152. </span></h3><p>The sum of the 2. Arg. is that <span class="hi">the Ministers of the Church of Engl:</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1079">II.</span> are <span class="hi">Pastours, and Teachers,</span> that is <span class="hi">good sheepheards, such as do keep,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1080">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">feed, and govern the flock;</span> and as are <span class="hi">qualified with gifts, and vnderstan­ding, and instruct them that are vnlearned.</span></p><p>If in stead of Pastours, and Teachers, you had put Parsons, &amp; <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1081">Answ.</span> Vicars, your writtes of presentation, and institution would haue proved it. But that you are Pastours, and Teachers, such as Paul speaks of Ephe. 4. by holy writ you can never manifest. 2. though the things were true you speak both for your power, and practise, yet except you administred those things by a lawfull calling, in a lawfull office, and to a lawfull assembly, you were not true Pastors, and Teachers. But it is not true you say of your selves that you <span class="hi">play the good sheepheards in feeding,</span> that is in providing pasture for the sheep, and in governing, &amp; ordering them to, &amp; fro, &amp; at it. Your Prelates govern or rather reign, but teach not: your parish Preists some of them that can, &amp; list, teach so much as they dare for feare of their imperious Lords, but govern not.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.153"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.153. </span></h3><p>Your 3. Arg: for your Ministers is, that they are <span class="hi">called &amp; sent of</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1082">III.</span> <span class="hi">God, &amp; of his Ch:, &amp; therefore are true ministers.</span> Their <span class="hi">calling, &amp; sending</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1083">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">of God</span> you make his <span class="hi">preparing of them with gifts, &amp; graces to be able to exequute in some measure the office, wherevnto he doth appoint them.</span> But herein you are greatly mistaken: the Lords inabling men<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1084">Answ.</span> with gifts is one thing, and his calling them to vse them in such, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28486"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=181">[Page 360]</a></span> and such an order, is another thing: and though the Lord calls none, but he inables them, yet he inables many, he never calls. Many counsellers, judges, lawyers, and others in the land, are ve­ry able to discharge the office of ministery, but are not called there­vnto of God; if they be, it is their sin not to obey the heavenly cal­ling, and to become ministers. And as a man may be qualified with gifts for the ministery, and yet not called of God to vse them, (so being qualified accordingly) he may be a true Minister of the Church, though he be never called of God at all, as we now speak: So was <span class="hi">Iudas,</span> who was never inwardly called of God, that is, per­swaded by the work of Gods spirit in his heart, in the zeal of Gods glory and love of the salvation of men, to take vpon him the of­fice of an Apostle. And what true calling of God the Ministers in the Church of England haue to take vpon them their offices, &amp; charges, as they do, appeares in their easy forsaking them vpon a litle persecution, yea before it come near them. Of which more hereafter.</p><p>Now for the calling of the Ministers by the Church, albeit we put of the more full handling of it to the 4. Arg. yet something must be sayd for the present.</p><p>And first, though it were true you say, that the Church of En­gland were the true Church of Christ, yet were not your Ministers called, and sent by the Church, except a Lordly Prelate be the Ch: of England, for by such a one is every Minister amongst you, cal­led, and made. 2. I deny here, (as alwayes) your nationall Ch: to be the true visible Church of Christ: and <span class="hi">that</span> which in this case, you say, is <span class="hi">largely</span> proved, I hope is sufficiently refuted.</p><p>But here a demand you make in your answer to Mr Sm: must be satisfied, namely, <span class="hi">why true ministers may not arise as well out of a false</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1085">pag. 313.</span> <span class="hi">Church, as a false ministery out of a true Ch:?</span> The latter I agree vnto: for the Church may erre, and through errour or otherwise, chuse a man uncapable of the Ministery by the word of God. Whereup­on it▪ followes, that the Minister makes not the Church (as you er­roneously affirm) for then the Church should in the very instant become a false Church when she sets vp a false Minister. But your inference I deny. For first evil may arise from good, though by ac­cident, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28537"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=181">[Page 361]</a></span> without any externall cause comming between: as sin did from the angels in heaven, and our first parents in paradise: but so cannot good from evil. 2. the officers are 1. of, 2 by, 3. in, and 4 for the Church. 1. of it, as members of the body, and so must be members of a true Church, before they can be true officers. 2. by it, in respect of their calling, as Gal. 1. 1. and therefore except they can eyther be true officers by a false calling, or that a false Church can give a true calling, they cannot be true in it. 3. in it, as the accidēts, or adjuncts in the subject, without which being true, they can have no more true existence, then reason can have, without a reasonable soul, or subject. 4. for it, and therefore since the Lord hath appointed no ministery for a false Church, there can by the word of God be no true ministery in it: and this I wish them to consider, which still adhere to the Church of England (though they wholy dislike the constitution) for the ministery in it.</p><p>Now where you adde, that <span class="hi">Luther and other worthy Ministers of Christ were raysed vp out of the Romish Church,</span> you wrong him &amp; them, and the truth in them, whilst you would gratifie Rome, and En­gland. Luthers Ministery from Rome was his Fryardome: and is a Fryar a true minister of Christ by his office, or of Artichrist whi­ther? Besides, look what ministery the Church of Rome gave him, it took from him: and lastly if he had been a true officer or mi­nister of the Church of Rome, it had been sinne in him to have left his charge. Touching the baptism received in the Romish Church I have formerly spoken; and of our reteyning it, but not our Ministery, I shall speak hereafter.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.154"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.154. </span></h3><p>That, which is worthy consideration in the fourth Argument<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1086">IIII.</span> is, <span class="hi">the enterance into the ministery: in the substance of which</span> he tells vs,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1087">Mr B.</span> <span class="hi">there is nothing wanting by their lawes.</span> For touching <span class="hi">the ability, and desyre to teach, and other graces he speaks of,</span> they no more make a mi­nister, then <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1088">Exod. 18. 21.</span> <span class="hi">courage, the feare of God, true dealing, and the hatred of of covetousnes</span> make every man a Magistrate, that is so indowed. Now this <span class="hi">entrance</span> he layes down in 4. particulars: 1. <span class="hi">presentation.</span> 2. <span class="hi">election,</span> 3. <span class="hi">probation,</span> &amp; 4. <span class="hi">ordination with imposition of hands.</span> But these in such confusion, and with so many contradictions, as do e­vidently shew what monsters an ill cause, &amp; a vayn spirit meeting <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28598"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=182">[Page 362]</a></span> together, will gender, and bring forth. First, in his former book pag. 136. he places the whole calling, (or as he speakes) <span class="hi">the ma­king of a Minister in ordination:</span> and comprehends vnder it as the 3. parts of it. 1. <span class="hi">examination:</span> 2. <span class="hi">election:</span> 3. <span class="hi">admission, with imposition of hands.</span> In his second book he makes <span class="hi">ordination</span> but the fourth, and last part of his calling, pag. 295. as in deed it is, and the same with <span class="hi">admission:</span> The reason why he would thus advance ordination is, by­cause that in Engl: is all in all, being done by a Bishop, yea though it be by the Bishop of Rome. And so they call their book they make ministers by, <span class="hi">the book of ordination</span> not the book of election, or choise, or calling of Ministers. The Bishops Lordship swallowes vp the peoples liberty: and if he but <span class="hi">lay</span> his <span class="hi">hands</span> vpon a man, &amp; bid him <span class="hi">Receive the H. Ghost,</span> he is a minister of the Church suf­ficiently ordered.</p><p>2. Where in his former book he puts <span class="hi">examination,</span> or <span class="hi">probati­on</span> before election: in his <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. he would haue election first, and the <span class="hi">probation,</span> or <span class="hi">tryal of the partyes gifts, and graces</span> to come afterwards: mis-interpreting that, which is written 1 Tim. 3. 10. of <span class="hi">probation</span> to be made before election. And the Reason of this I conceive to be, bycause the Ministers in England are not onely elected but ful­ly made, before any such tryall be taken of them. But I come to the particulars: and first to that which he calls <span class="hi">presentation:</span> for which he quotes Act. 1. 23 and 6. 6. In which scriptures, espe­cially in the latter of them, he is much mistaken: the presentation there spoken of not being before, but after <span class="hi">election.</span> The cause, I suppose, of this his confused wryting, is the confused practise in his Church, wher the Patrone presenteth his clerk both after his chu­sing, and ordeyning. But for the thing it self, (vnderstanding by presentation the nomination of the person to be chosen, or con­sidered of for choyce) as the officers are in, all other things to goe before the people, so in this ordinarily: provided alwayes the brethrens liberty be not infringed, but that they may present, or nominate others, if any amongst themselves seeme more fit.</p><p>Now for the <span class="hi">examination, and tryall of the partyes gifts, and graces,</span> as we all know what it is in the Church of England where if a man have the gift of subscription, conformity, &amp; canonical obedience, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28682"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=182">[Page 363]</a></span> though other gift, or grace he have none, he is a tryed minister, and so reputed: which if he want, be his other gifts, and graces never so eminent, he is neyther to enter into, nor being entred, to continue in his Ministery: so do the things, which you write in your <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1089">pag. 137. 138.</span> former book, touching this tryall, &amp; examination of men, before they be chosē into the Ministery, notably condemn both the ministery of your Church, which you labour to iustify, and on the contrary iustify sundry practises amongst vs, which els where you condemn for notable errours. The particulars are these. 1. First, that <span class="hi">the gifts of him that is to be chosen, must be examined according to those things, which the place wherein he must be, requireth, and God hath commaunded.</span> 2. that <span class="hi">the place or office of the Ministery consisteth principal­ly in the preaching of the word, administration of the sacraments, and pray­er.</span> 3. that <span class="hi">the first,</span> namely the preaching of the word, <span class="hi">is to be prefer­red in the first place, as being first imposed, Math.</span> 10. 28. 29. <span class="hi">and most necessary both to beget, and preserve a people. Iam.</span> 1. 18. <span class="hi">Prov.</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>9. 15. 4. that <span class="hi">the knowledge; zeale, and vtterance of of <span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span> party to be elected must be examined.</span> Whereupon these things follow. First, that, by your own graunt, men out of office may <span class="hi">preach, administer the sacraments, and prayer:</span> and so <span class="hi">exercise their gifts, and graces of knowledge, zeal, &amp; vtterance.</span> But as there is some difference, in the respect in hand, between the sacraments on the one side, and the word, and prayer on the other: bycause there is no speciall gift required for the ad­ministration of them, as there is for the latter: so is the exercise of prophesying, and prayer out of office (so much impugned by you) vndenyably iustified by this your own position. And as it is a very presumptuous evill to call any man into the office of a teaching Elder, whose gift in teaching hath not been sufficient­ly tryed out of office, so is it no lesse presumption in a Church to set a man over herself for government, of whose both ability, &amp; faithfulnes in the reproving, &amp; censuring of sinns, and in other publick affaires of the Church, she hath not taken good tryall.</p><p>2. If this be true, that <span class="hi">the office of the Ministery consist principally in the preaching of the word, and administration of the sacraments, &amp; pray­er,</span> how is that true, for which you have so much contended in the former part of your book▪ that the <span class="hi">authority to censure offenders, is in the cheif officers, and governers of the Church,</span> as their speciall pre­rogative?<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1090">pag. 94.</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28756"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=183">[Page 364]</a></span> Can a lesse principall work be the peculiar priveledge of a more principall office? It is against the light of nature, and common reason.</p><p>More particularly: this observation by you truely made, with that also which followeth, namely, that <span class="hi">the preaching of the word is to be praeferred in the first place,</span> overthrowes the order both of the Prela­cy and Preisthood of your Church. For if <span class="hi">the preaching of the gospel be the principall work of the Ministery, and to be preferred in the first place▪</span> then are not your Provinciall and Diocesan Bishops, of God, which have obteyned the principall order, and office in your Church for a lesse principall work, namely government; and are preferred to the highest, &amp; first place, not for the teaching of their Dioseces, &amp; Provinces, which were impossible, though they desired it, but for ruling of them. You say they are the successors of the Apostles: but the cheif work of the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1091">Mat. 28. 19. 20.

Rō. 1. 15. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 17.</span> Apostles Ministery was the preaching of the gospel, not ruling (much lesse Lording) wherein your Bishops of­fice standeth. The order, which the Apostle Paul hath left, is, that those <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1092">1 Tim. 5. 17.</span> <span class="hi">Elders, which labour in the word, and doctrine,</span> should have <span class="hi">speciall honour,</span> and aboue them, which are imployed in <span class="hi">ruling:</span> but this order Antichrist hath subverted, as being a course not onely too base, and laborious, but even impossible, for him to honour his Ministers by, as he desired, and hath effected; &amp; hath procured not double, &amp; treble, but an hundred fold greater honour to be a­scribed to ruling, and government, then to preaching. And this is not the least part of that confusion wherein you stand, and against which wee testify. 2. If the office of Ministery consist principally in preaching, how can your office of Ministery or order of Preisthood, be of Christ, which cōsists not at all in prea­ching, as I haue shewed, but may stand without it, by the Canons &amp; Lawes of your Church: not requiring it necessarily as any essen­tiall property for the being, but onely admitting of it, as a conve­nient ornament for the well-being: commending in deed the per­son that vseth it, but no wayes justifying the office, which requireth it not. Yea most evident it is, that the Ministery of the Church of England, considering it not onely in the state, &amp; cariage of things, but specially in the civil, and ecclesiasticall lawes wherein it is foun­ded, consists more principally in the wearing of a surplice, then in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e28812"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=183">[Page 365]</a></span> the preaching of the gospel. To conclude this point, as the ex­amination of such with you, as are to be ordeyned, by the Bishop, and his Chaplayn, is no triall of their gifts of knowledge, zeal, or vtterance, or that they are <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1093">1 Tim. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> 2.</span> <span class="hi">apt to teach,</span> but a devise like the poseing of schoolboyes, without eyther warrant fro the scriptures, or good to the Church: so the onely examination which the word of God approves of, is that just, and experimentall knowledge which the Church, by wise observation, is to take of the personall gifts, and graces of such men, as the Lord rayseth vp amongst them, manifes­ting themselves in the publick exercises of the Church in their pla­ces, as there is occasion; though you Mr Bern. be bold to abuse 1 Tim. 3. 7. to the justification of your letters testimoniall vnto the Bishop, which any vngodly person may procure from other persons as ill as himself, and thereby may find acceptance with some Bishop or other, as evill as eyther of both.

It appeareth that Paul, and Barnabas were not separated, &amp; sent by the governours onely, but by the Church with them, wher­in <span class="hi">they ministred,</span> and which joyned with them in <span class="hi">prayer, and fasting,</span> and so consequently in dismissing, or <span class="hi">letting them go,</span> ver. 2. 3. though most like the ceremony of imposition of hands was performed onely by the <span class="hi">Teachers, and Prophets,</span> but with the foregoing con­sent of the Church, according to the expresse direction of the ho­ly Ghost. And that, not the governours severally, but the Church with them, separated and sent them, vnder the Lords expresse no­mination, appears evidently, Act. 14. 27. where vpon their return▪ they made relation, not to the officers, but to the <span class="hi">Church gathered together</span> for that purpose, what things the Lord had wrought by thē, that so not onely the grace of God towards the Gentiles might be taken knowledge of, and magnified, but also that their service, &amp; ministration might be approved to the Church, which sent them.</p><p>And thus all may see how injurious this man is to the right, and liberty of the brethren, as formerly in the censures, so here in the choise of officers: making the <span class="hi">governours</span> alone <span class="hi">the Church</span> both in the one, and the other. And being both of them Church matters, and parts of the publique administration of Christs kingdom, the same scriptures which demonstrate the peoples interest in the one, do conclude the same in the other.</p><p>In the beginning, the Lord Iesus, and his Apostles by his spi­rit, appointed none other true visible Churches but particular cō ­gregations of faythfull people; (for of the vanity of representative Churches in the new testament I have formerly spoken) but as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1108">1 Cor. 8. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> <span class="hi">knowledge puffeth vp▪</span> so within a few ages, the officers and gover­nours of the Church (being men of knowledge) began to swell with that poysoned humour of pride, &amp; ambition, wherewith An­tichrist had infected them, especially when they were once setled in peace, and plenty; and taking withall, partly advantage, by the peoples negligence in themselves, and superstitious admiration of their guides; and partly occasion by the abuse of their liberty) have been bold to engrosse the liberties of the whole Church into their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e29146"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=185">[Page 368]</a></span> own hands, and with them, the name. They alone must haue the keyes of the kingdome of heaven hanging at their girdell, for the opening, &amp; shutting of heaven gates: which is all one as if in playn termes they should affirm, that to them alone were <span class="hi">committed the oracles of God, the gospel of salvation,</span> see Rom. 3. 2. Iude, 3. They a­lone must <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1109">1 Cor. 14 3.</span> <span class="hi">speak in the Church to adif<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ing, exhortation, and comfort:</span> and so all the brethren must be silenced in the exercise of prophe­cying. To them alone must the complaints of sinns be brought, and they alone must be heard in the reforming of them: and thus must the bottomles gulf of the governours authority svvallovv vp the brethrens liberty in the reproving, and censuring of offenders. They alone are to separate, and chuse the ministers: and of this branch of the povver of Christ amongst the rest, must the body of the Church be stript. And as there is no end of errours, vvhere they once begin, especially of those, vvhich tend to the advancement of <span class="hi">the man of sin</span> in his Ministers <span class="hi">above all that is called God,</span> so hath this iniquity prevayled yet further, even to the bereaving of the people of the cup in the Lords supper, and of the very scriptures in their mothers tongue: the Preists alone communicating in both parts of the supper; and inclosing the scriptures themselves vvith in the Romish, or Latine language, vvhich they alone, to speak of▪ vnderstood. Yea, to conclude, so effectuall hath the delusion of Sa­tan been this vvay, that it hath been vniversally taught, and belee­ved, that an implicite faith vvas sufficient in the lay people, &amp; that no more vvas required of them then to beleeve, as the Church (that is, the (<span class="hi">guides, and governours of the Church</span>) beleeved, though they were vtterly ignorant what their fayth was. And what lesse in effect doth M. B. affirm in his <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1110">pag. 145.</span> 2. book, where he writes, that, <span class="hi">if the cheif do voluniarily receive, professe, &amp; proclaym a faith, or religion, it is to be accounted the act of all, though the inferiours come not to consent?</span> he might as well haue added, though they be ignorant of it, or what it meanes. Yea doth not this conclusion follow vpon the former ground, that the officers are the Church. Mat. 18. for the repro­ving &amp; censuring of offenders, and for the binding, &amp; loosing of sinns? If the Officers be the Church for one religious, or spiritu­all determination, why not for an other? And if the censures agre­ed vpon and ministred by the Officers, be by way of representa­tion, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e29198"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=185">[Page 369]</a></span> the censures of the Church, without the actuall consent of the people; why is not the faith agreed vpon, and published by the officers the fayth of the Church, by way of representation, before the peoples distinct knowledge of it, or actuall consent vnto it? Put the case the officers change their auncient fayth in some mayn point, wherein the body of the Church still abideth, and so diffe­reth from them; and that they take occasion to excommunicate some brother, or brethr<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n, that most opposes them: if this excom­munication of the officers be the excōmunication of the Church representatively, without the peoples consent; then is this new faith also of the officers, for which this excommunication is practised, the faith of the people notwithstanding their not onely not con­senting vnto, but their vtter dissenting from the same.</p><p>Now as the governours did thus engrosse the power, and liber­tyes of the Church, so no marvayl, though with them, they assu­med the name.

How can the Church of England forsake the Church of Rome, and reteyn the Ministery which is in the Church, as in the subiect? especially if the Ministery make the Church, as Mr Bernard affirms: for then a true Ministery must needs make a true Church: and commu­nion with the Ministery drawes on necessarily communion with the Church. But if on the contrary he affirm, that the Church of England doth renounce the Ministery or Preisthood of the Church of Rome; then I return his demaund vpon himself, and ask him, why it reteyns the Baptism of Rome? and so leave him to himself for answer.</p><p>2. The Baptism both in England, and Rome, is in the essen­tiall causes of it, the matter, <span class="hi">water,</span> the form, <span class="hi">baptizing into the name of the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost,</span> Christs baptism, and or­dinance, though in the administration it be Antichrists de­vise: but for the Ministery eyther in Rome, or England it is o­therwise. The Ministery of Christ doth summarily, and in the substance of it, consist in the <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1227">Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 5. 1. 2.</span> <span class="hi">feeding of the flock,</span> that is, in pro­viding food for the flock, and in guiding and ordering the same accordingly; in a word, in preaching, and government, 1 Tim. 5. 17. Put what is this to the Preisthood of England, (to let passe that of Rome) vnto which preaching is not necessarily an­nexed, nor government so much as permitted? To swear Cano­nicall obedience, subscribe, conform, read the service book, ce­lebrate mariage, Church women, and bury the dead in form, &amp; order, are essentiall &amp; substantiall parts, or properties of the Mini­stery there, in the present both practise, and constitution.</p><p>The vessels of gold, and silver, which were taken out of the temple in the captivity, and caried to Babylon, and there pro­phaned, might notwithstanding (being sanctified from their prophanation there) be lawfully caried back to Ierusalem and set vp in the temple newly built, and imployed, as in former <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e31490"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=197">[Page 392]</a></span> times to Gods service: but had these vessels been broken in peices in Bab<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>lon, and there (being mingled with brasse, and iron, &amp; such b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>se mettall) been cast in another mould, they could not th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>n have ob<span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>ned th<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> former place in the temple, nor there have been <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span>d for the holy ministration.

It is essentially degenera­ted from that office of Pastourship which Christ the Lord hath set in his house for the feeding of the flock by teaching, and govern­ment, as hath been formerly shewed: and is in the true naturall, &amp; canonicall institution of it a very devised patchery, &amp; compound, like <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1228">Dan. 2. 30. 32. 33.</span> <span class="hi">the image, which the King of Babylon saw in his dream;</span> save that little, or nothing of it is <span class="hi">gold, or silver,</span> but all <span class="hi">brasse,</span> iron, &amp; clay, &amp; the like base mettall, &amp; stuffe: fitting right well both in the ad­ministration of it vnto the people, and in the subordination vnto the people, and in the subordination vnto the Prelacy, for the exaltation of the man of sinne, which hath for that very purpose devised it, and placed it in the Church for his service: that by it, as by an vnderst<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>p he might climbe up, &amp; ad­vaunce himself into the throne of iniquity, where he sitts exalted<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1229">III.</span> above all, that is called God.</p><p>3.

And as a man may justly be deposed from his Ministery, so may he in cases lawfully depose himself, and lay it down: as if by the hand of God, he be vtterly disabled from ministring, as it may come to passe, &amp; oft tymes doth: but for a man to lay down his baptism for any such infirmity, were impious, as it were sacrilegious for the Church to deprive him thereof. To these considerations I might also adde, that if a man forfeyt his Ministery, and so be deprived of it, ey­ther by deposition, or excommunication, and be afterwards vp­on his repentance judged capable of it, he must have a new cal­ling, or a confirmation at the least, answerable vnto a calling: so must it also be with him, that is translated from an inferiour of­fice to a superiour; but in baptism there may be no such chan­ging, or repetition. The practise were haereticall.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e31811"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=198">[Page 395]</a></span>Adde vnto these things, that as a man once baptized is alwayes baptized, so is he in all places, and Churches where he comes (as a baptized person) to enjoy the cōmon benefits of his baptism, &amp; to discharge the cōmon duties, which depend vpon it.

The Arguments I vvill take vp as Mr Bernard together with their answers layes them downe in his 2. book.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1287">Pag: 186. 187. 188 &amp;c.</span></p><p>Of the first Argument, I have spoken in another place. The 2. is, that if Christs ministeriall power be by succession, to the Pope, Bishops, or Praesbytery, then the Ministery of Rome is a true Mi­nistery▪ Mr Bern: answer is, that he <span class="hi">meanes true succession, which is both personall, and hath with it a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, and prayer, about which Christs true ministers are exercised:</span> but for <span class="hi">the Romish Ministery</span> it <span class="hi">is idolatry, and superstition, and the men appointed there to or­deyned sacrifising Preists.</span></p><p>This answer of yours Mr B. puts me in mind of a practise of chil­dren, who when they have a long while busyed themselves in draw­ing the best formes, and figures they can in dust, and ashes, do at the last with one dash of their hand deface all, &amp; vndo, what they haue formerly done. And that this childish dealing you use, no rea­der that considers the quaestion in hand, can be ignorant of.</p><p>The quaestion then between him, &amp; me, is not of such a <span class="hi">succession personall,</span> as hath joyned with it <span class="hi">successiō in a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, &amp; prayer,</span> wherin the minister is in any measure faithfully <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e32739"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=203">[Page 405]</a></span> exercised: but generally, whether succession of persons be of such absolute necessity, as that no minister can in any case be made but by a minister, &amp; more specially, whither the first ministers of the re­formed Ch:, or of such, as come out of the confusiō of Antichrist, must of necessity be ordeyned by the Pope, &amp; his Bishops, or mi­nister by vertue of their ordinatiō so received. And that this succes­sion by, &amp; from the Romish ministery, is that Mr Ber: pleads for, his writings manifest: as first, that, as in <span class="hi">all the Apostles time the Mini­stery</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1288">2. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ok op<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>g 185. 186.</span> <span class="hi">was by succession; ministers, as it were, begetting Ministers by ordina­tion, so after their tyme the like succession hath been kept frō tyme to tyme, Bi­shop after Bishop, and Ministers ordeyned by them: which the Catalogue of thē, &amp; stories of tymes, on which we must rely, where the script: cease to make further relation, do witnesse:</span> for the continuation of which succession <span class="hi">to the worlds end,</span> he alledgeth Math. 28. 20. odiously perverting to the Pope, and his shavelings, the promise, which Christ there made, to be with his Apostles, &amp; other faithfull ministers, teaching the things, which he had commanded, and dispensing his other or­dinances accordingly. Answerable vnto which, is his other saying (in which, his termes, and meaning do well suit) <span class="hi">that Church-men e­ver ordeyned Ministers, &amp; not the lay people.</span> To this also let his inferēce be added in another place pag. 311. that, <span class="hi">if we receive, and hold our baptism from Rome, why not our ordination also?</span> And in his former book<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1289">Pag: 144.</span> most clearly condemning our <span class="hi">Ministers</span> for <span class="hi">being made by such, as are no Ministers: contrary to the constant practise of the Church of God from the dayes of Adam hitherto.</span> And agayn, that <span class="hi">this custome of ordeyning Ministers did continue in the times following the Apostles tymes</span> (as be­fore it had done) <span class="hi">in all the Churches of Christendom, as ecclesiasticall wry­ters do make mention: and so through pure, &amp; impure Churches▪ and that, God in the last reformation of his Church, would not break this order; but choose men, who were Bishops ordeyned even in the Popish Church, so that they might ordeyn fit persons afterwards.</span> And this he tels the Reader he <span class="hi">speaks of the Church of England,</span> as in deed he may wel; for other Ch: departed frō Rome, would be loath to joyn in his plea. And lastly, he chargeth vs with great praesumption, for <span class="hi">daring to break this order of God, continued five thowsand, and six hundred years.</span> Novv what can be more vayne? The very poynt which MR. BER­NARD is to prove, and from which he brings his <span class="hi">historicall narration</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e32838"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=204">[Page 406]</a></span> <span class="hi">from Adam to this day,</span> is, that God hath continued the course of succession in the <span class="hi">Romish Ministery,</span> and that from, and by it suc­cessively, the Ministery in England hath been, and is at this day, continued. And yet in his answer to Mr Smyth, he is driven to affirm, that he hath no referēce at all to <span class="hi">the Romish Ministery,</span> which he accounts <span class="hi">Idolatry,</span> and superstition: but <span class="hi">meanes such a personal succession, as hath ioyned with it a true office, true</span> doctrine, and the like. He will haue <span class="hi">succession continued from the dayes of Adam hitherto;</span> and this to haue been <span class="hi">the order of God for five thowsand, and six hundred yeres:</span> and that he chose <span class="hi">Bishops ordeyned in the Popish Church, to or­deyn fit persons in the Church of England:</span> and yet Mr Smith <span class="hi">is to know</span> he speaks <span class="hi">not</span> at all <span class="hi">of the succession in the Romish Ministery, which is ido­latry, and superstition.</span></p><p>Now that the more simple reader may not loose himself in this mans maze, and that he may the better know the state of the quaestion, and judge of it, I will here interpose some few thinges, touching succession and ordination accordingly.</p><p>First then wee acknowledge, that in the right and orderly state of things, no Ministers are to be ordeyned, but by Ministers, the latter by the former in the Churches, where they are, and o­ver which the holy Ghost hath set them. And so the Apostles be­ing generall, and extraordinary men (vnto whom the Evangelists also were joyned for assistance to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1290"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Cor: 3▪ 6.

Act: 15 36. 1 Cor. 4. 17.</span> <span class="hi">the care of all the Churches</span> committed vnto them, and were charged with them, so were they also to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1292">Act. 14. 23. Tit. 1. 5</span> <span class="hi">ordeyn</span> the <span class="hi">Elders</span> and Bishops in them, and the people bound <span class="hi">to wayt theyr comming</span> for that purpose, as Mr Ber. truly affirmeth: as were also these Bishops, or Elders to ordeyn others in the Churches over which they were set, &amp; so others after them in the order appoynted by Christ in his Apostles; with whō also he promised <span class="hi">to be alwayes till the worlds end,</span> in this and the like their holy ministrations. But is the consequence good, that, by­cause<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1293">Math. 28. 20.</span> the Apostles and Evangelists were to ordeyn Elders in the Churches by Cōmission from Christ, and that the people conver­ted from Indaism, or Paganism, were to wayt till they came to ordeyn them theyr ministers, therefore the Pope, and Prelates vnder him have cōmission from Christ to ordeyn his priests and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e32957"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=204">[Page 407]</a></span> that the people converted from Antichristianism are to wayt <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> they come to ordeyn them their Ministers, or till they send them such as they have alwayes in store ordeyned to their hands? or that bycause the Apostles, and Evangelists had Christs promise to be with them alwayes, that therefore the Pope, Cardinalls, Lord Bi­shops, and Lord Suffragans have interest in the same promise. It might asvvell be concluded, that as the Lords people were bound to <span class="hi">obey, and submit vnto</span> the former in their times, so are they now to submit vnto, and obey the Pope, and his vnderlings. And yet is this the very mark Mr Bernard aymes at in his long drawn <span class="hi">histo­ricall narration:</span> this is the force of his argument, and his manner of arguing. If this lyne hold from Peter to the Pope, and from the Pope to his clergy, and so successively to the Ministery of En­gland, then it stands vpright; if it break, then doth the ministery of England▪ (which as Mr Bernard truely, &amp; honestly confesseth is thus raysed) fall flat to the ground: as indeed it doth according to the foretelling of the Angel, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1294">Rev. 14. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">it is fallen, it is fallen, Babylon the great City.</span></p><p>But here it wilbe demaunded of me, how <span class="hi">the Lords people comming out of Babylon,</span> separating from Rome, are to obteyn, and enjoy Ministers. Surely one of these three wayes. Eyther by the extaor­dinary, immediate, or miraculous designation of God; or by suc­cession; or by the same peoples choise, or appointment, to which they are to minister. To expect ministers by the first meanes were fancy▪ and presumption: so that by one of the two other wayes they must come necessarily. The power of the holy things of God, &amp; so specially of erecting the minstery, is eyther tyed to the order of office, &amp; so to the order of to the Popeship, &amp; Praelacy under it, or els to the faith of the people of God forsaking Babylō, &amp; joyning together in the covenant of Abrahā, &amp; fellowship of the gospel. The former of these though Mr B: be drivē to plead it in the proof of succession, yet in the defence of it, he is forced to disclaym, &amp; disavow: yeelding <span class="hi">the Romish Ministery to be Idolatry, and superstition,</span> and that he speaks of such a <span class="hi">succession,</span> as <span class="hi">requires with it a true office, true doctrine, true sacraments, and prayer.</span> pag. 188. and agayn that he <span class="hi">meanes by succession a continuance of Gods ordinance by persons elected thereto from tyme to tyme, being of spirituall kindred by the fayth of doctrine,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33024"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=205">[Page 408]</a></span> <span class="hi">by which the ordinance is vpheld, and true succession mainteyned.</span> pag 190. With which graunt of his I might rest, as indeed wherein he yeel­deth the whole cause, and cutts off, as it were, with his own hands, the cord of true succession in the Ch: of Rome; making it to fayl, when the truth of doctrine, and of election fayled in the same Ch:. But bycause it is so common a thing with him, to say, and vnsay▪ and to say agayn the same things, eyther forgetting himself, or thinking others forgets, or bycause he would say something to every thing, though never so contrary both to the truth, and him­self in another place, I will presse Mr Smythes other Arguments. The third of which is, that by the doctrine of succession men are bound absolutely to sin, in joyning to the sinns of the Minister. <span class="hi">This is</span> sayth Mr B: <span class="hi">to take vnproved a principle of Brownism to overthrow a truth, namely, that a man cannot receive the holy things of God, but he must needs sin with others.</span></p><p>And is it so indeed? Doe not the scriptures every where teach men to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1295">Rom: 16 17. Gal: 1. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1 Tim: 6. 3. 4. 5.

Wherevpon it followeth, that the doctrine, which binds the Mini­stery, and other holy things of God vnto succession, and thereby to partake with haeretiques, and false teachers, or at least with such in their ministration, as have received the power, and authority by which they minister frō the Pope, and his Praelacy, bynds men to sinne in joyning with the sinns of the Ministers.</p><p>Of the Iewish Church &amp; Preisthood (which Mr Ber<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>here objects) I haue spoken formerly, and do now adde, that, as no man is now so tyed to any Church, or Ministery in the world, as was every faythfull person in the world then to that one temple, and Preist­hood at Ierusalem, so neyther could any man then, without sinn, communicate with an <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>aereticall, or idolatrous Preist, especially ministring in a false office, and by the like calling, and cōmissi­on, which the Ministers both in Rome, and England doe.</p><p>In the 4. Argument Mr Ber: deales dishonestly. Mr Smiths inference vpon the doctrine of succession, is, that then the Lord hath made the Ministers Lords over the Church, so that the Church cannot have or enjoy any of the Lords ordinances, or holy things, except they will consent vnto them; for the holy things are in their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33090"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=205">[Page 409]</a></span> power. Now Mr Ber. onely trifles about the word <span class="hi">Lord,</span> and passeth by the substance of the inference which is most sound vp­on the doctrine. For if the Lords ordinances and holy things be tyed to the Ministers, then without their consent there can be no vse of them. And so where Ministers eyther are not, or not willing to cōmunicate them, there can be no Church, no electiō of Ministers, no keyes of the kingdom, and so no salvation: as I have formerly manifested vpon Math. 16. 19.</p><p>The sum of Mr Smithes <span class="hi">5.</span> Argument is, that then the Pope may excommunicate the whole Church vniversall; the Bishops their whole Dioceses, and Provinces: and the Praesbytery the particular Church whereof it is. Your answer Mr Bernard, is, that this were to <span class="hi">do the Pope a great favour to prove him to have an vniversall power,</span> &amp;c. and 2. that <span class="hi">by this sequell</span> of Mr Smythes, <span class="hi">this absurdity would follow, that the Bishop might cast out the Church, out of the Church.</span></p><p>It is you that do the Pope this great favour, though you would not own it. For if the Ministery make the Church, and that Rome be a true Church, then must the ministery of Rome be true, specially of the Pope, from which the other is deri­ved as from the head.</p><p>Agayn, if <span class="hi">the ordinatiō by the Bishops in the impure Church of Rome be the Lords order,</span> as you expresly affirm p. 145. of your former book, then must the Popes vniversall power, by which the Bishops doe vniversally ordeyn, be the power of the Lord which from him he hath received for that purpose. They which hold, that the power of the keyes was given first &amp; immediately to the Apostle Peter, &amp; so to the Popes of Rome his successours, they hold that the Pope may excommunicate the whole Church: so they which hold the Bishop, or his substitute to be meant, where Christ sayth, <span class="hi">tell the Church,</span> they must necessarily hold, that the Bishop or his substi­tute may excommunicate his whole Province, or Dioces; and so of them which hold the Praesbytery to be the Ch: there spoken of, for the particular assembly over which it is. The Church there meant may excōmunicate any brother, or brethren (whom, or how ma­ny soever) that refuse to hear her: as <span class="hi">the Church of Corinth,</span> to whō <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1297">1 Cor. 1. 2. &amp; <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 13</span> Paul writ might judge all <span class="hi">them which were within,</span> and not <span class="hi">without, &amp; vnder the Lords iudgement</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33165"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=206">[Page 410]</a></span>The substance of the seventh, &amp; last objection, is, (for the 6. hath no weight in it) that the doctrine of succession overthrowes it self, and the Reason is, bycause one POPE doth not make another by ordination whyles he lives, but the Cardinals do by Election make the new Pope after the death of the former. So that the Pope receiving his ministeriall power from the Cardi­nals, cannot give it to them, and so to the rest of the Clergy in Rome, and England, neyther can it descend from Christ through the Apostles, and so through him to the other inferiour ministers, but as in a chayn if the highest link be broken, the rest which hang vpon it must needs fall: So if there be a breach of this chayn of succession from the Apostles to the ministery of Rome, and of En­gland (which descends of it lineally) in the higest link, the Pope, all the rest of the chayn that hangs vpon it, except it be otherwise vpheld, must needs fall flat vpon the ground. It is true which Mr Ber: answers that election, and succession by ordination may stand together in the ministery, but in this case it cannot, except the Pope should by the election of the Cardinalls, or others, or­deyn his succession whilest himselfe survived. Now in this last an­swer Mr B: challengeth his adversary to be <span class="hi">wilde in wandering,</span> and to have <span class="hi">lost his quaestion, in concluding that</span> the doctrine <span class="hi">of succession is a false doctrine, where he should prove that Christs power is not given to the principall members.</span> But this challenge is both vnjust, &amp; vnadvised. Vnjust, bycause succession from the popish Church, and Clergy is made by M: Ber: in his former book the foundation of the minis­tery of England, and so of the Church: the Church by his affir­mation being made by the ministers, and <span class="hi">the Ministers by such Bi­shops</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1298">pag: 145</span> <span class="hi">as were ordeyned in the popish Church.</span> Vnadvised bycause these two poynts, do depend ech vpon other necessarily. For if Christs power be tyed to the officers whether principall, or inferiour, then must it come to the ministery, and Church of England by succession: if it come not by succession from, or by the Pope, and his Clergy, then must it come by the same successiō of fayth, &amp; doctrine vnto the children of Abraham, two or three, or more faithfull persons joyned together in the covenant, and fellowship of the gospel.

And for this purpose let it be further observed, that no power at all came vnto the Church of the Iewes by the Levites: not the vse of the sacrament of circumcision; no nor of the very sacrifices: which were offered by the first born in the family, and that even after the peoples comming out of Egypt vnder the hand of Mo­ses, till Levi was called to the Preisthood.

If the Ministery of the reformed Churches must be by succession, or ordination by Popish Bishops, then must the same office of Ministery be continued from the one Church to the other: as indeed it was withall the Ministers of the Church of En­gland at the first; who without any new eyther calling, or ordina­tion (which depends vpon it) continued their office, and place formerly received; there being onely a reformation of some of the grossest evills, like the healing of <span class="hi">Iobs soars,</span> as Mr B. speaketh: as the office of Iustice-ship, or the like in the common wealth, may be continued the same in the same persons individually, though by edict of Parliament, or other superiour power, there be a sur­ceasing of some mayn act of it.</p><p>Further to ty the Ministery thus to succession, is to ty the Lords sheep to submit to no other sheepheards but such as the wolves haue appointed.

The Prelates, and those which levell by their lyne do highly ad­vance ordination, and far above the administration of the word,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1300">Bishop Barl. ser: b<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span>e the King.</span> sacraments, and prayer: making it, and the power of excommu­nication the two incōmunicable prerogatives of a Bishop in their vnderstanding above an ordinary minister: But surely herein these cheif ministers do not succeed the cheif ministers, the Apostles, except as darknes succeeds light, and Antichrists confusion Christs order. Where the Apostles were sent out by Christ, there was no mention of ordination; their charge was to <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1301">Math. 28. 20</span> <span class="hi">go teach all na­tions, and baptize them:</span> and that the Apostles accounted preaching their principall work, and after it <span class="hi">baptism,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">prayer</span> the scriptures<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1302">"A<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t. 6. 4. 1.

Wherein as he vnfitly compares together things not to be compa­red, to wit, baptism into the name of the true God, &amp; ordinatiō, into a false office (except he hold a masse-preisthood a true office) so doth he vnadvisedly confound a part with the whole, yea the last, and least part, as ordination is: and which doth indeed depend vpon the peoples lawfull election, as an effect vpon the cause, by vertue of which it is justly administred, &amp; may be thus described, or considered of vs: as the admission of, or putting into posses­sion, a person lawfully elected, into, or of a true Office of Mini­stery. For example, the Maior, Baylife, or other cheif officer in a priviledged City, or Corporation, is chosen by the people to his office, but withall must be entred, and inaugurated with some solemn ceremony, as the giving of the Cities keyes, or sword, in­to his hand, or the like, by his praedecessour. So is it with the Mi­nisters, the officers of this spirituall corporation the Church, the right vnto their offices they have by election, the possession of thē by ordination, with the ceremony of imposition of hands. The Apostle <span class="hi">Peter,</span> advertising <span class="hi">the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1306">Act. 1. 15. 16. 21. 22. 26.</span> <span class="hi">disciples, or brethren</span> that <span class="hi">one</span> (so fit­ted as is there noted) was <span class="hi">to be made in the room of Iudas, a witnesse with the eleven Apostles, of the resurrection of Christ,</span> (when <span class="hi">two</span> were by them <span class="hi">praesented,</span> such as were fit, and by them so deemed) did, with the rest <span class="hi">praesent them two,</span> and none other, <span class="hi">to the Lord,</span> that he by the īmediate directiō of the <span class="hi">lot</span> might <span class="hi">shew, whether of them two</span> he had chosen. In like maner <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1307">Ch. 6. 2. 3. 5. 6.</span> <span class="hi">the twelve</span> being to institute the office of Deaconry in the Ch: at Ierusalem, <span class="hi">called the multitude of the disciples together,</span> and informed them what manner of persons they were to <span class="hi">chuse:</span> which choise being made by the brethren accordingly, and they so chosen <span class="hi">praesented to the Apostles,</span> they forthwith ordey­ned them, by vertue of the election so made by the brethren.

Now the Apostles were in a manner straungers vnto them, cōming as it were to one place over night, and ready to depart the next morning, or at least tarrying a very small whyle in <span class="hi">every Church,</span> as doth appear, both by the course of the story, &amp; by the many severall places they <span class="hi">passed</span> to, &amp; fro, &amp; those some of them distant one from another a great space, both by sea, and land. So that neyther the liberty of the very Apostles was so great in ordeyning, as was the peoples in chusing: neither were they to ordeyn but such as the other choose, nor but to ordeyn them, except just exception were against them: neyther was their ordination so much as the others election, no more then possession is so much as right: neyther did the Apo­stles in their ordination rely so much vpon their own as vpon the peoples knowledge, and experience of the men, which were to be called into office.</p><p>Besides these things, though it appear that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1309">Act. 13. 1. 2. 3. 1 Tim. 4. 14 &amp; 2. 1. 6.

Now if the acceptation of a mixt company vnder the Praelates government, (as is the best parish assembly in the kingdom) wherof the greatest part haue by the revealed will of God, no right to the covenant, ministery, or other holy things, be sufficient to make a minister, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33540"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=208">[Page 415]</a></span> then much more the acceptation of the people with vs, being all of them joyntly, and every one of them severally, by the mer­cy of God, capable of the Lords ordinances.</p><p>These things, thus opened, I come in the next, and last place to manifest, what liberty the scriptures, just consequence, &amp; good reason do allow the people for the reducing themselves into the order, and under the Ministery of Christ, after some generall co­fusion, such as the Papacy was, and is.</p><p>And for this purpose I entreat the reader to recognize with me the points lately mentioned, and proved in the former part of the book, namely that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1311">pag. 125. 126.—130. 131.</span> <span class="hi">a company of faithful people in the covenant of the Gospel are a Church, though without officers:</span> that <span class="hi">this Church hath inter­est in all the holy things of God within it self, and immediately vnder Christ the head, without any forreyn assistance:</span> that in cases, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1312">pag. 142. 143. 144.</span> <span class="hi">a private per­son, or brother, in such a Church, may do a necessary work of an officer:</span> &amp; lastly, that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1313">pag. 149. 150. 151.</span> <span class="hi">the keyes of the kingdom were given to, and the Church to be built vpon the rock of Peters confession,</span> Math. 16. And so I come to the point it self.</p><p>I do then acknowledge, that where there are already lawfull officers in a Church, by, and to which, others are called, there the former, vpon that election, are to ordeyn, and appoint the latter. The officers, being the ministers of the Church, are to exequute the determinations, and iudgements of the Church vnder the Lord: the Censures of deposition, and excommunication by pro­nouncing the sentence of iudgment, and by it, as by the sword of the spirit drawn out, cutting of the officer from his office, and the member from the bodie, and all cōmunion with it: So are they to exequute the peoples election by pronouncing the person elect to his office, charging him with the faythfull execution of it, with imposition of hands, and prayer. And indeed ordination, in the calling of the ministers is properly the exequutiō of electiō.</p><p>But as in a civil corporation, or City, though the Maior, Baylif, or other cheif officer elect, be at his <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nterance, and inaugu­ration, to receive at the hands of his praedecessour, the sword, or keyes of the City, or to have some other solemn Ceremony by him performed vnto him: yet if eyther there be no former, as at the first; or that the former be dead, or vpon necessity absent, when <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e33597"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=209">[Page 416]</a></span> his successour entereth, then is this Ceremony and work per­formed by some other the fittest instrument: neyther need that City borrow an officer of another City: neyther could he inter­medle there, without vsurpation, though both the Corporations haue the same Charter, vnder the same King: so is it in this spiri­tuall Corporation, and City of God, the Church: the former officers, if there be any in that particular congregation, are to or­deyn such as succeed: but if none be to be found, this Corpora­tion is not to goe to the next to borrow an officer, or two, but may vse such fit persons, as shee hath, for that service so absolute­ly necessary: neither may the officers of an other Corporation do the acts of their office in that, except they be eyther Apostles, or Evangelists, and have generall charges: or rather except they will make themselues Popes: as indeed this exorbitant, and ro­ving course makes as many vniversall Bishops, in respect of power, &amp; so likewise of exequution, if there be occasion, as there are of­ficers in all the Churches. But to come vnto the scriptures, it hath been formerly noted that <span class="hi">the first born</span> in the family, before the law, did perform the preists office: in whose place the <span class="hi">Levites</span> were afterwards substituted. Now as <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1314">Exod: 29. 1. 2. 3 &amp;.</span> <span class="hi">the Preists</span> of the Levites did not enter vpō their office without solemn <span class="hi">consecration,</span> nor the ministers of the new testament vpon theirs, without solemn <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1315">Act: 6. 6 &amp; 14. 23.</span> <span class="hi">ordination</span> or <span class="hi">appoyntment,</span> so neyther can it be conceived, that the first borne did <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1316">Heb: 5. 4</span> <span class="hi">take vnto themselues the honour</span> to administer, without some solemnity performed to or vpon them, by their predecessours: &amp; so we read, that when <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1317">Gen: 27. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>7.</span> <span class="hi">Isaak</span> conveyed <span class="hi">the blessing, and</span> birthright to Iacob, he <span class="hi">kissed him,</span> as did <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1318">: ch: 48 17. 18. 19 20.</span> <span class="hi">Iacob</span> also <span class="hi">lay his right vpon the head of Ephraim,</span> when with the blessing he did transfer the birthright to him from <span class="hi">Manasseth.</span> But if the father of the family were sud­dainly taken away, or dyed before his first borne were capable of this ministration, then could he not thus solemnly resigne, or transmit to him the office, or work, but there must needs have been some interposition of another, if any solemn admis­sion at all were required.

And what hindereth but that the Church, the multitude, the Disciples (call them as you wil) in the fellow­ship, and covenant of the gospell, may be as clearely informed in their duety, and as effectually exhorted to the vse of their liberty by the writings of the Prophets, and Apostles, as by their speaches.

If it haue officers, it must vse them as hands to put the persons by ordination into that of­fice, to which they haue right by election: but if it want officers, it may, and must vse other the fittest instruments it hath: as in the naturall body, if men want hands, or be deprived of the vse of them, they do for their present necessity vse their teeth, or feet, or other fittest parts of the body, for the busynes possible to be done by them.</p><p>Lastly if the Lord should rayse vp in America, or the like place, a company of faythfull men, and women, (which <span class="hi">of stones</span> should become <span class="hi">children to Abraham</span>) by the reading of the scriptures, or by some godly mens writings, or (which is most like) by the holy instructions, and exhortations of some merchants, or travay­lers, how, or by what meanes should they come by Ministers?

But what to do hath the Pope of Rome, or the Bishops in England, or the Praesbytery in Germany, or France to appoynt them in America Ministers? It is evident that such an assembly, as I speak of, having received the gospel, haue received the keyes of the kingdome, and the power of Christ: and being joyned in this fellowship of the gospell, haue the joynt vse of the keyes, &amp; power of Christ: &amp; being within the covenaunt of Abraham, are the Ch: of God: &amp; so haue power to choose, and appoynt their own Mini­sters frō within themselves.

To which I do ad fur­ther, first, that the words do <span class="hi">sit</span> in Moses chayr, and whatsoever they <span class="hi">bid</span> you do, may more strictly after the Greek be turned <span class="hi">have sit in MOSES chayre,</span> and <span class="hi">have bidden you observe,</span> that is, what you have heard of them formerly according to Mo­ses, that do, and observe. But let the words be as they are, and that Christ speakes of the time to come, yet I see not how in them, the LORD eyther commaunds, or approves of his disciples hearing the Scribes, &amp; Pharisees in their publique, and solemn ad­ministrations: but if he speak of them, then he may onely per­mit his DISCIPLES in respect of their weaknes, and being (for the present) too much addicted vnto them, so to hear them: or otherwise Christ may speak of such occasionall meetings and conferences, as passed ordinarily between the Pharisees, and his disciples: wherin what was of Moses, he willes them to receive from them, without praejudice of their persons: and so we do also will, and exhort the people with vs to receive, and reteyn whatso­ever of God they hear from you, or any others vpon the like occa­sion. And considering, that in the first verse Christ <span class="hi">spake vnto the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1390">Math. 9. 11. &amp; 17. 10.</span> <span class="hi">multitude, and to his disciples,</span> (laying no more vpon his disciples in this case, then vpon the multitude) and what respect the disci­ples had the Pharisees in, and how oft, and vsually they met, and medled together, it is very probable, that Christ, vpon this sup­position, that the disciples would, or should hear, or meet with them, intends onely to provide, that the word of God may re­teyn all due authority with his, in that confused estate wherein all things then stood: neyther cōmaunding, nor approving the hea­ring of them.</p><p>And considering what Christ himself testifieth of <span class="hi">the Scribes, &amp; Pharisees</span> in that very chapter, that they <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1391">v. 13.</span> <span class="hi">shut vp the kingdom<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> of heaven before men, neyther going in themselves, nor suffering them that would:</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1392">ver. 15.</span> <span class="hi">making those of their profession two-fold more the children of hel, then thēselves:</span> what haeresies they taught touching justificatiō by works, and perfect obedience to the whole law, how they <span class="hi">made voyd the commaundements of God for their own traditions:</span> how they denyed in Christ both the person, and office of the Messiah: blaspheming <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e35386"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=218">[Page 435]</a></span> him in his doctrine as a <span class="hi">deceiver</span> of the people; in his life as <span class="hi">a glut­ton, and drinker of wyne;</span> and in his most glorious miracles as one that wrought them by <span class="hi">the "Divel;</span> considering I say these things, it should be strange that Christ should eyther send his disciples to be taught by these <span class="hi">blynde guides,</span> or approve of their hearing them, him self also being the onely<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1393">v: 8. 10.</span> <span class="hi">doctour and teacher</span> of his Church.

Now for the 2. reason, who is ignorant how many thowsands in the land are most dangerously nourished in their erroneous, &amp; superstitious perswasions by the howses themselves (to let passe the particular both memorials of, and incitements vnto Idolatry stil appearing in some places more, &amp; in some lesse) knowing none other Church, to which God hath promised his speciall praesence, and wherein he wilbe glorified, save in that of lime, and stone: &amp; putting holynes in the very place: And how well your Church provides for this, appeares in sundry things; as in whyting the walls of the houses, where you silenced the preachers: in bynding the people absolutely to the places, though litle care be taken, what eyther they, or the ministers, to whom they come, do there, so they deale not too faythfully in the Lords buesines: in tying Christiā buriall absolutely to the Church, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36229"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=223">[Page 444]</a></span> or Church-yard, where the Minister, with all his holy implements,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1431">Service book.

Ainsworth hath given answer in the particulars: of which I entreat the Reader to take knowledge: and do therevnto annex these considerations.</p><p>First, it is a very presumptuous thing for these ministers, yea or for any men or angels thus peremptorily to determine how much knowledg a man must have to be saved: that if he have iust so much,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1452">I.</span> then he may be, or is it the state of salvation: if he want any of that, he cannot be saved. Who knowes by how litle knowledge the Lord may, and doth save a man, that is faythfull in the litle he knowes, and endevours by all means to further knowledge, and so to further faythfulnes? As on the contrary, the Lord rejects many with greater knowledg, for their vnfaythfulnes, both in not practi­sing the things they know, and in neglecting to know more, least they should learne that truth, which they have no mynde to pra­ctise for feare, or in other corrupt regards.</p><p>And howsoever I do acknowledge a difference of truthes, and that some are more, and some lesse principall, yet do I wish more conscience in the application of this distinction. For whereas the ministers are by the lawes, and penaltyes, Civill, and Ecclesiastical, limited in their doctrine; and both the ministers, and people in their obedience of, and to the truth of the gospel, and ordinances of the new testament, this is made a salve for every sore, that they have <span class="hi">the substance of the gospell; the doctrine of fayth: all fundamentall truthes:</span> and <span class="hi">whatsoever is necessary to salvation.</span> In which defence (as it is made) there are these evills.</p><p>First, in it men not onely endeavour (which is too much) <span class="hi">the cu­ring of Babell,</span> but iudeed to make Babell beleeve shee stands in no great need of curing▪ and that her wounds are neyther deadly, nor daungerous.</p><p>2. It tends to vilify, and make of small moment many of the Lords truthes, &amp; ordinances, howsoever these <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1453">Pag: 173 174.</span> ministers wil not heare of it. And this will appeare, if the end be considered of these <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36616"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=225">[Page 449]</a></span> distinctions, and qualifications: which is, that men should setle themselves, without pressing further in the disobedience, and want of sundry of the cōmaundements, and ordinances of Christ Iesus, till with bodily peace, and leave of the magistrate, they might en­joy the same. And if <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1454">Math. 15. 6.</span> <span class="hi">the Scribes and Pharisees</span> were reproved of Christ for <span class="hi">making the commaundements, of God of none authority by their tradi­tions,</span> do not they make the commaundements of God, and ordi­nances of Christ of small moment, who for the traditions, and in­ventions of men (yea of <span class="hi">that man of sin</span>) though supported by the arme of flesh, haue forborn and do forbear (and, so purpose to go on) the obedience of the fame? which whether it be not the very estate of these ministers in forbearing to preach (that I may let passe other matters) for the refusall of subscription, and confor­mity, let their own consciences judge. And mark their defence.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1455">pag. 174.</span> They <span class="hi">beleiv, and teach that there is no part of the holy scripture, which every Christian is not necessarily bound to seek, and desire the knowledge of, so far forth, as in him lyeth.</span> Here is a great charge layd vpon <span class="hi">every Christian to seek the knowledge of every part of holy scripture:</span> but no word of his o­bedience unto every part of it: as if <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1456">Mat. 28. 19 20. 21.</span> <span class="hi">Christ</span> had not <span class="hi">sent out his A­postles</span> to <span class="hi">teach men to observ, to the worlds end,</span> but to know, <span class="hi">what he had commaunded them:</span> and as if <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1457">Psal. 119. 105.</span> <span class="hi">the word</span> of God were onely <span class="hi">a light and lanthorn</span> vnto mens eyes, that they might see the wayes of God, and not to their <span class="hi">feet,</span> and <span class="hi">pathes,</span> that they might walk in them. The same Prophet in the same Psalm entreats the <span class="hi">Lord</span> to <span class="hi">teach him the way of his statutes,</span> that <span class="hi">he might keep it vnto the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1458">ver. 33. 34.</span> <span class="hi">end:</span> &amp; that he would <span class="hi">give him vnderstanding, that he might keep his law:</span> professing also in the same place, that he was comforted in GOD against all that <span class="hi">confusion,</span> which his enemyes would have brought vpon him, that he had <span class="hi">respect to all GODS commaundements:</span> and this respect was not of bare knowledge, but of observation, and obedience, as appears in all the five verses before going. Neyther therefore can the ministers ex­cuse themselves from <span class="hi">making some parts of the holy scriptures of small moment, and needles,</span> as Mr Barrow chargeth them, bycause they ad­vise the people to <span class="hi">desire the knowledge</span> of them, except with their<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1459">ver. 6.</span> knowledge they joyned obedience; neyther ought the people to rest in that vnsound advise, considering that, <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1460">Iā: 4. 17.</span> <span class="hi">to him that</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36738"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=226">[Page 450]</a></span> <span class="hi">knoweth how to do well, and doth it not, to him it is sinn:</span> and that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1461">Luk. 12. 47.</span> <span class="hi">to him that knoweth his maysters will, and doth it not, many stripes</span> are due.</p><p>3. This pleading by the ministers, that they <span class="hi">hould, and enioy every fundamentall truth, and whatsoever is of necessity to salvation,</span> (cōsidering the end of it, which is, the stopping of the people from pressing vnto further obedience, and profession of the will of God, and or­dinances of Christ) is injurious both to the growth, and sincerity of the obedience of Gods people. For whereas they ought to be <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1462">Heb. 6. 1.</span> <span class="hi">led forward vnto perfection,</span> this teacheth them to stay in the founda­tion, as if it were sufficient for the building of the house, that the foundation were layd: &amp; secondly, it insinuates, that it is sufficient, if, men so serue God, as they can obteyn salvation, though with disobediēce of a great part of the revealed wil of God: occasioning them thereby to serve him onely, or chiefly for wages as hypocrites do. As if a child should be taught so far to honour, and please his father as he might get his inheritance, but not much to trouble himself about giving or doing him any further honour, or service.</p><p>Secondly I do answer that this truth, which the ministers make<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1463">II.</span> <span class="hi">t<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> onely fundament truth in religion</span> is held, and professed by as vile hae­retiques, as ever were since Christ came in the flesh. May not a cō ­pany of excōmunicates hold, teach, and defend this truth, and yet are they not a true Church of God.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1464">III.</span></p><p>3. I deny, that <span class="hi">the whole Church of England: hath received, and doth hold, and professe this fundamentall, truth:</span> how boldly soever these <span class="hi">mi­nisters</span> affirme it. They <span class="hi">graunt there are many Atheists in the land,</span> (they<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1465">pag. 166.</span> might say in the Church, for Atheists are, and ever wilbe of the Kings, &amp; states religion) &amp; <span class="hi">many ignorant, and wicked men besides, who make not so clear, and holy a profession of the true fayth, as they should.</span> And do these <span class="hi">Atheists hold, and professe the true fayth, and every article of Gods holy truth, which is fundamentall?</span> Are there not many thowsands in the nationall Church ignorant of the very first rudiments, &amp; foun­dations<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1466">Heb. 6. 1. 2.</span> of religion, as the Apostle noteth them down: and can they hold, and professe that whereof they are ignorant? Yea how can any wicked men hold, that CHRIST is their saviour, but they hold an apparantly in the eyes of all men? for which not­withstanding these Ministers wil have them reputed true members of Christs body. I ad, that since the body of that Church or na­tion, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e36830"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=226">[Page 451]</a></span> consists of mere naturall men, and that naturall men are Pa­pists in the case of justification, and look to be saved by their good meaning, and well doings, it is most vntruly affirmed by those ministers, that their Church <span class="hi">accounts none her members, but such as pro­fesse salvation by Christ onely.</span> They hold otherwise and so professe, if an account of their fayth be demaunded, as I have shewed by the testimony of Mr. Nichols, and could do by the testimony of o­thers, if all men did not see it too evidently. And yet see what these men affirme and that <span class="hi">confidently,</span> and without fear, for their advan­tage: as that their <span class="hi">whole Church makes profession of the true fayth;</span> that it <span class="hi">holds, and maintayns every article fundamentall of Gods holy truth:</span> and particularly that <span class="hi">Iesus Christ the sonne of God</span> and lastly that <span class="hi">they that receive this truth, are the people of God, and in the state of salvatiō.</span> Wher­vpon it must follow, that their whole nationall Church is in the state of salvation. And surely so had it need be (in the judgment of men) having the promises and seales of the covenant of salva­tion applyed, and ministered vnto it, and to every member of it.</p><p>Lastly, though the whole Church of England, and every mem­ber<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1467">IIII.</span> in it, did personally professe the true fayth in holines, as all the true members of the Church do (which are therefore called both <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1468">Eph: 1. 1.</span> <span class="hi">saynts, and faythfull</span>) and that we had do just exception agaynst that prophane, and implicite profession, for which both Mr. Ber. and the ministers plead, yet could nor this make it or them a true Church. The bare profession of fayth makes not a true Church, except the persons so professing be vnited in the Covenant, and fellowship of the gospel into particular congregations, having the entyre power of Christ within themselves.

The defence of their nationall Church, and of the compulsion of all the flagitious persons in the nation to ioyne, &amp; continue members of it, drives them to this absurd assertion, that the whole nation, <span class="hi">or</span> land was <span class="hi">at the first converted</span> to the fayth of Christ.</p><p>And where they speak of many in all ages since called by the gospell which also they have sealed with their blood, as I confesse this with Mr Ainsworth, (and rejoyce for the mercy of God to­wards them this way) so I doubt not but the truthes taught in Rome have been effectuall to the saving of many: for which also there have many of them (and no doubt, would many more if there were occasiō) lay down their lives against Pagans, &amp; Infidels.</p><p>But these men should prove first, that the body of the land have been converted to the fayth of CHRIST, and orderly joyned into particular congregations: and 2. that it hath so continued ever since, even in the tymes, when the blood of those Martyrs now spoken of, was shed by the lawes civil, and Ecclesi­astical, made by the body of it, through the seduction of Antichrist, for that purpose: and so that there needed no new gathering after the Romish apostasy, by the preaching of the gospell on the one side, and by willing subjection in free, and personal profession, on the other.</p><p>That which they ad of <span class="hi">sundry secret congregations in Queen Maryes dayes in many parts of the land,</span> is but a boast: there were very few of them in any. But where they say, that these <span class="hi">did vpon Queen Elizabeths entrance openly professe the gospell,</span> it is vntrue; there was not one con­gregation separated in Queen Maryes dayes, that so remayned in Queen Elizabeths. The congregations were dissolved, and the persons in them bestowed themselves in their severall parishes, where their livings, and estates lay. The circumcised were mingled with the vncircumcised, whence came that monstrous confusion, agaynst which we witnes. And shew me one of your ministers con­tinuing his charge in Queen Elizabeths dayes, over the flock to which he ministred (in Queen Maryes dayes) the persequuted gospell. It is certayn the congregations (whether many, or few) were all dispersed, and that the members of them joyned them­selves to the prophane Apostate Papists, where their outward <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e37854"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=231">[Page 461]</a></span> occasions lay. As then an handfull, or bundle of co<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e shufled into a feild of weeds, though in it selfe it retayn the same nature, yet cannot make the feild a corn feild: so neither could this small hād­ful of separated people in Queen Maryes dayes sanctify the whole feyld of the idolatrous, &amp; prophane multitude in the land, by their seating themselves amongst them.</p><p>As then it is not true, that the body of the land, in the begin­ning of Queen Elizabeths reigne, did joyne vnto the secret con­gregations (so remayning) in Queen Maryes dayes: but on the contrary, these congregations did dissolve, and joyne themselves with the vnhallowed rowt in the popish, &amp; profane parishes vnder their late (masse, &amp; their dūb) priests for the most part: so neyther matters it which ioyned ūto which since the vnhallowed, &amp; grace­les multitude neither could by the word of God ioyn vnto others, nor be ioyned to by them in the covenant of grace and of the gospell, with the seales and other the ordinances thereof, to which they had, or have no right. Vpō the same groūd also I infer, that it is not materiall, though <span class="hi">the people</span> were <span class="hi">not compelled to the profission of the gospell</span> before <span class="hi">the midsomer after the Queen came to the crown:</span> if they were compelled to professe the gospel, of, and vnto which, they were apparantly, and notoriously ignorant, and disobedient, as they were. They knew what they were to look for: and so being, for the most part, of no religiō, they set themselves to conform, as the tymes were, to that, which they discerned the Queen to be of.</p><p>And for the <span class="hi">Preachers, and Cōmissioners, which were sent</span> before this set day, for the catholik fayth of all the Queens subjects, as I think it was well, so was it not sufficient to make the whole land, or to prepare them to be a true Church: besides that the people were of the Church all this while: the same nationall, provinciall, dio­cesan, and parochiall Church, &amp; Churches consisting of the same persons generally, still continuing vnder the same government, &amp; ministery, &amp; in the same will-worship, though in a measure refor­med, as before in Queen Maryes dayes.</p><p>Now for the Preachers you name, as <span class="hi">Mr Knoxe, Lever;</span> &amp;c. which <span class="hi">exercised their Ministery in some of the best reformed Churches, during Q. Maryes reign,</span> as the good they did to some few. (in comparison) by the truthes they taught, could not make all the Queens sub­jects <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e37920"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=232">[Page 462]</a></span> a true nationall Church, so do we all know how hardly they were suffered in the begīning of the Queens reign, &amp; that contrary to the publick Church-government, &amp; ministery: as also that ney­ther they, nor any others, could or can be admitted to any Church by any ministery received in the reformed Churches, but onely by the ordination of a popish Praelate whether English, or Romish, it matters not: by which also it is apparant to all men vpon what string the English ministery hangeth.</p><p>Lastly where these men say that <span class="hi">many are dayly added</span> to <span class="hi">the Church by the ministery of the word preached,</span> I marvayl how this can be, and from whence they are added. Addition is a motion, and in every motion, there must be the terms, or bounds, from and to which it is made. All they to whom they preach, are of the Church already: for recusant Papists come not to their Church; and besides the number of them encreaseth dayly. It seemes then they are added from the Church to the same Church. Bycause this practise of <span class="hi">ad­ding</span> men <span class="hi">to the Church</span> by the preaching of the gospell was in vse in the primative Churches, and this phrase vsed in the scriptures: therefore these ministers think they may abuse the phrase, with­out the thing: and so feed their simple readers with words of the winde.</p><p>Of the ministers 4 exceptiō, viz: of <span class="hi">the vniting of the Queens subiects</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1534">Minist:</span> <span class="hi">vnto those professours, whose fellowship</span> in popery <span class="hi">they had forsaken:</span> and of <span class="hi">the course taken</span> for that purpose by the example of the godly Kings<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1535">Answ:</span> of <span class="hi">Iudah</span> I have formerly spoken: of the former part even now: and of the latter els where, declaring. 1. first that <span class="hi">the English nation, and all the people of the kingdom never was admitted into the LORDS covenant, by the rules of the new testament, to become a nationall CHURCH, vnder nationall government, as was IUDAH, and all the people in it vnder the old.</span> If this can be proved I ac­knowledge my self in many great errours: if not it is vanity, and errour, thus to instance in IVDAH, and indeed to revive Iudaism, and the old testament.</p><p>2.

That <span class="hi">the reformation by King Edward, and Queen Elizabeth (though great in it self, and they in it vnder GOD greatly to he honoured) was no­thing comparable to that which was made in Iudah, by Iehosaphat, Iosiah, Asa, Ezechiah, and Nehemiah.</span></p><p>These poynts I have proved at large <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1536">Page 276. 277. 278. 279. &amp;c: to 304</span> else where, and do refer the reader thither for answer, onely I will note some particular oversights of the ministers in this fourth exception: as first, where they say they have <span class="hi">proved there was a true Church in the land before Queen Elizabeths reign;</span> they should have proved, that the Land was a true Church: for so was Iudah. 2. Where they say, that <span class="hi">the noble men were sent by Iehosaphat</span> onely <span class="hi">to accompany, &amp; assist the Levites, &amp; to</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1537">2 Chr: 17. 7</span> <span class="hi">countenance their ministery,</span> where the scriptures affirme they were <span class="hi">sent</span> even <span class="hi">to teach.</span> You will have no teaching but by Church officers: therfore you so put the scripture of. 3. That they say, <span class="hi">Iosiah compelled</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1538">See pag 295. 296. 297. 298.</span> <span class="hi">his subiects to the service of the true God:</span> taking compulsion as they do; where it is evident the people did it freely: though I acknowledge he made compulsive lawes. 4 Speaking of the authority of magi­strates over their subjects they bring in <span class="hi">Ezechias proclamatiō,</span> as they call it, <span class="hi">sent to Israell:</span> wheras the ten tribes were not his subiects, nor he their King. And lastly, that <span class="hi">the Ismaelites were separated from the Church of God:</span> therein acknowledging that IVDAH was alwayes the true Church of God: which I suppose they will not say of Engl: alwayes, or of Rome: if they do, it is their sin to separate from the true Church.</p><p>The fifth, and last exception of the ministers is, that Mr<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1539">Minist:</span> BARROVV &amp; Mr GREENVVOOD <span class="hi">required that the people in the begīning of the Queens reign should by solemn oth, &amp; covenant, have re­nounced Idolatry, &amp; have professed fayth, &amp; obedience to the gospel, after the example of Asaes reformation.</span> To which their answer is, first that <span class="hi">such</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38065"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=233">[Page 464]</a></span> <span class="hi">a covenāting by oath is not absolutely necessary, as appeares in Iehosaphats, &amp; Iosiahs reformation.</span> 2. That <span class="hi">the people was before that oath, &amp; covenāt, Gods true Church: which their people also may be.</span> 3. That <span class="hi">sundry congregations as in Coventry, and Northampton did publiquely professe repentance for their Idolatry, and promised to obey the truth established.</span> 4. They <span class="hi">doubt not to affirm that the whole land in the first Parliament did enter a solemn covenant with the Lord for renouncing of Popery, and receiving the gospell.</span></p><p>That Mr Barr. and Green: should requyre, that the cove­nant<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1540">Answ:</span> into which the Church entereth, should be by oth necessa­rily, is more then I know: or then we practise. But that they re­quired, that <span class="hi">the people,</span> that is, the whole nation, should so have passed a solemn oth, and covenant, I know is most vntrue. All men know they thought the ignorant prophane, popish multi­tude vncapable of the Lords covenant, and the seales of it: &amp; to have requyred of them an oth for such a purpose had been to have requyred of them the taking of Gods name in vayn. Where it is sayd in the 2. place that <span class="hi">the people of Iudah were Gods true Church, before the tyme of that oth, and Covenant,</span> it is true, and agaynst you. And I would demaund of you whether your people were Gods true Church, when Popery reigned. Your answer is, <span class="hi">so may our people bee.</span> You dare not say they were; for then you should acknowledge the Romish Synagogue the true Church of GOD, and that you had sinfully, schismed from it, as Mr Bern. proves agaynst you, and himselfe: you will not say, they were not: for that would make against you in the poynt in hand: and would manifest, (as in deed it doth) that the course ta­ken with Iudah (being the true Church) for her reformation, cannot agree with Rome, or Engl: as a member of the Romish Church for her reformation.</p><p>To that which is added in the 3. place of <span class="hi">Coventry, Nor­thampton,</span> and <span class="hi">some other congregations,</span> my reply is, first that this is not likely to have been the deed of the congregations, but of some two or three forward ministers, (a few of the people it may be approving of it) which their successours were as like to reverse. 2. They did not repent of their publique idolatry nor purpose to obey the truth in sincerity: of their prophane mixture, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38121"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=233">[Page 465]</a></span> Romish hierarchy, and ministery, popish leyturgy, and constituti­ons (according to which all things are administred amongst them) they repented not: and besides they knew right well many truthes, which they purposed not to imbrace. 3. graunt it were (as they pretend) with these few parishes, what must be sayd of the rest which did not so practise? with whom they make, and alwayes have done one entyre nationall Church, or what is this to the pub­lique, and formall state of the Church of England agaynst which we deale. The truth is, these men thus practising, were reputed, (and truely) schismatiques in the formall constitution of the Church: and by which this their dealing hath no warrant at all. If we should object vnto you the Papists doctrines and practi­ses, of two or three ministers amongst you, not warrantable by law, you would not admit of our exception agaynst the formall established estate of your Church: so neyther may we admit of yours, for the practise of two or three, disliking the present state of things, and seeking for reformation of them.</p><p>Lastly, wee see indeed that those <span class="hi">Ministers doubt not to affirme, that the whole land</span> (Papists, and Atheists and all) <span class="hi">did in the first Par­liament of the Queen enter a solemn covenant for renouncing of Popery, and receiving the gospel:</span> but we would see first, how all these swarmes of wicked Atheists, and most flagitious persons were by the revealed will of God capable of the covenant of the new testament, and the seales, and other rites, and priviledges of it. Otherwise this haling them into covenant with the Lord agaynst his expresse will, was a prophane, &amp; presumptuous enterprise in it self, though I doubt not arising from a godly intent in the Queen, &amp; her cheif connsellers being mislead by them, whom they too much trus­ted. 2. We would see what warrant there is in the new testament for this nationall covenant, or that all the people in a Land (since the Land of Canaan was prophaned) should unite into a nationall Church, vnder a nationall government, and ministe­ry. 3. That which wee answered in the 2. place to the former branch of this exception, must here agayn be remembred. 4. this vndoubted <span class="hi">affirmation</span> of the ministers touching the <span class="hi">whole lands covenanting in the Parliament,</span> first inferreth that the enacting of civil <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38151"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=234">[Page 466]</a></span> lawes, and penall statutes by Kings, and States, doth gather CHVRCHES: for none other covenant was there in the Parlia­ment. 2. It confirmeth the popish doctrine of implicite fayth:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1541">see pag: 302 303. 304.</span> &amp; that men may receive, and professe a fayth whereof they are ignorant, yea which they dislike and hate, so farre as they know it: for so was it with the body of your nation, the greatest part by farr being mere <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1542">1 Cor. 2. 14.</span> <span class="hi">naturall men,</span> and so <span class="hi">not knowing</span> the gospel: yea <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1543">Ioh. 3. 20</span> <span class="hi">evil doers,</span> which <span class="hi">hate the light.</span></p><p>Our 2. objection touching the <span class="hi">outward worship wherein the Ch: of England communicateth,</span> comes now to be enforced. In the clea­ring of which the Ministers do (to speak on) insist onely vpon their <span class="hi">stinted, &amp; set formes of prayer:</span> for the justification of which<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1544">Minist.</span> they bring sundry scriptures as Numb: 6. 2. 3. 24. Deut. 26. 3. 15. Psal. 22. 1. &amp; 92. Luk. 11. 2. Now for our more or­derly proceeding, I will reduce the things they say to three<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1545">Answ.</span> generall heads (vnder which I will consider of the particulars) shewing how in all, and every of them they are mistaken.</p><p>First, in that they do confound, and make all one ordinance, <span class="hi">Blessings, Psalmes, and Prayers.</span></p><p>2. In misinterpreting the scriptures they bring to prove a <span class="hi">set, and stinted form of words</span> to be imposed in prayer.</p><p>3. In concluding (as they do) that if Moses, and Christ might appoynt, and impose a certayn form of words to be vsed for prayer, that then the Bishops in England or others, may vse the same power, and appoint an other form of words so to be v­sed. Of these three in order.</p><p>And first, it is evident, that, howsoever some kinde of <span class="hi">bles­sing,</span> and <span class="hi">prayer</span> be all one, and so may be confounded, yet that solemn kinde of blessing spoken of Numb: 6. and which the PATRIARKS, and PREISTS did vse in their places, was<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1546">I.</span> cleane of an other nature. In prayer the MINISTER stands in place of the PEOPLE, and in their name offers<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1547">II.</span> vp petitions, and thanksgiving to GOD: But in blessing, the Minister stands in the place of God, and in his name pronoun­ceth a blessing, or mercy vpon the people. 2. Whereas this due­ty of prayer may be performed by one equall to another, by an in­feriour to a superiour, yea by a mā to himself: that other of blessing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38236"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=234">[Page 467]</a></span> is alwayes from the greater to the lesser: and therefore the Apostle to the <span class="hi">Hebrews,</span> to shew that the Preisthood of <span class="hi">Melchi-sedek</span> was<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1548">Heb. 7. 17.</span> more excellent then that of <span class="hi">Levi</span> proves it by this, that <span class="hi">Melchise­dec blessed Abraham;</span> taking this for granted <span class="hi">without all contradiction,</span> that <span class="hi">the lesse is blessed of the greater.</span> 3.

In prayers wee speak onely to God: in psalmes to our selves mutually, or one to another. Neyther had Mr Giffard any advātage in the words fol­lowing, where wee are taught to <span class="hi">sing with a grace in our harts to the Lord:</span> for by <span class="hi">singing with a grace</span> is meant such singing as <span class="hi">ministreth grace vnto the hearers,</span> contrary to that <span class="hi">corrupt,</span> or rotten <span class="hi">communi­cation.</span> Eph. 4. 29. And in this, as in all other things, we must propound the glory, and honour of God vnto our selves.</p><p>3. There are very many both of Davids, and others Psalmes,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1556">III.</span> wherein there is no title of prayer: but they are merely to be sung for doctrine, instruction, and meditation, as Psal. 1. 2. and many<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1557">Minist: pag. 192. 593.</span> more. The <span class="hi">Ministers</span> write, that <span class="hi">the most Psalmes</span> that <span class="hi">David made, were sung not onely as meditations, and doctrines, for the instructions of the Ch: but as prayers to God: bycause they are sayd to be sung vnto the Lord:</span> for which purpose they instāce in one onely, which is Psal. 66. 2. 3.</p><p>Well, not to fall to reckoning with them (wherein they and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1558">Answ:</span> I should not agree: for I would except against their picked instāce: Ps. 66. 2. 3. which all mē may see was not sung for prayer, nor vnto the Lord, as they mean, but for instruction, and provocation of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38366"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=235">[Page 468]</a></span> the Church to prayse God) if they consider it, they should have proved, not that some, but that all psalmes are prayers; otherwise they may not be confounded, &amp; made one ordinance, as by them they are. But to come to that which is specially to be observed: even those Psalmes, whose matter is prayer, are not prayers: ney­ther is the singing of them, the outward ordinance, and exercise of praying, And this is the very state of the controversy▪ Which that it may be vnderstood the better, it must be considered, that the very same matter of prayer may be vsed diversly, and so for­med into divers externall ordinances. It may be read, preached, heard, written, sung, or prayed. Now who is so simple, as to say herevpon that reading, preaching, hearing, writing, singing, pray­ing, are all one? If a man read Davids prayer, that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1559">2 Sam. 15 31.</span> <span class="hi">the Lord</span> would <span class="hi">turn the counsayl of Ahitophel into foolishnes:</span> or eyther read, or sing the 6. Psalm where in his prayer, he professeth, that he <span class="hi">causeth his bed</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1560">v: 6.</span> <span class="hi">every night to swim, and waters his couch with teares:</span> or Psalm. 42. that he <span class="hi">remembers God frō the Land of Iorden</span> &amp;c. doth that man therefore<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1561">ver: 6.</span> pray to God, that he would <span class="hi">turn into foolishnes the counsel of Ahitophel?</span> or doth he professe, that he <span class="hi">waters his couch with teares every night,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">remembers God from the Land of Iorden?</span> or is it not evident he reads, and sings those prayers onely for instruction of himself, &amp; others? And so wee read in the inscription of the last named psalm that it was <span class="hi">committed to the sonnes of Corah</span> (not to pray it, which they could not do without folly) but <span class="hi">for instruction.</span> And as truely may it be sayd, that the reading of <span class="hi">Noahs</span> curse, or <span class="hi">Schemies,</span> is cursing,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1562">Gen. 9. 25. 2 Sam. 16. 5.</span> as that the reading, or singing (for singing is, but a reading in tune) of <span class="hi">Davids</span> prayers, is praying.</p><p>But it will here be asked, is it not then lawfull for a man in the singing of Davids psalmes (consisting of prayer) to lift vp his hart, and to have it affected accordingly, as he can apply the matter in them to his present state, &amp; occasions? yes certaynly, it is both lawfull, and godly: but withall it must be remembred, that the quaestion here is not about the inward affection of the heart, but about the outward ordinance: and 2. that a man may so lift vp his heart, and have the affection of prayer, and thanksgiving, in preaching, hearing, writing, reading: and yet not perform the outward exercise, and outward ordinance of prayer, of which our <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38437"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=235">[Page 469]</a></span> quaestion is.</p><p>Lastly, in psalmes there is of necessity required a certayn known form of words, that two or more may sing together: according to the nature of the ordinance, wherein many joyning vocally, do make a concent or harmony. But who will say there is such simple necessity of a set form of words for prayer? wherein one is to utter a voyce, according to the suggestions of the spirit in his heart, and the rest to consent by silence, with saying <span class="hi">Amen.</span> By which it appeareth how vnadvisedly these ministers and others, do thus agayn and agayn vrge set formes of psalmes to prove set formes of prayer.</p><p>Thus much of the first head; the second followeth, in which such scriptures are to be considered of, as are brought to prove a set, &amp; stinted form of words to be imposed for prayer. The principal scri­ptures for this purpose, and vnto which the rest may be reduced, are Numb. 6. 23. 24. Math. 6. 9. Luk. 11. 2.</p><p>It is a troublesome thing that that these Ministers thus vrge the letter of the scriptures: as if the quaestion were not about their sense, and interpretation: which they should prove to be for their stinted service: as they should also disprove our reasons to the contrary. But herein they are vtterly silent, and think it suffici­ent to inculcate the words, <span class="hi">Thus shall ye blesse the children of Israel,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1563">Numb. 6. 23.

But the quaestiō is, whether Moses tyed, and stinted the Preists to that form of words in blessing the people: and whether Christ tyed, and stin­ted his disciples to that very form of words for prayer, so to be vsed by the one, and other, without alteration, addition, or dimi­nution.</p><p>And that this is not the meaning of the holy Ghost, I do mani­fest by these Reasons.</p><p>First, these particles <span class="hi">thus,</span> or <span class="hi">on this manner,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">say,</span> do not vsually<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1565">I.</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38515"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=236">[Page 470]</a></span> in the scriptures designe, or note out the form of words, but the substance of the thing spoken of. Take an instance, or two. When the Lord sent <span class="hi">Moses</span> vnto <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1566">Ex: 4. 22. 23.</span> <span class="hi">Pharaoh King of Aegypt,</span> it was vnder these terms. <span class="hi">Thou shalt say to Pharaoh, thus sayth the Lord, Israel my sonne, my first born: wherefore I say to thee, let my sonne go, that he may serve me:</span> &amp;c. But when Moses came to deliver his message in the next chapt: ver. 1. 2. he doth not ty himself to the self same words, nor vseth them. He did not vnderstand, thou shalt <span class="hi">say</span> to Pharaoh, &amp; <span class="hi">thus sayth</span> the Lord, of the form of words, but of the substance of the thing. The same in effect may be sayd of <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1567">Gen: 24. 12. with 42. &amp;c</span> <span class="hi">Abrahams ser­vant</span> going about <span class="hi">a wife for Isaak,</span> who, relating to Laban the pray­er he made for direction in the buesines, doth not vse the same words, when he tels him what he <span class="hi">sayd</span> in his prayer.

For the words of Christ are not a <span class="hi">permission,</span> as the Ministers insinuate, but an absolute commaundement: neyther is the quae­stion, as they vntruely lay it down, whether it be <span class="hi">lawfull to vse these very words in prayer,</span> but whether it be necessary, and that <span class="hi">when,</span> or whensoever <span class="hi">we pray:</span> for that which Christ intends, he com­mands: and what he commaunds, he cōmaunds to be done, when, or whensoever, wee pray.

Indeed in preaching we must ever make the scriptures our text, and groundwork, and must speak accor­ding vnto them: and may take a verse, two, or more, &amp; vse them, even word for word, as they fit our occasion, and may be apply­ed to our purpose: so in praying we must make this praescript e­ver (as it were) the text, and groundwork of our prayer, &amp; must pray according vnto it: and may vse a petition, two, or more, or all in, or of it, even word, for word, if so the holy Ghost (by whose immediate teachings, and suggestions all our requaests must be put vp) do direct vs, and that wee can apply the same words to our present occasions, and needs. The same which I have sayd touching the preaching of the word, may be added in respect of the administration of the sacraments.</p><p>The Apostle writing to the Corinthians about the Lords sup­per, advertiseth them, that <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1579">1 Cor. 11. 23.</span> <span class="hi">he received of the Lord, that which he de­livered vnto them.</span> Now he that looks into the 3. Evangelists, that mention this institution, and compares eyther one of them with<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1580">Math. 27. 26. Mark. 14. 22. Luk 23. 19.</span> another, or Paul with any of them, he shall finde, that the ordi­nance stands not at all in the prescript form of words, wherein they all differ ech from others. It is evident that the Lord admi­nistred this supper but once: &amp; that in a certayn form of words. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38843"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=237">[Page 473]</a></span> And that which the Lord delivered vnto his disciples, these four pen-men of the Holy Ghost delivered to the Churches. Now the great liberty, which they vse in respect of forms of words▪ (where­in they differ ech from others) shewes, how litle this institution▪ and ordinance stands vpon such stints: as also how far it is from the meaning of Christ, that the Churches should be thus short ty­ed in the vse of them. The same may be sayd of the ordinance of prayer, by Christ given to his Church: wherein the two Evange­lists, that mention it, do vse the same liberty: as most likely would the other two also have done, in respect of forms of words, had they made mention of it.</p><p>But graunt, that the words of Christ, <span class="hi">pray after this manner, &amp; when you pray, say,</span> are to be interpreted, as these men would have it, yet do I except agaynst their service-book in a double respect. The first is, that the reading of prayers vpon a book hath no justifica­tion from them. If it be sayd, that to commit a certayn form of words to the memory, and from it to vtter them, and to read thē vpon a book, are all one, I deny the consequence: and though I approve not of the former, yet is the latter far the worse. For (be­sides, that he, that readeth, hath an other speaking to him (as it were) even he, whose wryting he reades, and himselfe speaks not to God, but to the people, to whom he reads) in the former, there is a kynde of vse, though not lawfull of the gift of memory: where in the other book-praying there is no vse of that, or any o­ther gift.</p><p>Secondly, it followes not, that bycause the Lord Iesus might impose a set forme of words to be vsed for prayer, that therefore the Lord Bbs of England may impose an other set form so to be vsed. The consequence is notably both erroneous, and presump­tuous. So bold indeed are they, and so high do they advance themselves in their ordinances, and impositions. Bycause the Lord hath separated one day from the rest, and made it holy, therefore they wil also make other holy dayes: bycause Christ hath set down canons, and constitutions for the government of his Church, therefore they also will have their canons, and constitutions: bycause he hath appointed a form of administring the sacramēts, therefore they may appoynt another form, yea and that such a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e38879"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=1037&amp;page=238">[Page 474]</a></span> one as altereth, and inovateth the very nature of the words of in­stitution. For where Christ would have the words of institution published, and preached, <span class="hi">this is my body which is given for you,</span> they<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1581">Luke 22. 19. 1 Cor: 11. 24.</span> turn this preaching into a prayer, <span class="hi">the body of our Lord Iesus Christ, was given for the, preserv thy body and soul into eternall life</span> &amp;c. repeating the same also to every severall communicant: which Christ would have pronounced once for all, according to the nature of the or­dinance. And thus they will <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1582">Ezech: 43. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">set their thresholds</span> by the Lords <span class="hi">thre­shouldes,</span> and <span class="hi">their postes by his postes:</span> and rather then they will want rowm for their own, they wil pare of part his, yea wholy dimolish them. If the Lord Iesus appoynt one ordinance for his Church, they will appoynt an other; and surely, so they may lawfully: if they be, as they are reputed, &amp; protend themselves, Lord Bishops, and Arch Bishops of the Church, and spirituall Lords, over Gods heritage.</p><p>To these things I will adde a few reasons agaynst this read stin­ted service, and so conclude both the matter, and the book.</p><p>And first it cānot be an ordināce of Christ, bycause the Church<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1583">I.</span> may perfectly, and entyrely worship God, without it, with all the parts of holy and spirituall worship; as did the Apostolick Chur­ches for many years before any such leiturgy was devised, &amp; im­posed: and as do many Churches now: and as appeares by that which is done before &amp; after sermons, where no such stint is read of, what may be done at all times, and in all places, where able &amp; lawfull ministers of the new testament, are.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1584">II.</span></p><p>As the administrations of the publique prayers of the Church is a principall duty of the minister, for which a speciall gift and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note1585">Isa: 56. 7. Math: 21. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>3.
