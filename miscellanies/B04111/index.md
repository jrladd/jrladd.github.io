_[figure]_

ALL you that delight to ſpend ſome time

with a hey down down a down down

A merry Song for to ſing,

Vnto me draw néer and you ſhall hear

how little John went a begging.

As Robin Hood walked the Foreſt along.

with a hey, &c.

And all his Yeomandrée,

Sayes Robin ſome of you muſt a begging go

and little John it muſt be thée.

Sayes John if I muſt a begging go,

with a hey, &c.

I will have a palmers wéed,

With a ſtaff and a Coat and bags of all ſort

the better then I ſhall ſpéed.

Come give me now a bag for my bread,

with a hey, &c.

And another for my chéeſe

And one for a peny when a; I get any.

that nothing I may léeſe.

Now little John he is a begging gone,

with a hey.

Séeking for ſome relief,

But of all the Beggers he met on the ſtay,

little John he was the chief,

But as he was walking himſelf alone

with a hey, &c.

Four beggers he chanced to ſpy,

Some deaf and ſome blind & ſome came behind

ſayes John heres brave company.

Good morrow ſaid John my brethren dear

with a hey, &c.

Good fortune I had you to ſée,

Which way do you go pray let me know,

for I want ſome company,

O what is here to do then ſaid little John

with a hey.

Why rings all thoſe bells ſaid he.

What dog is a hanging come let us be ganging

that we the truth may ſée,

Here is no dog a hanging then one of them ſaid

with a hey &c.

Good fellow we tell unto thée,

But here is one  [...] wil give us chéeſe & bread

and it may be one ſingle peny.

We have brethren in London another he ſaid

with a hey, &c.

So have we in Coventry

In Barwick and Dover and all the world over

but nere a crookt car [...]il like thée

_[figure]_

THerefore ſtand thee back thou crooked care

with a hey.

And take that knock on the crown,

Nay ſaid little Iohn Ile not yet be gone

for about will I have with you round,

Now have at you all then ſaid little Iohn,

with a hey.

If you be ſo full of your blows,

Fight on all four and nere give ore,

whether you be friend or foes

John nipped the dumb and made him to rore

with a hey:

And the blind that could not ſée,

And be that a Cripple has been ſeven pears

he made them run faſter then he,

And flinging then all againſt the wall,

with a hey.

With many a ſturdie bang

It made Iohn ſing to bear the gold ring

Whi [...]h again the walls cryed twang

Then he got out of the beggers Cloak

with a hey.

Thrée hundred pound in gold

Good Fortune had I then ſaid little Iohn

ſuch a good fight to behold

But what found he in a beggers bag

with a hey

But three hundred pound and three

If I drink water while this doth laſt

then until death may I dye

And my begging trade I now will give o're

with a hey, &c.

My fortune hath bin ſo good,

Therefore Ile not ſtay but I will away

to the Forreſt of we cry Sherwood.

But when to the Forreſt of Sherwood he came

with a hey

he quickly there did ſee

His Maſter good bold Robin Hood

and all his company,

What news what news then ſaid Robin Hood

with a hey.

Come little Iohn tell unto me,

How haſt thou ſped with thy beggers trade

for that I fain would ſee,

No news but good then ſaid little Iohn

with a hey,

With begging ful wel I have ſped

Six hundred and three I have here for thee

in ſilver and gold ſo te [...]

Then Robin Hood took little John, by ye hand,

with a hey,

And danced about the Oak tree,

If we drink water while this doth haſt

then an it death may we die.

So to conclude my merry new Song,

with a hey.

All you that delight it to ſing

Tis of Robin Hood that Archer good

and how little John went a begging
