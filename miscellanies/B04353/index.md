O Mother thave been a Batchellor

This twelve and twenty years,

And Ize have often been a wooing:

And yet cham never the near:

Joan Gromball cheel ha none of me

Ize look ſo like a Lowr:

But I vaith cham as proper a Man as ſhe

Zhe needs not be Zo ſtout.

She Zaies if ize coud dance and ſing,

As Thomas Miller con,

Or cut a Cauper, as little Jack Taylor

O how cheed love me then;

But zoft and fair, chil none of that,

I vaith cham not Zo nimble

The Taylors have nought to trouble his thoughts

But his needle and his thimble.

O Zon th' art of lawful Age

And a jolly tide Boy

Ide have thee try her one again

She can but ſay nay:

Then O Gramarcy Mother

Chill Zet a good Vaces of the matter

Chill dreſs up my Zelf as fine as a Dog,

And chill have a freſh bout at her.

And firſt chill put on my Zunday Parrel,

That lac'd about the Quarters;

VVith a pair of Buckram Slops

And a Vlanting pair of Garters

VVith my Sword tide vaſt to my Zide

And my Grandfathers Dugen Dagger

And a Peacocks Veather in my Capp,

Then ah how Iſe ſhall ſwagger.

Nay take the Loekrum Napkin Son,

To wipe thy ſnotty noſe,

Tis no matter vor that chilli Snort is out

And Vlurt it athwart my Cloaths:

Dv's bod kins nay ſie away

I prethee Son do not ſo,

Be mannerly Son till thou canſt tell

VVeather ſheel ha thee or no.

But Sirrah Mother hark a while,

VVhos that that comes ſo near:

'Tis Joan Grombal, hold thy peace

For fear that ſhe do hear:

Nay out be ſhe chill dreſs my words,

In Zuch a Scholards Grace,

But virſt of all ſhall take my Hands,

And lay them athwart her Vace.

Good morrow my Honey my Sugar-Candy

My little pretty Mouſe,

Cha hopes thy Vather and Mother be well

At home at thine own Houſe

Ich am came Vart to ſhow my mind

Cham Zure, thou knoweſt my Arrant:

Zum ſay Iug that I mun ha thee,

O no good Sir, I warrant.

You muſt (Sir Clown) is for the King,

And not for ſuch a mome,

You might have ſaid by your leave fair Maid

And let your (muſt) alone.

Ich am no more a Clown that vlat

Cham in my Zunday Apparel

Ich came vor Love and I pray ſo tak't

The hopes the will not quarrall.

Joan.

Robin doſt thou love me ſo well,

Robin.

I vaith abomination,

VVhy then you ſhould have fram'd your wodrs

Into a finer faſhion.

Vine Vaſhions and Vine  [...]eeches  [...],

As Schollards Volks can Vtter,

Chad wrather ſpeak but twa words plain

Than half a ſcore and ſtutter.

Robin.

Chave Land, chave Houſe, chave twa v [...] Be [...]

That's better then fine Speeches,

Joan.

'Tis a ſign that Fortune favours Fools,

She let them have ſuch Riches,

Robin.

Hark how ſhe comes upon me now,

I do wiſh it be a good Zine,

Joan.

He that will ſteal any wit from thee

Had need to riſe betime.

Iſe, Vaith Iſe am no vool Iſe Zay

Iſe think you Zud know better:

Doſt thou think Iſe not know I pray,

Good ſpeech and manners better:

'Tis ſure you know not if you did

You'd nee'r have been a Lover.

Nay nay, my Dear, nay nay udzlid

Why mun not I diſcover.

What long in ſecret i'ſe ha kept

And woud ha longer done it

Had not my Paſſion been Zo heap'd

Iſe had no more Room for it.

And are you in Love as you Zay.

Yes Vaith and Troth Iſe Zware it

Then prithee Robin ſet the day

And wees ee'n both be Married.
