## 1\. The Plovvmans Art in VVoeing

The brisk young plowman doth believe

If he were put to tryal,

There's not a maid in all the Shire

Could give him the denyal.

Tune of, Cupid's Trappan.

_[figure]_

I Am a young man that do follow the Plow

But of late I have found out an art,

And can when I pleaſe with abundance of eaſe,

Deprive any maid of her heart, brave boys

Deprive &c.

To think how they'l yield as I walk in the field

My thinks is ſo pleaſant to me,

I long to be nigh her who'l burn like a fire,

If ſhe but my favour doth ſee, brave boys

If ſhe &c.

Such wenches I think muſt be certainly mad,

Whoſe hearts are betray'd with a ſmile,

But they quickly find ſuch a change in my mind

That will them of all pleaſure beguile, brave

That &c.

And will make them look pale like maidens ſo ſtale

That for a good Husband doth long,

And this unto me ſuch pleaſure will be

That I ſhall thereof make a ſong, brave

That &c.

For who can delight in a thing that is fond

'Tis a thing that I never could do,

My paſſion is gone when ſhe doates upon John,

Then another Girl I muſt go woe, brave

That I &c.

And in a months ſpace it will be her caſe

If ſhe can be eaſily wonn,

To mourn and bewail beneath the Milk-Pale,

And to cry ſhe's forſook and undone, brave

And to cry &c.

I could ne'r underſtand there's a man in the land

Could delight in whats eaſily gain'd,

But if it be ſo that Love they long ſtow,

Then they'r paſſion muſt ſurely be feignd, brave

Then &c.

Then give me the wench that has ſo much ſence

When a Youngſter doth come upon tryal.

Will ſo cunningly deal that his heart ſhe may ſteal;

And ſeemingly give the denyall, brave

And &c.

She ſurely will find young men be more kind,

If ſhe be but ſtrange and untoward,

For men like the fire do burn with deſire,

If they meet with a maid that is froward, brave

If &c.

But it is the faſhion throughout all the nation,

And chiefly in Country Townes,

Men maidens beguil who are won with a ſmile

And then they'r deſtroy'd with their frowns brave

And &c.

And it may be ſaid there's not a milk maid,

Although ſhe be never ſo fair,

But if once I begin, her heart I would win

And by my fair words would betray her, brave

And by &c.

It is a rare thing to hear the Girls ſing

Oh! my love hath forſaken me quite,

And for his dear ſake my heart it doth ake,

I languiſh by day and by night, brave boys

I languiſh &c.

As I follow the Plow my thinks I ſee how

They look pale and their lips they do tremble

Cauſe they were miſtaken and are forſaken

By Youngſters that much did diſſemble, brave.

By Youngſters &c.

I will have tother bout and without any doubt

Ile compaſs the thing I deſire,

For I cannot well paſs if I meet with a Laſs,

Till her heart it be ſet on a fire, brave

Till her &c.

There's Marget and Jone who ſtill lye all alone

But ile venture to lay twenty ſhilling,

If a motion I make to cure their heart ake

To lye with me both will be willing, brave

To lye &c.

There's Suſan and Kate that long for to ha't

And are vigorous in their deſire,

But before they are mad let ſome luſty young lad

Make haſte and Extinguiſh their fire, brave

Make. &c.
