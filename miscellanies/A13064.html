It increaſeth in a lighte and grauelly grounde, and for the moſt part in a ſaltie ground. It alſo de­lighteth in a wateriſh or moyſt ground, and all the yere long loueth to ſucke humiditie. Alſo ſome thinke that doung is hurtfull vnto it.</span> We haue ſayde, that ſaltilhe ground is brooked well of this Palme tree. Therefore where no ſuche ſoyle is, they ſprinkle ſalte, not at the rootes, but a litle from it, &amp;c. Theſe after the ſame maner maye be ſpoken concerning fayth, and the Church. Fayth ſprin­geth in the <span class="hi">grauelly</span> and <span class="hi">ſaltiſh</span> ground, that is, in a con­trite or broken heart through acknowledging of ſinne, and as the Palme trees haue neede of warmth and moyſture, ſo ſayth is kindled by the holy Ghoſt, and is watered by the ryuers of the Goſpell. And it is hurte of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1493"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=8">[Page 7]</a></span> doung, that is, by corruption of doctrine, &amp; the woundes of the conſcience. Furthermore as the Palme tree is fruitfull, ſo fayth is not fruitles, but effectuall by loue. And as the Palme tree beareth waighte of any thing layde vpon her, &amp; the more ſhe is borne downe, ſo muche more hyer ſhe ryſeth agayne: ſo fayth is the vanquiſher of ſorowes, &amp; amidſt afflictions ſpecially ſhineth. Final­ly, the leaues of the Palme tree neuer fall of, ſo the fruits of the teachers are euerlaſting, as in the 15. chapter of John it is moſt comfortably ſayd: <span class="hi">In this is my father glo­rified, if ye be made my diſciples, and that you beare muche fruite, and that your fruite do continue.</span></p></div><div class="verse" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1_div.4"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.1.4. </span><span class="head"><span class="q">‘<span class="citbibl">Verſe 4</span> So ſhall not the vngodly do, but as the chaffe ſhall they be, which the winde driues to and fro.’</span> <span class="q">‘<span class="citbibl">Verſe 5</span> Therefore ſhall not the vngodly abide in iudge­ment, neither ſhall ſinners ſtande in the congregation of the righteous.’</span></span></h4><p>EVen as he compareth the godly ones, which are the members of the true Church, vnto the flouriſhing and fruitefull Palme tree: So doth he compare the vn­godly contemners or enimies of the Goſpel, vnto a moſt light and vile thing, namely chaffe which is toſſed with the winde. But as the firſt figure is full of conſolation, ſo this other is fearefull. And were not the multitude of the vngodly ones more ſturdie then the rockes ſtanding in the ſea, and not perſwaded in any age, although they are beaten vpon with continuall waues, vndoubtedly beholding this heauy and ſorowfull figure, they woulde earneſtly quake for feare. But the prophane ſecuritie of the vngodly is ſignified in the 48. chapter of Geneſis: <span class="hi">Thy ſinne ſhall lye or reſt till it be reuealed.</span> For the vn­godly feele not fearefulnes and humbling of themſelues, till beeing ſuppreſſed with plagues, they fall headlong <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1528"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=9">[Page 8]</a></span> into eternall deſtruction, and as it were vayne chaffe, ſhall be caſt into neuer ending tormentes.

And yet notwithſtan­ding vayne chaffe do beare ſway, and carry ſtately coun­tenaunces, vntill that they be throwne headlong from the toppe of their glory into preſent and euerduring cala­mities.

Certaine it is that the name of iudgement is often times taken for a function or office. This is therfore the ſenſe, that the vngodly ones, as <span class="hi">Annas, Caiphas,</span> and others which beare a ſway in the world as Phariſees and Sa­duces (euer warring with God, and holding battell with the true Churche, yea although they ſeeme no­tably to be ſenſed with princely powers agaynſt all chaunces of fortune) yet they ſhall be caſt out of their ſtations, and ſhall be ſeperated from the true Churche, as thoſe which are accurſed of God. And although nowe and then puniſhments are deferred, and God doth not by and by execute this iudgement: yet as it is ſayd, <span class="hi">Sera tamen tacitis, paena venit pedibus.</span> Although late, yet puniſhment ſtealeth on. For God doth at length iudge betweene the conflictes of the true Churche, and hypo­crites, the blaſphemous part extinguiſhed: as the here­tikes of all ages are ſubuerted, the Churche remayning unmoueable, not ſhrinking out of place, nor yet out of <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1560"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=9">[Page 9]</a></span> order.

The kingdome of Chriſt is the gouernmente of Chriſt, collecting vnto him his Church by the Miniſterie of the Goſpel in all ages of the world, and delyuering the ſame from ſinne and eternall death, &amp; ſanctifying the ſame in geuing his h<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ly ſpirit, that it may bé his euerlaſting inheritance, and defending and gouerning y<sup>e</sup> ſame marueilouſly in this life, that it would truely call vpon him, and acknowledge prayers hearde through him, and to worſhip God, rayſing from death to life, and eternall glorye. Let vs therefore not onely diſcern the perſon of this king from <span class="hi">Cyrus, Alexander, Auguſtus</span> and ſuch like: but alſo the kingdome of Chriſt from all Common wealthes and Gouernmentes. For although it be certaine that mightie Princes (by whoſe wiſdome and vertue kingdomes are ordered) be ſtyrred vp and helped by God, as <span class="hi">Herodotus</span> rightly ſpeaketh of the Perſian kinge, <span class="hi">That the kingdome of Perſia increaſed vnder the gouernment of God, and the kings them­ſelues redilie folowing him.</span> Yet <span class="hi">Cyrus, Alexander▪ Au­guſtus</span> and ſuch like, were miſerable men, ſubiecte vnto <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2249"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=16">[Page 23]</a></span> ſinne and <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eath, neither did the Godhead mingle it ſelſe with their naturs.

Thus farre I haue ſpoken a few thinges, touching the diffe­rence betwixt Chriſt and other kinges: Now let vs di­ſtinguiſh y<sup>e</sup> kingdomes of Chriſt from other kingdomes by euident boundes, as it is in the Law of gouerning territortes. For they differ in forme of gouernment, in be­nefites and ſtabilitie. For other kingdomes are fortifyed with riches and armies, and dee puniſh offenders with the ſworde or with corporall force: but Chriſtes king­dome is gouerned by the voice of the goſpell, by y<sup>t</sup> which God is effectuall, and doth regenerate many vnto life e­uerlaſting. Moreouer, in other kingdomes the chiefe thinges are peace of body, and externall diſcipline.

Secondly, that he might make ſatiſfacti­on for our ſinnes, vpon the croſſe, and geue his holie spirit and euerlaſtinge ſaluation. With this doctrine are our mindes (through the holie Ghoſt) enflamed, that firſt they might trulie loue God: for we ſee him to burne in ſo great loue to­wardes vs, that for our ſaluation, he ſpared not his owne onely Sonne. Moreouer, that our mindes might embrace the ſonne as a ſufficient ſacrifice for our ſinnes, wherewith onely the Fa­ther would be pacified. By this faith we obtaine remiſſion of all our ſinnes, and willingly obey our Redeemer, calling vs vnto Baptiſme, vnto his worde, vnto his ſupper, and exhortinge vs vnto loue. And we are aſſiſted by the holy spirit, that our harts being chaunged, do beginne to hate ſinne, and not to nowriſh ſinne anie more, or be therewith delighted as before time, and with all induſtrie might beſtowe theire whole life in the true obedience of God.

But ſome man perhaps would <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> in this place, whether the deume nature be alone in <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span>, or no? I anſwere, ther are many cauſes why the Mediator is god and man, whereof I will nowe recyte ſome. The Medi­ator is God, to thend he may delyuer our prayers and worſhippings vnto the Father and enter into the ſecret counſell or the godheade. For God as touchinge his ma­ieſtie,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note43">1. Tim. 6.</span> <span class="hi">dwelleth in a light vnaprochable,</span> and is a conſuming fire. The ſame Mediator is man, to the end he might talke with vs familierly, and ſhewe vs the Father, be­cauſe we are not able to abide him ſpeaking in his ma­ieſtie. Furthermore this Mediator is man, by reaſon of the conflict and paſſion which he ſuffered, and he is God by reaſon of the victorie and tryumphe in his reſurrecti­on and aſcention. For the alone nature diuine can not ſuffer nor dye. Alſo the alone nature humaine is not the ouer commer of the world, that is, of ſinne, death and the deuil. Finally the Mediator is man, to the end he may do the office of a prieſt, which perteyneth vnto the doctrine and ſacrifice. The ſame mediator is God, to the end hee may do the offices of prieſthood touchinge interceſſion, and of a kinge, touching victorie triumphes, gyftes, and gouernment of the church. And although theſe caſes can­not throughly be ſeene, and are more nearer beholden in that ſame lyfe eternall: yet notwithſtanding it is need­full that in this lyfe we thinke vpon the beginninges of this wiſdome, (that the admiration and deſire after the felowſhip with God) might be inflamed in vs, and that as thankful vnto him we ſhould praiſe him in theſe great benefites that the onely begotten Sonne of the eternall Father tooke vpon him nature of man, to ouercome death, and reſtore to vs lyfe, and gather together his e­ternall Church and be an interceſſor for vs.</p></div><div class="verse" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.8"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2464"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=18">[Page 27]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.8. </span><span class="head"><span class="q">‘<span class="citbibl">Verſe. 8.</span> Aske of me and I will geue the Nations for thine inheritance, and the coſtes of the carth for thy poſſeſ­ſions.’</span></span></h4><p>SO greate plentie and abundance of doctrine is there in this pſalme, that it cannot be comprehended in many volumes of comentaries. Therfore I ſhalbe con­tented to entreate vpon the ſpeciall places. And there are in this verſe three chiefe and notable places. The firſt a Teſtimonie of the deuine nature of the Meſſias. The ſe­cond a doctrine of the callinge of the Gentiles. And the thirde a difference of the kingdome of Chriſt, and other kingdomes touching theſe places, I will be briefe, leaſt that my comment growe too greate.</p><p>Therefore like as the Epiſtle of <span class="hi"><span class="hi">S.</span> Paule. Hebr. 1.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note44">Heb. 1. et 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> doth excellently vrge the efficacie of thoſe wordes in the next verſe, to confirme the diumitie of Chriſt. <span class="hi">To which of the Angels ſaid God at any time, Thou art my ſonne, this day haue I begotten thee?</span> So we both may and ought to apply this verſe to confirme our ſelues, and confute the <span class="hi">Arrians, <span class="hi">To which of the Angelles ſaide God at any time? Aske of me, and I will giue thee nations for thine inheritance, and the coſtes of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</span></span> For in deede the Angels are not Lords ouer mankinde, but are created for the ſeruice of God and his Church. But this Lorde is heire of all things, becauſe by him, and for him, all things were created. Let vs therefore remember this te­ſtimonie, and let vs adioyne the ſame vnto the other ſentences, which confirme the diuinitie of Chriſt, and confute blaſphemers. Moreouer ſo ofte as we ſpeake of the calling of the Gentiles, let theſe three things be chie­fly conſidered: Firſt, how great the force of the mercy of God is, gathering his Church of the miſerable maſſe or heape of Heatheniſh men, which are Idolaters, defiled with wicked ſlaughters, luſtes, theft, lyings, periuries, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2510"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=19">[Page 28]</a></span> and finally, with ſuch filthines, as my tong both trem­bleth and eſcheweth to ſpeake of. And it is profitable in theſe hiſtories to conſider the greatnes of the mercy of God. We vſe to maruell leſſe, that God reuealed this Goſpell vnto the Jewiſh people, amongſt whom had remayned ſome doctrine touching God, and with whom there was ſome honeſt diſcipline. But let vs compare <span class="hi">Rome</span> in <span class="hi">Neros</span> time, vnto <span class="hi">Nazareth.</span> Firſt, the true God was altogether vnknowne at <span class="hi">Rome,</span> moſte men euery where were Athe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ſts or godleſſe men: the reſidue wickedly worſhipped idols. Secondly, the whole Citie was full of moſt filthie luſtes, which were thought to be pleaſures, permitted, not worthy of puniſhment. Thirdly, money, bribing, and vſuries, were had in price of prayſe. Laſtly, no reuerence towards God, no ſhame­faſtneſſe, neither regarde of any trueth and iuſtice. And yet God commaundes his Church to be gathered vnto him euen in ſuch a Citie, and ſuch then were the maners almoſt throughout all the world. In this example is the greatnes of Gods mercy ſeene, that vnto ſuche perſons where as diſcipline was ſo vtterly extinguiſht, euen the worde of God doth <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ounde, calling them vnto repen­taunce, and offering them ſaluation. And at firſt it was thought a matter vnworthy amongſt the Jewes, that the Goſpell ſhould be preached and diſperſed amongſt thoſe curſed people, which liued in great filthines, with­out all diſcipline or good order. Here vpon happened thoſe conflictes of <span class="hi">Paule,</span> when he affirmed that the Goſpell pertayned to the Gentiles, and that free remiſſion of ſinnes, for Chriſte<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> ſake, was offered vnto all them which did repent. A great and wholeſome conſolation is it vnto the godly, to thinke vppon this greatnes of Gods mercy, which is ſpecially ſeene when we conſider how God diſperſeth his Goſpell amongſt th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ſe monſters of men, as then were the heathen, and as now are ma­ny. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2555"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=19">[Page 29]</a></span> Let vs knowe that this mercy of God is taught vn­to vs, ſo often as mētion is made of gathering a Church, from among the Gentiles.</p><p>Secondly, the calling of the Gentiles is an excellent Teſtimony touching the whole effect of the Goſpell, which conſiſteth in the vniuerſall preaching of repen­taunce, and in an vniuerſall promiſe of grace. For, as God calleth all men vnto repentaunce, ſo vnto all which repent, and beleeue in his ſonne, doth he aſſuredly giue remiſſion of ſinnes, and requireth of vs that we beleeue this voyce of the goſpell, and call vpon him, in this fayth.</p><p>Thirdly, the calling of the Gentiles teacheth vs the abrogation of the lawe, and confuteth the opinion of the Phariſees, which imagineth that men are iuſt, through the lawe, and the ceremonies of <span class="hi">Moſes:</span> But there is no diſcourſe equall vnto the greatnes of things which the doctrine touching calling of the Gentiles comprehendeth. Therefore I am nowe more briefe, and do procéede vn­to the third place.</p><p>I haue declared before, that the kingdome of Chriſte differeth from other kingdomes, in forme of gouerne­ment, in benefites, and in ſtabilitie. Now (if it pleaſe you) let vs adde the fourth difference, which is taken as of the endes. For in déede other kingdomes haue their limites and boundes, as the kingdome of <span class="hi">Rome</span> in the time of <span class="hi">Auguſtus</span> ſtretched vnto <span class="hi">Euphrates.</span> For the <span class="hi">Romanes</span> neuer had any ſucceſſe in their warres with the <span class="hi">Perſians</span> and <span class="hi">Parthians,</span> and other people of the Eaſt partes, as the Hiſtories of <span class="hi">Craſsius</span> and <span class="hi">Iulia­nus,</span> and others do witneſſe. And yet although the Ro­miſh Monarchy contayned many Prouinces, yet was ſhe not the Lady of all Nations. But this our king hath moſt ample boundes, becauſe he ruleth from ſea to ſea, and from the floode vnto the ende of the world, as it is written in the Pſalme 72. But to what ende is al this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2607"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=20">[Page 30]</a></span> recitall of the boundes of the kingdome of Chriſt? For­ſooth to this purpoſe, that we maye vnderſtande, that the Church is not as a common wealth tyed vnto cer­tayne kingdomes, and compriſed within certayne li­mittes. But all perſons whatſoeuer they be, which call vpon God in faith and in true acknowledgemente of Chriſt, and doe flee from idolatrie, are the members of Gods Church. Then are not the olde, neither yet the la­ter <span class="hi">Donatiſtes</span> to be heard, which compriſe the Church within narrow limites or bondes. For as <span class="hi">Donatus</span> and they which procéeded from him, haue preſcribed y<sup>e</sup> church within the onely boundes of <span class="hi">Aphrica,</span> So the Pontifi­call Doctors cry out, that the Church is bound vnto an ordinarie ſucceſſion of Biſhoppes, and that there is no true members of the Church out of their Pontificall go­uernement. But let vs ſo ſurely perſwade our ſelues, that the Church is a congregation of the godly ones, diſ­perſed throughout the whole world, which are tied to the worde deliuered by the Apoſtles, and that there are the members of the Church, whereſoeuer any doe embrace the pure doctrine of the goſpell. So at this day vnder the Turkes gouernment, and vnder the gouernment of other kinges and biſhops, enemies to the pure doctrine of the goſpel, there are ſome godly perſons diſperſed eue­ry where. But peraduenture ſome man would ſay, that all nations are not the heritage of Chriſt. Neither that Chriſt doth holde all men vnder the yoke of his gouern­ment. There is nothing that wee can ſo eaſilie abſolue. For Chriſt is either Lord and Ruler of the gentiles in this reſpecte, that he might reſtore vnto them righteouſ­nes and life, eyther els is he the fearefull iudge of the wicked and diſobedyent. Therefore, they which wil not imbrace Chriſt as a Sauiour, ought to feare Chriſt as the Iudge ouer quick and dead. But it is now time that we come vnto the Expoſition of thoſe verſes which re­mayne.</p></div><div class="verse" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.9"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2648"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=20">[Page 31]</a></div><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.9. </span><span class="head"><span class="q">‘<span class="citbibl">Verſe 9.</span> He ſhall bruiſe them with an iron rod, and hee ſhall breake them in peeces like a Potters veſſell.’</span></span></h4><p>ALthough this verſe may by a ſubtile reaſon▪ bee ap­plyed vnto the miniſtery of the goſpel, wherof Chriſt ſpeaketh. <span class="hi">Iohn 16.

For there are foure proper tokens diſcerninge godly teachers from the vngodly ones. For the godly miniſters of the church do cure the woundes of the conſciences, that is, of doubt, and of diſ­paire. But the falſe prophetes do both doubt themſelues of Gods will, and also leaue theire auditory in doubting, as the <span class="hi">Areopagites</span> in the councell of <span class="hi">Trident,</span> do bidde all men to abide in doubtfullnes, and do wipe out all this article in the <span class="hi">Simbole</span> or <span class="hi">Creede. viz.

The rage of the vngodly tea­chers doth farre paſſe theſe, which ſo ſpare no ſex nor age of perſon that they had rather bringe Heauen and earth together, and defile there contrie with ciuill blood­ſhed, then to loſe theire opinion, honour, pleaſures and riches.

This cauillation will I refute, becauſe of the ruder ſorte: both vertues is preſcribed, confeſsion and patience. For as it is nede full to defend a truecauſe, ſpeciallie of doctrine, by a cleare confeſsion, ſo therewith ought we to be pre­pared in minde to ſuffer violence, if the Magiſtrate be either negligent or cruell in doing his office.

This example in manie affaires of our life, it is profitable to folowe. If anie man hurt or hin<span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span>er thy good name▪ it is not neceſſarie for thee to keepe ſilence, but thou maieſt innocentlie excuſe thy ſelf, and refute thine aduerſa­rie. If he geue no place being refuted, neither the arbitrators or iudges defend thee, as they ought, <span class="hi">Dauid,</span> by his example doth comforte thee, that thou maieſt know why thou muſt haue patience, and after what maner it pleaſeth God. I doe alſo vnder­ſtand howe it is by <span class="hi">Dauid</span> reaſoned in the 8. verſe thus. <span class="hi">Iudge me O Lord, according to thy righteouſnes.</span> But the application of this ſaying with other ſentences is eaſie and familier vnto him which vnderſtandeth the boundes of humilitie and of glorie. <span class="hi">Glorie</span> is the teſtimonie of our owne conſcience iudginge o­thers rightlie, and of other mens iudging vs rightly. <span class="hi">Humilitie,</span> is a vertue wherewith acknowledginge our owne infirmitie, we geue God the Glorie, and in our vocation lyue obedient with confidence in Gods helpe, and in time of puniſhment, confeſſe that we are iuſtly puniſhed.

So <span class="hi">Dauid</span> rightly, and without arrogan­cie, declared that hee tooke not the kingdome and Iuriſdiction vpon him perforce, but was obedient vnto the calling of God, and that hee exerciſed not priuate deſires in ruling, when as <span class="hi">Semeus</span> obiected, that <span class="hi">Dauid</span> for gouernment ſake, both violated the Law, and godlines. This alſo may be anſwered, that we muſt make a difference betweene the righteouſ­nes of the perſon, and the righteouſnes of the cauſe.

Vnto this ſpeciall work, namely (the aduauncement of the doctrine) ought all pollicies and degrees of life to ſerue.

He prayeth that he may be reduced, and is therwith pre­pared vnto obedience. He is willing to obey gods will, yea though he be not reduced, and yet doeth he not caſt a­way faith touching ſorgeuenes of his ſinnes, neither pre­ſcribeth he any maner of time. Yea, he wiſheth not to be reduced againe, if he might deliuer his ſonne from eter­nall damnation: rather then ſo reduced, that thereby he ſhould for euer and for euer deſtroy his ſon, and a great multitude of his Citizens.</p><p>This maner of deliuerance grieued <span class="hi">Dauid</span> more then the loſſe of his kingdome. But he knew that when God brought him back again, he muſt obay his wil, and that through zeale towardes God and his Church, our affections muſt needes be vanquiſhed. So Religion in vs, and pietie towardes God and his Church, vanquy­ſheth other motions of the minde. But where he ſpea­keth (of <span class="hi">the aſcending of God on high</span>) that may be vnder­ſtoode by relation, and not abſolutely ſo in deede. For then is God exalted in our ſight, when he is knowen of vs aright, called vpon, and worſhipped according to his worde deliuered, and when we reiect all falſe opinions, and worſhippinges which are wide from the rule of his deuine Inſtitution. Wherefore, ſeeing that ſtudies af­ter the heauenly doctrine, in tune of tumultes wax more fainte, and the due honour of God might ſo be hindered, <span class="hi">Dauid,</span> being very carefull for theſe ſpeciall benefites, with a godly zeal craued reſtitution into his kingdome, not to ſeek after vanitie and pleaſures, but that he might againe gather together and reſtore the Schooles &amp; Chur­ches ſcattered and defaced with ciuil warres.

And althoughe I miſlike not this Interpretation: Yet I doe better allowe of the ſimple meaning and effecte, which the proprie­tie of the phraſe bringes foorth. Therefore this Pſalme conteineth a Figure of the Church, which is like vnto a ſillie birde caſt out of her neſte, and laide foorth for all maner perilles and daungers of death. For in very deede, the Church liueth as an exile in this world, and ſetleth her abode in trobleſome do­minions, as it were in <span class="hi">Medeas</span> boſome. And nei­ther liues ſhe in exilement, and wandereth without any certaine reſting place, but is as an open pray vn­to all hazardes of ſodaine dangers. For ſhe is part­lie oppugned by manifeſt violence, and partlie by guilefull ſnares, ſubtillie deuiſed of the enemies. But perhaps, ſome man would aſke the queſtion, where­hence comes ſuch and ſo greate bitter hatred, into the mindes of the vngodlie ones againſt the church, which keepeth and retayneth the heauenlie Do­ctrine?

For neither can it be, but that the Church which ſetteth foorth the true meaning concerning the eſſence and will of God, ſhould therewith alſo reprehende the Confuſion of Opinions and Worſhippinges, which with a malignante countenance, (that is) by all euill ſhew are repugnant to the manifeſted will of God. For God hath called his Church vnto this function, to the ende we ſhoulde builde vp and firmelie plant thoſe thinges that are true, and vtterly deſtroy, and roote out ſuch thinges as are vnto them contrarie. When, therefore, the Deuill, enemie to God and his Church, cannot abide the building vp of his works, he enforceth Tirantes and their Champions to pre­pare and practiſe all the induſtrie of his kingdome, vnto the deſtruction of the true Church, and of the Doctrine which ſhe profeſseth.

The ſecond part without doubting entreateth of the efficacie of the goſpel, and diſcerneth the ſame not onelie from philoſophie, but alſo from the law which commaundeth that which is right, and for­biddeth that which is wronge. For philoſophie can not heale the woundes of the conſcience nor call backe mens ſoules from hell, ſeeing it teacheth no certaine thing touching the will of God, nor our ſaluation. Bee it much leſſe to purpoſe then that the lawe may be a hauen or ſuccoure for our conſcience ſtrugling with ſinne and death, when it wonderfulie encreaſeth our feares and aſtoniſhmentes with her threatning thunderbolts. Therefore the alone prea­ching of the goſpell hath force and efficacie that it may raiſe vp or comforte and confirme our conſci­ences ſo wraſtling, and as it were to call them backe from death to life. The third parte is a prayer agree­ing with doctrine of the goſpell. For as the prea­ching of the goſpell diſcribeth the mercie whereby God receyueth and preſerueth wretched mankinde flying vnto the Mediator: So in fine it craueth for­forgeuenes of ſinnes, and clearly diſcerneth ſinnes of ignorance &amp; negligence not wil­fullie performed, from tranſgreſsi­ons againſt good conſcience.

Moreouer the power of God is plainly ſeene in the greatnes of the heauenly bodies and ſwiftnes of theire mouing. For who is not amaſed at the conſideration of the Sunne, which not without cauſe is of <span class="hi">Plato</span> called <span class="hi">Oculus</span> mundi, the eye of the worlde.

But although I take not ſo much vpō me, as to find fault with their purpoſe: yet I am moued with the weigh­tines of the words to be perſwaded that this pſalme muſt be vnderſtood, concerning Chriſt the eternall King and Prieſte, and of the tragicall puniſhments due to the Iewiſh people. For firſt is an often menti­on made of the eternitie, which agreeth more vnto the kingdome of Chriſt, then vnto tranſitorie ſtates of regiment.

This ground of our purpoſe thus framed, let vs after this ſpeake touching the argument of this Pſalme. No doubt it is that the firſt pare of the pſalme is a plentifull &amp; notable deſcription of glo­rie which Chriſt had in his reſurrection, &amp; triumph, and ſitting at the right hand of God, for euer, ſhall haue. For as in his paſsion he was brought low and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13517"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=123">[Page 238]</a></span> debaſed, worſe then Angels and men: ſo riſing frō death to life &amp; triūphing, he was placed in high dig­nitie of glorie as in the 2. <span class="hi">Philip.</span> it is ſaide. <span class="hi">Therefore hath God exalted him &amp; geuen him a name which is aboue all names. &amp;c.</span> This glorie did the Apoſtles beholde whole 40. dayes together. For there ſaw they, mor­talitie to be fullie &amp; wholie aboliſhed in chriſt: they ſawe a new nature ſhining in the light of heauen, in a new righteouſnes and life. And ſeeing it properlie appertaineth vnto the prieſt to bleſſe, not only the kingdome of Chriſt, but alſo the prieſthoode of this Lord is here deſcribed. Let vs therfore hold ſtill (the definition of the high prieſt in the church) that the difference betwene Chriſt and other prieſtes may be perceaued. The hye prieſt is a perſon immediat­lie ſent from God, to the publiſhing of the goſpell, to pacefie by his ſacrifice the wrath of god, &amp; to pray for vs hauing witnes, that he ſhall be heard, and by which perſon, benefites promiſed in the newe teſta­ment, are beſtowed vpon vs. By this difinition it is cleare, what difference there is betwene the prieſt­hoode of Chriſt and the miniſteries of the teachers in the church. For, he is the fountaine of doctrine, which being pronounced from the boſome of the e­ternal father, he hath made knowne. Other teachers onlie receaue the benefites mencioned, from this maſter. Secondlie he onelie with his ſacrifice and in­terceſsion pacifieth the wrath of his eternall father. But the miſeries or calamities of other miniſters are not ſacrifices for the ſinne of mankind, but eyther puniſhmentes for certaine proper offences, eyther els tryals or exerciſes of faith diſcerning true faith from hipocriſie, eyther els teſtimonies of the doc­trine of immortalitie which they profeſſe, and are ſignes &amp; tokens nothing failing cōcerning the iudg­ments <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13554"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=123">[Page 239]</a></span> that ſhalbe.

This comminatiō or threatning can no man read without great feare of minde, ſpeciallie ſeing the thing ſheweth that the regiment of the Iewes was ſo diſtroyed that it could neuer be reſtored, &amp; that the Iewes were puniſhed with perpetuall baniſhment.

For cauſes impulſiue, formall and ſmall do very greatly dif­fer: which make diuerſities of deedes, without end. In the Jewes was the cauſe impulſiue, burning hatred a­gainſt theire teacher who rebuked theire ſinnes &amp; lewde <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14036"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=18500&amp;page=128">[Page 248]</a></span> <span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>nions. The formall cauſe was as (they had a will euen in his paſſion,) the ſame torments and rending of him, which they would to be eternall. The finall cauſes were that this teacher might ſo be taken away that he ſhould not haue life againe, and to the end this libertie of theire miſchéefe might be confirmed. But the impulſiue cauſe mouing god, is the great mercy towards mankind and the ſame interceſſion of his ſonne, who offered vp himſelfe vnto puniſhment for vs. The formall which god would worke in his paſſion, is not cheefly the tor­ments, but the obedence of his ſonue. The finall cauſes are, that wrath being pacified by this obediēce, he might ſatiſfie the righteouſnes of God, and that the ſame ſonne might haue life againe, and raigne in eternall felowſhip with the father eternall, and might there reſtore lyfe &amp; e­uerlaſting ſaluation vnto his Heritage. It is manifeſt then that the cauſes agrée not in God and in the Jewes alike, although they runne both into one obiecte, like as the ſurgeon &amp; the manqueller incur both one obiecte, and both do ſomwhat ſmyte, but after a contrarie maner &amp; by contrary cauſes. By this reſolution it is cleare, what the Jewes purpoſed in theire mindes, carying Chriſt vnto his cruell death, and that the ſequel of gods proui­dence diſapoynted the vngodly hope of theire Jewiſh enterpriſes. And what ſo is ſpoken concerning the head the ſame alſo is true concerning the bodie.
