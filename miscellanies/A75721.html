And this was all that came upon Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddocks</span> endeavours.</p><p>After ſome farther procedure, made by the Col. They in the <span class="hi">George</span> Inne being reduced to all extremity, they in the Inne deſired a par­ley, and that granted, they deſired Life, Liberty and Eſtate, and to keep their monies. The Col. anſwered, that thoſe conditions were Paramount his power, but that if they would immediately yeeld themſelves priſoners, and come forth in the ſtreet, he would ſo inter­cede to the Protector, that they ſhould not bee injured by any power under Heaven, either in Life, Liberty or Eſtate. Here were the only conditions, and made with thoſe in the <span class="hi">George</span> Inne only, nothing at all relating to Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddock</span> or Mr. <span class="hi">Grove,</span> who were priſo­ners long before.</p><p>Hereupon 5. perſons, <span class="hi">viz.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Wake,</span> two of the Mr. <span class="hi">Colliers,</span> and two others came out of the <span class="hi">George</span> to the Col. and undertooke that 28. men horſe and armes would immediately follow them, and ſo many in the <span class="hi">George</span> ſhould be delivered up; and the Col. appoint­ing ſome of his own men to take an account of the men at the door the 5. perſons only came forth, the reſt came not to the Col. to the door, but took an opportunity, and eſcaped out at the back doores: or hid themſelves in hay mowes or other places.</p><p>The Collonel thus abuſed, and ſo free of all treaty; and yet conceiving and finding thoſe 5. perſons to bee men of worth and valour, would not take any advantage againſt them; but continued his reſolution to intercede to the Protector for them, which hee did as ef­fectually as hee could, and ſaved their Lives and Eſtates, although they were condemned unto death, the Col. uſing his utmoſt en­deavours to have had them ſet at Liberty alſo, but could not prevail, although his Importunities were great and many on their behalf, as is evident and known.</p><p>When Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddock</span> heard of this ſucceſs at the <span class="hi">George</span> Inne, and that the Collonel had promiſed to intercede for the Lives of thoſe 5. Gentlemen: Hee told the Col. that hee ought to be included, becauſe hee had uſed his endeavour to reduce them, although it took no effect. The Col. replied, that there were no Articles given, only a promiſe to intercede for thoſe 5 perſons, and that as for the reſt in the Inne after the ſaid 5 perſons came out, they would not ſtay the reſult, but had made their eſcape, and left the ſaid 5 perſons to mercy.</p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddock</span> inſiſted ſtill, to have had formal Articles made in writing, for his own advantage, after hee was a Priſoner, never pretending to any before, or to any afterwards, but for uſing his endeavour to perſwade the ſaid ſurrender, which took no effect. And yet the Col. uſed all the means hee could to have ſaved his Life alſo as a Gent. of great hopes and fortune. But could never bee drawne by him to betray his truſt, though tempted with 500. <sup>1</sup>. then with a 1000. <sup>1</sup>. then with his whole Eſtate, too mean conſiderations to weigh down truth and honeſty.</p><p>And whereas it hath been by ſome alleaged, that the Collonel ſhould ſay, to ſome of the Priſoners, that if their General <span class="hi">Wagſtaffe</span> had been there, hee ſhould have been uſed as they were, but that now hee was likely to fare worſe. It was ſpoken only to this purpoſe, that had hee been with them, hee ſhould have had air Quarter as a ſouldier, but being eſcaped, hee might bee abuſed, or miſcarry by other hands.</p><p>And whereas alſo it hath been reported, that the Protector ſhould ſay; that had the Col. gave Articles, hee would have allowed them; The Protector never ſaid any ſuch thing to the Col. but on the contrary, wrote under his hand, that hee would not ſpare Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddock</span> upon any conſideration whatſoever, But a ful diſcovery of the whole deſign.</p><p>Theſe things the Col. can make appear, by the intercourſe of Letters betwixt the Protector, Mr. <span class="hi">Penruddock</span> and himſelf, and by ſuf­ficient witneſſes, and Appeals to the Honorable Lords, whether theſe Interloquatory paſſages in <span class="hi">furore belli,</span> and dark night, can in the leaſt amount to Articles, or whether upon theſe ſurmiſes, the Col. ought in the leaſt to bee clouded or blemiſhed; Hee proteſting in the ſight of God, that he never ſigned or ſealed any Articles whatſoever, or ever made any promiſe, than as to thoſe 5. perſons as aforeſaid.</p><p style="text-indent: 5em">A more full and exact account of all that paſſed, hee hopes ſhortly to preſent to the view of the world, for the full cleer­ing of his injured innocence, if hee may bee ſo permitted to do.</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Date: 1654<br /><!--
