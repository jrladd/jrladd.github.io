But notwithſtanding ſo many interruptions and diſturbances, many mighty and great Works have been carried on by us Worms and no Men. You, Sir, have a new Wainſcot Chair, and our Seats, that were but covered with Mats, when we came firſt to ſit here, are now lin'd with good Broad-Cloth of 16 <span class="hi">s.</span> a yard, and the whole Houſe is hang'd in a better manner then any man expected. But this is not all that we have done, for we have reformed Reli­gion, and brought the Church as nigh to what it was in the Primitive times among <span class="hi">Jews</span> and <span class="hi">Pagans,</span> as may be; for the <span class="hi">Chriſtians</span> have ſold all they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e192"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=45187&amp;page=2">[Page 2]</a></span> have long ſince, and laid it at our feet, and we begin once more to have all things in common. Beſide, Sir, we have done ſtrange Juſtice on the late Tyrant, and transform'd the Kingdom into a Commonwealth, as <span class="hi">Nebuchad­nezzar</span> was into a Beaſt. But there is one thing that we have omitted, no leſs neceſſary then any thing that we have done, and which indeed the peo­ple have much more reaſon to expect from us; for Reformation, as well as Charity, ſhould begin at home: To hold forth my meaning in brief to you, Sir, it is the cleanſing of our own <span class="hi">Houſe of Office</span>; and if that name be not mannerly enough for this place, it is in your power to help it: for there is a ſpare name that hath been lately conferr'd on this Honourable Houſe by the people, which was once called the <span class="hi">Houſe of Parliament,</span> as it is now the <span class="hi">Rump.</span> This name, in my opinion, we cannot better diſpoſe of, then in con­ferring it on the Houſe I ſpoke of, that not only that, but all other Houſes of the ſame quality (of which ours is the Repreſentative) may in the right thereof hereafter be call'd a <span class="hi">Rump,</span> as being a name more proper and ſignifi­cant, in regard of the relation it hath to that part. And truly, Sir, I believe, the wiſdom and juſtice of this Houſe can do no leſs, if you pleaſe but to con­ſider the near and intimate correſpondence that Houſe has ever held with this, as having ever been entruſted with the moſt urgent and weighty matters that we ever carried on, and ſo neceſſary, that I may boldly ſay, without that re­courſe which we have had to it in our greateſt extremities, this Houſe might have ſuffered for it many a time and oft. It is now, Sir, as full, as this Honourable Houſe was once of Members, and as unuſeful, until we take ſome courſe to empty it, as we did this, which, I humbly conceive, we can by no means avoid: For, under favour, I do not think we can uſe this Houſe, as we did the <span class="hi">Houſe of Lords</span>; I mean, Vote it down, when it will ſerve our turn no longer; no, this is a matter of a higher nature, and more weighty con­cernment; and as the difference is very great in reaſon of State, ſo is it alſo in point of Conſcience. For though it is true, we engaged and ſwore to maintain the <span class="hi">Houſe of Lords,</span> yet we did it not after a right manner: For we read, it was a cuſtom among the <span class="hi">Jews,</span> when they made any ſolemn Vow, to put their hands under one anothers Hams; and if we had done ſo when we ſwore that, and kiſs'd the Book, I grant, we had been bound in conſcience to have upheld it longer than we did, I mean, longer than we had need of it: but we, quite contrary, held up our hands, and ſo are not bound to keep it otherwiſe than we took it, that is, hand over head; for unleſs we differ'd from the <span class="hi">Jews</span> in other matters more than we do, I know no reaſon why we ſhould in this—But now I ſpeak of the <span class="hi">Jews,</span> give me leave, by obſerving one paſſage in their Hiſtory, to hold forth unto you the danger of ſuppreſſing the aforeſaid Houſe. <span class="hi">Saul,</span> for want of ſuch a convenience, going into a Cave where <span class="hi">David</span> had hid himſelf, had like to have loſt his life; for if <span class="hi">David</span> had been one of us, I know what had become of <span class="hi">Saul,</span> he would rather have cut off his Head than a piece of his Coat, as I wonder he did not, ſince, being a Prophet, he might have made Scripture of purpoſe to have prov'd him a Ty­rant and a Traitor, as we did Law to condemn the late King after he was put to death. But though <span class="hi">David</span> were wiſer than his Teachers, he was not ſo wiſe as we were; 'Tis true, for his own advantage, he knew how to make the ſilly <span class="hi">Philistims</span> believe he was mad; but I am miſtaken if we have not out­done <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e264"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=45187&amp;page=2">[Page 3]</a></span> him that way too, and made the wiſeſt think us ſo. But to return to the purpoſe. Suppoſe, Sir, the Army ſhould have occaſion to give this Ho­nourable Houſe a purge again, you would be loth it ſhould work here; and truly I do not know what other way you have to avoid it, unleſs we ſhould make uſe of that place where the Aſſembly of Divines lately ſate; which for my part, I like very well, if it were nearer; and certainly they have no reaſon to take it ill; for it is according to the example of the beſt Re­formed Churches. And I know no reaſon why we may not as well ſit there, and make ſour faces at our own charges, as they did at the charge of the Commonwealth. For mine own part, (did not the common good provoke me to it) I have as little reaſon to ſpeak as another, and perhaps leſs; for my Breeches are made cloſe at the knees, and ſo better fitted againſt a miſ­chance. Beſide, I know the worſt of it, for I believe you have often heard what I have ſuffer'd in the ſervice of my Country. But let that paſs, though it were the worſe for my Reputation, and my Breeches, it was the better for my Body, and my Soul too, for I have edify'd much by it. 'Tis true, the Boys hold their Noſes, and cry <span class="hi">Fogh,</span> when they ſee me in the Streets; but, What of that? A wiſe man knows how to make an advantage of the greateſt diſaſters, and ſo have I done. For there was a time (Mr. Speaker) when this Honourable Houſe had like to have been a Foul-Houſe; And when was that? Truly it was when the Prentices came hither, to ſhew us one trick more than ever we taught them: Then did I take this worſhipful Chain off my Neck, and very politickly put it in my Codpiece; for I know well enough, that no body in this Town, where I am ſo well known, would venture to look for it there; and I was not miſtaken, for here you ſee I have it ſtill. The ſame thing I did at another time, and that was, when (as you may well remember) a piece of Plaiſter falling from the Roof, ſome of the Members cried, <span class="hi">Treaſon,</span> and many made haſte to get out of the Houſe as faſt as they could; ſo did not I, no, Sir, I reſolved to ſtay by it; and there­fore (having put my Chain in my Codpiece) I crept under the Bench in this very place where I now ſit, and there I lay cloſe, until I heard ſome that were near me ſay, They ſmell'd Gun-powder; but then I knew it was a miſtake, and ſo it prov'd indeed: but if it had been otherwiſe, no danger ſhould have made me forſake my duty. No, Sir, I have been ſo faithful to this Houſe, and ſo conſtant to my Principles, that I have not changed ſo much as my Seat ſince the happy beginning of this Parliament. In this very place did I then ſit; on both ſides of me ſate two Members, that afterwards prov'd Malignants; for they took ſnuff at ſomething that fell from me in my zeal to the Cauſe, and ran to <span class="hi">Oxford</span> to the King; their Eſtates are long ſince ſold, for which the Commonwealth may thank me: For verily, Sir, I have not been altogether an unprofitable Member, according to my Talent, and the diſpenſation of what was in me; for my Bowels have been often pour'd out for the proſperity of this Houſe; and, I hope, my converſation hath held forth ſo much of the inward man, as may be ſufficient to ſatisfie the well affected, by whom I am entruſted. And as for my Back-biters, I forgive them freely; alas, they hurt themſelves, and not me; for if they get any thing by dealing with me that way, they muſt have good luck.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e286"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=45187&amp;page=3">[Page 4]</a></span> <span class="hi">SIR,</span></p><p>I have us'd the more freedom with you, becauſe I have ſome pretence to your pardon; for I believe you have often obſerv'd, that when any thing has fallen from any of my fellow-Members that the Houſe has reſented, it has preſently been laid to my charge, and I have always taken it upon me freely; for I ſhall never refuſe to ſerve this Houſe in any ſenſe whatſoever. I ſhall therefore humbly move, that you would be pleaſed, to order this Honourable Houſe to adjourn for a convenient time, until that Houſe be emptied and made ſweet again; for if we ſhould ſit here before, it will not be in the power of any one man to own ſo much ſtink as will be laid to my charge.</p><div class="trailer">FINIS.</div><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e295"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=45187&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Atkins, Thomas, Sir..
