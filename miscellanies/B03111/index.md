## 1\. ENGLANDS TRIUMPH. OR THE RUMP ROUTED By the true Aſſertor of Englands
Intereſt, Generall George Monck.  
A SONET

To the Tune of, Fill up the Parliament full.

WHat maketh the Souldiers

To ſtand to their Arms?

'Tis for what they proteſt

To keep us from harms,

The Members Secluded

Come now in by Swarms

To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full.

To fill up the Parliament Full.

You know that the City Gates

Late were thrown down,

The Walls too were order'd

By Parliament Frown:

But General Monck, has pleaſ'd

Souldier and Gown,

And fil'd up the Parliament

And fil'd up the Parliament Full.

A diſpute there was had

By the Members Secluded,

Brave Monck was the Umpire

And found them Deluded,

But Englands great joy

Is now wholy Concluded:

For he's fild up the Parliament Full, full, fu [...]

He's fil'd up the Parliament full.

Sir Arthur the Valiant

Muſt make his ſpeech Large,

Leſt the Members Excluded

Lay Treaſon to's Charge,

Hee'd better t'have dealt

With his Newcaſtle Barge,

Than to ſee the Old Parliament Full, full, full

Than to ſee the Old Parliament full.

The Aldermen Grave,

And the Commons o'th City,

Impriſoned were

The more is the Pity,

But Gen'ral Monck ſaid,

That I will acquit yee,

For the Parliament now ſhall be full, full, full

For the Parliament now ſhall be full:

Have you not ſeen

Freſh flowers in the Spring;

And have you not heard

A Cage-Bird to ſing?

But if the Cage-Members

Would bring in the King—

It would fill up the Parliament Full, full, full;

It would fill up the Parliament full.

The Parliament now will

Come into their Geers,

For Secluded PRYN

(That once loſt his Ears)

Marcht in with his Rapier

For Commons and Peers,

To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full,

To fill up the Parliament full.

Whoſe often Declaring

Ha's furniſh't the Nation

With Parliament Arguments

Of the old Faſhion,

And would have both

King, Lords and Peers in this Nation

To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full

To fill up the Parliament full.

Our brave General Monck

We bound are to thank,

The Honeſt Lord Fairfax

Ha's plaid (too) his Prank

No thanks to be given

To the Rump nor the Shank

To fill up the Parliament Full, full, full

To fill up the Parliament full.

Had the City ne'r mov'd,

Nor the Prentices ſtrove,

They'd loſt their Old Charter:

But MONCK had a love

To challenge the Grand Ones

Which Miſchiefs did move;

And ſo fill'd up the Parliament Full, full, full,

And ſo fill'd up the Parliament full.
