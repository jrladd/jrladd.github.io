He is one of <span class="hi">Deu­calion</span>'s By-blows, begotten of a <span class="hi">Stone,</span> and has ta­ken an Oath never to pity <span class="hi">Widow nor Orphan.</span> His firſt buſineſs is to bait you for Money for his (con­founded) <span class="hi">Civility;</span> next, to call for Drink as faſt as men for Buckets of water in a Conflagration: Af­ter which, becoming grave and ſerious, he adviſes you in revenge to <span class="hi">arreſt</span> the Plaintiff, and offers to do it, with or without cauſe; 'tis all one to him, if he perceive you have money. His <span class="hi">Follower</span> is an Hanger that he wears by his ſide; a falſe Die of the ſame Bale, but not the ſame Cut: for it runs ſomewhat higher, inflames the Reckoning, and ſo does more miſchief. He's a Tumbler that drives in the Coneys; but is yet but a Bungler, and knows <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e539"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95646&amp;page=5">[Page 8]</a></span> not how to <span class="hi">cut up</span> a man without tearing, unleſs by a Pattern. This is the Hook that hangs under wa­ter to choak the Fiſh, and his Officer the Quill a­bove, which <span class="hi">pops</span> down as ſoon as ever the Bait is ſwallowed. Though differing in degree, they are both much of a Complexion, onely the Teeth of this <span class="hi">latter</span> are more ſharp, and he more hungry, becauſe he does but ſnap, and hath not his full <span class="hi">half-ſhare of the Booty.</span> A main part of his Office is to ſwear and bluſter at their trembling Priſoners, and cry, <span class="hi">Confound us, why do we wait? let's Shop him:</span> whilſt the other meekly replies, <span class="hi">Jack, be patient; 'tis a civil Gentleman, and I know will conſider us:</span> which Species of Wheedling in Terms of their Art, is called <span class="hi">Sweeten and Pinch.</span> The Eyes of theſe Wolves are as quick in their Head, as a <span class="hi">Cut-purſes</span> in a Throng; and as nimble are they at their Buſineſs, as an <span class="hi">Hang-man</span> at an Exe­cution. They'll court a <span class="hi">broken Pate</span> to heal it with a Plaister of <span class="hi">Green-wax,</span> and ſuck more ſilver out of a Wound than a Surgeon. Yet as theſe Eels are generally bred out of the Mud of a Ban­krupt, ſo they commonly die with their <span class="hi">Guts</span> ript up, or are decently run through the <span class="hi">Lungs;</span> and as they liv'd hated, die unpitied.
