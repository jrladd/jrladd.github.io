This account I have from an intimate Friend of mine, who was an acquaintance of his.</p><p><span class="hi">Anno 1647,</span> the Lord <span class="hi">Mohun</span>'s Son and Heir (a gallant Gentleman, Valiant, and a great Master of Fencing and Horsemanship) had a Quarrel with Prince <span class="hi">Griffin;</span> there was a Challenge, and they were to Fight on Horse-back in <span class="hi">Chelsey-fields</span> in the Morn­ing: Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun</span> went accordingly to meet him; but about <span class="hi">Ebery-Farm</span> he was met by some who quarrell'd with him and Pi­stol'd him; it was believed, by the Order of Prince <span class="hi">Griffin;</span> for he was sure, that Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun</span> being so much the better Horse­man <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> would have Killed him, had they Fought. In <span class="hi">Iames-street</span> in <span class="hi">Covent-Garden</span> did then Lodge a Gentlewoman a Hand­some Woman but Common, who was Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun</span>'s Sweet-heart. Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun</span> was Murthered about Ten a clock in the Morn­ing; and at that very time, his Mistress being in Bed, saw Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun</span> come to her Bed-side, drew the Curtain, looked upon her and went away: She called after him <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5241"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=35">[Page 62]</a></span> but no answer: She knock'd for her Maid, ask'd her for Mr. <span class="hi">Mohun;</span> she said, she did not see him, and had the Key of her Cham­ber door in her Pocket. This Account my Friend aforesaid, had from the Gentlewo­mans own Mouth, and her Maids.</p><p>A parallel Story to this, is, that Mr. <span class="hi">Brown,</span> (Brother-in-law to the Lord <span class="hi">Conningsby</span>) dis­covered his being Murthered to several. His Phantome appear'd to his Sister and her Maid in <span class="hi">Fleet-street</span> about the time he was Killed in <span class="hi">Herefordshire,</span> which was about a Year since, 1693.</p><p>Sir <span class="hi">Walter Long</span> of <span class="hi">Draycot</span> (Grandfather of Sir <span class="hi">Iames Long</span>) had two Wives; the first a Daughter of Sir—<span class="hi">Packinton</span> in <span class="hi">Worcestershire;</span> by whom he had a Son: His second Wife was a Daugter of Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Thinne</span> of <span class="hi">Longleat;</span> by whom he had seve­ral Sons and Daughters. The second Wife did use much Artifice to render the Son by the first Wife (who had not much Prome­thean Fire) Odious to his Father; she would get her Acquaintance to make him Drunk; and then expose him in that Con­dition to his Father; in fine she never left off her attempts, till she had got Sir <span class="hi">Walter</span> to disinherit him. She laid the Scene for the doing this, at <span class="hi">Bath</span> at the Assizes, where was her Brother Sir <span class="hi">Egrimond Thinne</span> an E­minent Serjeant at Law, who drew the Writing; and his Clerk was to sit up all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5308"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=35">[Page 63]</a></span> Night to Engross it; as he was Writing, he perceived a shadow on the Parchment, from the Candle; he look'd up, and there ap­pear'd a Hand, which immediately va­nish'd; he was startled at it, but thought it might be only his Fancy, being sleepy; so he Writ on; by and by a fine White-hand interposed between the Writing and the Can­dle (he could discern it was a Womans Hand) but vanish'd as before; I have forgot it appeared a Third time. But with that, the Clerk threw down his Pen, and would Engross no more, but goes and tells his Master of it, and absolutely refused to do it. But it was done by some body, and Sir <span class="hi">Wal­ter Long</span> was prevailed with to Seal and Sign it. He lived not long after; and his Body did not go quiet to the Grave, it being Arrested at the Church-porch by the Tru­stees of the first Lady. The Heir's Relati­ons took his part, and Commenc'd a Suit against Sir <span class="hi">Walter</span> (the second Son) and compell'd him to accept of a Moiety of the Estate; so the Eldest Son kept <span class="hi">South-Wran­chester,</span> and Sir <span class="hi">Walter</span> the second Son <span class="hi">Dracot Cernes, &amp;c.</span> This was about the middle of the Reign of King <span class="hi">Iames</span> the First.</p><p>I must not forget an Apparition in my Country, which appear'd several times to Doctor <span class="hi">Turbervile</span>'s Sister, at <span class="hi">Salisbury;</span> which is much talk'd of. One Marry'd a second Wife, and contrary to the Agree­ment <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5354"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=36">[Page 64]</a></span> and Settlement at the first Wife's Marriage, did wrong the Children by the first Venter. The Settlement was hid be­hind a Wainscot in the Chamber where the Doctor's Sister did lie: And the Appari­tion of the first Wife did discover it to her. By which means Right was done to the first Wife's Children. The Apparition told her that she Wandred in the Air, and was now going to God. Dr. <span class="hi">Turbervile</span> (Ocu­list) did affirm this to be true.

Said the Knight, I am Dead, but cannot rest in peace for the Wickedness and Abo­mination of my Son <span class="hi">George</span> at Court. I do appear to you, to tell him of it, and to ad­vise and dehort him from his Evil ways. Said Mr. <span class="hi">Tows,</span> the Duke will not believe me, but will say, that I am Mad, or Doat. Said Sir <span class="hi">George,</span> Go to him from me, and tell him by such a Token [some Mole] that he had in some secret place, which none but himself knew of. Accordingly Mr. <span class="hi">Towes</span> went to the Duke, who Laugh'd at his Mes­sage. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5410"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=36">[Page 65]</a></span> At his return home, the Phantome ap­peared again; and told him, that the Duke would be Stab'd (he drew out a Dagger) a quarter of a Year after: And you shall out­live him half a Year; and the Warning that you shall have of your Death will be, That your Nose will fall a bleeding: All which accordingly fell out so. This Account I have had (in the main) from two, or three; but Sir <span class="hi">William Dugdale</span> affirms what I have here taken from him to be true, and that the Apparition told him of several things to come, which proved true, <span class="hi">e. g.</span> of a Pri­soner in the <span class="hi">Tower,</span> that should be honoura­bly delivered. This Mr. <span class="hi">Towes</span> had so of­ten the Ghost of his old Friend appear to him, that it was not at all terrible to him. He was Surveyor of the Works at <span class="hi">Windsor</span> (by the favour of the Duke:) Being then sitting in the Hall, he cried out, The Duke of <span class="hi">Buckingham</span> is stabb'd: He was stabb'd that very moment.</p><p>This Relation Sir <span class="hi">William Dugdale</span> had from Mr. <span class="hi">Pine,</span> (Neighbour to Mr. <span class="hi">Towes</span> without <span class="hi">Bishop-gate</span>) they were both great lovers of Musick, and sworn Brothers.

He had every Night a great Coal-fire in his Chamber, which gave a light as clear almost as a Candle. (He was Hypocondrical.)

The poor Man told him. Said the Stranger I can Cure you. Take two or Three Balm-leaves steep'd in your Beer for a Fortnight, or three Weeks, and you will be restor'd to your Health: But Constantly and Zealously serve God.

Furze,</span> to his Servant <span class="hi">Francis Fry,</span> being of the age of 21 next <span class="hi">August,</span> an aged Gentleman with a Pole in his Hand, and like that he was wont to carry about with him when living, to kill Moles withall, who told the Young Man he should not be afraid of him; but should tell his Master, <span class="hi">i. e.</span> his Son, That several Legacies that he had be­queathed were unpaid, naming 10 <span class="hi">s.</span> to one, 10 <span class="hi">s.</span> to another, <span class="hi">&amp;c. Fry</span> replied, that the par­ty he last nam'd was Dead. The Spectrum replied, he knew that, but said it must be paid to—and named the next Relation, These things being perform'd, he promised he would trouble him no further. These small Legacies were paid accordingly. But the young Man having caried 20 <span class="hi">s.</span> order'd by the Spectrum to his Sister Mrs. <span class="hi">Furze</span> of the Parish of <span class="hi">Staverton</span> near <span class="hi">Totness,</span> which Money the Gentlewoman refus'd to receive, being sent her, as she said, from the Devil. The same Night <span class="hi">Fry</span> lodging there, the Spectrum appear'd to him again, whereup­on <span class="hi">Fry</span> challenged his promise not to trou­ble him, and said he had done all he desir'd him, but that Mrs. <span class="hi">Furze</span> would not re­ceive the Money. The Spectrum replied, that's true indeed. But bid him ride to <span class="hi">Tot­ness</span> and buy a Ring of that value, and that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8708"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=64">[Page 115]</a></span> she would take: Which was provided for her; and receiv'd by her. Then <span class="hi">Fry</span> rode home­wards attended by a Servant of Mrs. <span class="hi">Furze.</span> But being come into <span class="hi">Spreyton</span> Parish, or ra­ther a little before, he seem'd to carry an old Gentlewoman behind him, that often threw him off his Horse, and hurried him with such violence, as astonish'd all that saw him, or heard how horridly the Ground was beaten; and being come into his Ma­ster's Yard, <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s Horse (a mean Beast) sprung at once 25 Foot. The trouble from the Man-Spectre ceased from this time. But the old Gentlewoman Mrs. <span class="hi">Furze,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Furze</span>'s second Wife, whom the Spectre at his first appearance to <span class="hi">Fry,</span> called, That Wicked Woman my Wife, (though I knew her, and took her for a very good Woman) presently after appears to several in the House, <span class="hi">viz.</span> to <span class="hi">Fry,</span> Mrs. <span class="hi">Thomasin Gidley, Anne Langdon</span> born in my Parish, and to a little Child which was forced to be remov'd from the House; sometimes in her own shape, sometimes in shapes more horrid, as of a Dog belching Fire, and of an Horse, and seeming to ride out at the Window, carrying only one pane of Glass away, and a little piece of Iron. After this <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s Head was thrust into a narrow space, where a Man's Fist could not enter, between a Bed and a Wall; and forced to be taken thence by the strength of Men, all bruised and bloody; <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8751"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=65">[Page 116]</a></span> upon this, it was thought fit to Bleed him; and after that was done, the Binder was re­mov'd from his Arm, and convey'd about his Middle, and presently was drawn so very straight, it had almost killed him, and was cut asunder making an ugly uncouth noise. Several other times with Handkerchiefs, Cra­vats and other things he was near strangled, they were drawn so close upon his Throat. He lay one Night in his Periwig (in his Ma­ster's Chamber, for the more safety) which was torn all to pieces. His best Periwig he inclosed in a little Box on the inside with a Joind-stool, and other weight upon it; the Box was snapp'd asunder, and the Wig torn all to flitters. His Master saw his Buckles fall all to pieces on his Feet: But, first I should have told you the fate of his Shoe-strings, one of which a Gentlewoman greater than all exception, assured me that she saw it come out of his Shoe, without any visible Hand, and fling it self to the farther end of the Room; the other was coming out too, but that a Maid prevented and help'd it out, which crisp'd and curl'd about her Hand like a living Eel. The Cloaths worn by <span class="hi">Anne Langdon</span> and <span class="hi">Fry</span> (if their own) were torn to pieces on their backs. The same Gentle­woman, being the Daughter of the Mini­ster of the Parish, Mr. <span class="hi">Roger Specott,</span> shewed me one of <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s Gloves, which was torn in his Pocket while she was by. I did view it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8777"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=65">[Page 117]</a></span> near and narrowly, and do seriously confess that it is torn so very accurately in all the Seams and in other places, and laid abroad so artificially, and it is so dexterously tatter'd (and all done in the Pocket in a Minutes time) as nothing Human could have done it; no Cutler could have made an Engine to do it so. Other fantastical Freeks have been very frequent, as, the marching of a great Bar­rel full of Salt out of one Room into another; an Andiron-laying it self over a Pan of Milk that was scalding on the Fire, and two Flitches of Bacon descending from the Chim­ney where they hung, and laid themselves over that Andiron. The appearing of the the Spectrum (when in her own shape) in the same Cloaths, to seeming, which Mrs. <span class="hi">Furze</span> her Daughter-in-law has on. The intangling of <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s Face and Legs, about his Neck, and about the Frame of the Chairs, so as they have been with great difficulty disengaged.</p><p>But the most Remarkable of all happen'd in that Day that I passed by the Door in my return hither, which was <span class="hi">Easter</span>-eve, when <span class="hi">Fry</span> returning from Work (that little he can do) he was caught by the Woman Spectre by the Skirts of his Doublet, and car­ried into the Air; he was quickly mist by his Master and the Workmen, and great enquiry was made for <span class="hi">Fran. Fry,</span> but no hearing of him; but about half an Hour af­ter <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8806"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=66">[Page 118]</a></span> <span class="hi">Fry</span> was heard Whistling and Singing in a kind of a Quagmire. He was now affe­cted as he was wont to be in his Fits, so that none regarded what he said; but coming to himself an Hour after, he solemnly pro­tested, That the Daemon carried him so high that he saw his Master's House under­neath him no bigger than an Hay-cock, that he was in perfect sense and prayed God not to suffer the Devil to destroy him; that he was suddenly set down in that Quagmire. The Workmen found one Shoe on one side of the House, and the other Shoe on the o­ther side; his Periwig was espied next Morn­ing hanging on the Top of a tall Tree. It was soon observ'd, that <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s part of his Body that had laid in the Mud, was much benum'd, and therefore the next <span class="hi">Saturday,</span> which was the Eve of <span class="hi">Low-Sunday,</span> they car­ried him to <span class="hi">Crediton</span> to be let Blood; which being done, and the Company having left him for a little while, returning they found him in a Fit, with his Fore-head all bruis­ed and swoln to a great bigness, none being able to guess how it came, till he recover'd himself, and then he told them, That a Bird flew in at the Window with a great force, and with a Stone in it's Mouth flew directly against his Fore-head. The People looked for it, and found on the Ground just under where he sat, not a Stone, but a weight of Brass, or Copper, which <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8839"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=66">[Page 119]</a></span> the People were breaking, and parting it among themselves. He was so very ill, that he could not ride but one Mile or little more that Night, since which time I have not heard of him, save that he was ill handled the next Day, being <span class="hi">Sunday.</span> Indeed Sir you may wonder that I have not Visited that House, and the poor afflicted People; espe­cially, since I was so near, and passed by the very Door: But besides that, they have called to their assistance none but Noncon­forming Ministers, I was not qualified to be welcome there, having given Mr. <span class="hi">Furze</span> a great deal of trouble the last Year about a Conventicle in his House, where one of this Parish was the Preacher. But I am very well assured of the truth of what I have written, and (as more appears) you shall hear from me again.</p><p>I had forgot to tell you that <span class="hi">Fry</span>'s Mother came to me, grievously bewailing the mise­rable condition of her Son. She told me, that the Day before he had five Pins thrust into his Side. She ask'd, and I gave her the best Advice I could. Particularly, that her Son should declare all that the Spectre, especi­ally the Woman gave him in Charge, for I suspect, there is <span class="hi">aliquid latens;</span> and that she should remove him thence by all means. But I fear that she will not do it.

Near 40 Years ago <span class="hi">Macklend</span> and his Lady, Sister to my Lord <span class="hi">Seaforth,</span> were Walking about their own House, and in their return, both came into the Nurses Chamber, where their young Child was on the Breast: At their coming into the Room, the Nurse falls a Weeping; they asked the cause, dreading the Child was Sick, or that she was scarce of Milk: The Nurse replied, the Child was well, and she had abundance of Milk; yet she still Wept; and being pressed to tell what ailed her; she at last said, <span class="hi">Macklend</span> would dye, and the Lady would shortly be Marryed to another Man. Being enquired how she knew that Event, she told them plainly, that as they came both into the Room, she saw, a Man with a scarlet Cloak and a white Hat, betwixt them, giving the Lady a Kiss over the Shoulder; and this was the cause of her Weeping. All which came to pass after <span class="hi">Macklend</span>'s Death: the Tutor of <span class="hi">Lovat</span> Marry'd the Lady in the same Habit the Woman saw him. Now by this instance, judge if it be Prosperous to one, it is as Dis­mal to another.</p><p><span class="hi"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10456"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=84">[Page 154]</a></span>Query. 4.</span></p><p>If these Events, which Second-sighted Men discover, or fore-tell, be visibly represented to them, and acted, as it were, before their Eyes?</p><p><span class="hi">Answer.</span></p><p>Affirmatively, they see those things vi­sibly; but none sees but themselves; for in­stance, if a Man's Fatal-end be Hanging; they'll see a Gibbet, or a Rope about his Neck: if Beheaded, they'll see the Man without a Head; if Drowned, they'll see Water up to his Throat; if unexpected Death, they'll see a Winding-sheet about his Head: All which are represented to their View.

The Boards lying at the Door of his House, there comes an old Fisher-woman, yet alive, and asked him, Whose were those Boards? He told her they were his own; she asked again, For what use he had them?

He reports, That there they told him many Instances of this Knowledge, which he had forgotten, except two. The first, one of his Sisters, a young Gentlewoman, staying with a Friend at some 30 Miles distance from her Father's House, and the ordinary place of her Re­sidence; One who had the Second-sight in the Family where she was, saw a young Man attending her as she went up and down the House, and this was about Three Months before her Marriage. The second is of a Woman in that Country who is re­puted to have the Second-sight, and decla­red, that Eight Days before the Death of a Gentleman there, she saw a Bier or Coffin covered with a Cloth which she knew, car­ried as it were to the place of Burial, and attended with a great Company, one of which told her it was the Corps of such a Person, naming that Gentleman, who died Eight Days after.

A common Fellow about the House meeting her one Day in the Fields, asked her, saying, Mrs. <span class="hi">Kate,</span> What is that that troubles you and makes you look so ill? She replied, that the cause is known to ma­ny, for my Friends would have me Marry such a Man by name, but I cannot fancy him. Nay, (says the Fellow) give over these Niceties, for he will be your first Hus­band, and will not Live long, and be sure he will leave you a rich Dowry, which will procure you a great Match, for I see a Lord upon each Shoulder of you: All which came to pass in every Circumstance; as Eye and Ear Witnesses declare.</p><p>A Third Instance, of a Traveller coming in to a certain House, desired some Meat: The Mistress being something nice and backward to give him Victuals; you need not, says he, churle me in a piece of Meat; for before an Hour and an half be over, a young Man of such a stature and garb will come in with a great Salmon-fish on his Back, which I behold yonder on the Floor: And it came to pass within the said time.</p><p>A Fourth Instance, of a young Woman in a certain House about Supper time, re­fused to take Meat from the Steward who was offering in the very time Meat to her; being asked why she would not take it? replied, she saw him full of Blood, and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10673"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=88">[Page 163]</a></span> therefore was afraid to take any thing of his Hands.

But about 5 or 6 Years after the Man died, and being brought to his Burial-place, there arose a Debate anent his Grave, and it came to such a height, that they drew Arms and bended their Bows, and one letting off an Arrow, shot through the dead Body upon the Bier-trees, and so no Blood could issue out at a dead Man's Wound. Thus his Sight could not inform him whether the Arrow should be shot in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10684"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=89">[Page 164]</a></span> him Alive or Dead, neither could he con­descend whether near or afar off.</p></div><div class="query" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.2_div.1_div.3"><h5><span class="headingNumber">2.2.1.3. </span><span class="head">Query. 3.</span></h5><p>They foresee Murthers, Drownings, Weddings, Burials, Combates, Manslaught­ers, of all which many Instances might be given.

I shall only insert some few attested by several of good Credit yet alive.</p><p>And First, <span class="hi">Andrew Mackpherson</span> of <span class="hi">Clunie</span> in <span class="hi">Badenoch,</span> being in sute of the Laird of <span class="hi">Gareloch</span>'s Daughter, as he was upon a day going to <span class="hi">Gareloch,</span> the Lady <span class="hi">Gareloch</span> was going somewhere from her House within kenning to the Road which <span class="hi">Clunie</span> was coming; the Lady perceiving him, said to her Attendants, that yonder was <span class="hi">Clunie,</span> going to see his Mistress: One that had this Second-sight in her company replied and said, if yon be he, unless he Marry within six Months, he'll never Mary. The Lady asked, how did he know that? He said, very well; for I see him, saith he, all inclosed in his Winding-sheet, except his Nostrils and his Mouth, which will also close up within Six Months; which <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10788"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=91">[Page 168]</a></span> happened even as he foretold; within the said space he died, and his Brother <span class="hi">Duncan Mackpherson</span> this present <span class="hi">Clunie</span> succeeded. This and the like may satisfie your fourth Query, he seeing the Man even then co­vered all over with his dead Linens. The Event was visibly represented and as it were acted (before his Eyes) and also the last part of your second Query, <span class="hi">viz.</span> That it was as yet to come. As for the rest of the Questions, <span class="hi">viz.</span> That they discover pre­sent and past Events, is also manifest, thus: I have heard of a Gentleman whose Son had gon abroad, and being anxious to know how he was, he went to Consult one who had this Faculty, who told him, that that same Day 5 a Clock in the Afternoon his Son had Married a Woman in <span class="hi">France,</span> with whom he had got so many Thousand Crowns, and within two Years he should come home to see Father and Friends, leav­ing his Wife with Child of a Daughter, and a Son of six Months Age behind him: Which accordingly was true. About the same time two Years he came home, and verified all that was fore-told.</p><p>It is likewise ordinary with Persons that lose any thing, to go to some of these Men, by whom they are directed; how, what Persons, and in what place they shall find it. But all such as profess that Skill, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10814"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=91">[Page 169]</a></span> are not equally dexterous in it. For In­stance, two of them were in Mr. <span class="hi">Hector Mackenzi</span> Minister of <span class="hi">Inverness</span> his Father's House; the one a Gentleman, the other a common Fellow; and Discoursing by the Fire-side, the Fellow suddenly begins to Weep, and cry out Alas! alas! such a Wo­man is either Dead or presently expiring. The Gentlewoman lived 5 or 6 Miles from the House, and had been some Days before in a Fever. The Gentleman being some­what better expert in that Faculty, said, No, saith he, she's not Dead; nor will she dye of this Disease. O saith the Fellow, do you not see her all covered with her Winding-sheet? Ay, saith the Gentleman, I see her as well as you do; but do you not see her Linnen all wet? which is her Sweat, she being presently, cooling of the Fever. This Story Mr. <span class="hi">Hector</span> himself will testifie. The most Remarkable of this sort, that I hear of now, is one <span class="hi">Archibald Mackeanyers,</span> alias <span class="hi">Mackdonald,</span> Living in <span class="hi">Ardinmurch</span> within 10 or 20 Miles, or thereby, of <span class="hi">Glen­coe,</span> and I was present my self, where he fore-told something, which accordingly fell-out. In 1683. this Man being in <span class="hi">Strathspey</span> in <span class="hi">Iohn Mackdonald</span> of <span class="hi">Glencoe</span> his Company, told, in <span class="hi">Balachastell</span> before the Laird of <span class="hi">Grant,</span> his Lady, and several o­thers, and also in my Father's House; that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10865"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=92">[Page 170]</a></span> <span class="hi">Argyle,</span> of whom few or none knew then where he was, at least there was no word of him then here; should within two Twelve Months thereafter, come to the <span class="hi">West-High-lands,</span> and raise a Rebellious Faction, which would be divided among themselves, and disperse, and he unfortunately be taken and Beheaded at <span class="hi">Edinburgh,</span> and his Head set up­on the <span class="hi">Talbooth,</span> where his Father's Head was before him: Which proved as true, as he fore-told it, in 1685. thereafter. Like­wise in the beginning of <span class="hi">May</span> next after the late Revolution, as my Lord <span class="hi">Dundee</span> re­turn'd up <span class="hi">Spey-side</span> after he had followed Ge­neral Major <span class="hi">Mac Kay</span> in his Reer down the length of <span class="hi">Edinglassie,</span> at the <span class="hi">Milatown</span> of <span class="hi">Gar­tinbeg</span> the <span class="hi">Machleans</span> joined him, and after he had received them, he Marched forward, but they remained behind, and fell a Plun­dering: Upon which, <span class="hi">Glencoe</span> and some o­thers, among whom was this <span class="hi">Archibald,</span> being in my Father's House and hearing that <span class="hi">Mac Leans</span> and others were Pillaging some of his Lands, went to restrain them, and com­manded them to March after the Army; after he had cleared the first Town, next my Father's House of them, and was come to the second, there standing on a Hill, this <span class="hi">Archibald</span> said, <span class="hi">Glencoe,</span> If you take my Advice, then make off with your self with all possible haste, for ere an Hour <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10938"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=92">[Page 171]</a></span> come and go, you'll be put to it as hard as ever you was: Some of the Com­pany began to droll and say, what shall be­come of me? Whether <span class="hi">Glencoe</span> believed him, or no, I cannot tell; but this I am sure of, that whereas before he was of intention to return to my Father's House and stay all Night, now we took leave and immedi­ately parted: And indeed, within an Hour thereafter <span class="hi">Mac Kay,</span> and his whole Forces appeared at <span class="hi">Culnakyle</span> in <span class="hi">Abernethie</span> 2 Miles below the place where we parted, and hear­ing that <span class="hi">Cleaverhouse</span> had Marched up the Water-side a little before, but that <span class="hi">Mac Leans</span> and several other stranglers had stayed behind, commanded Major <span class="hi">Aeneas Mac Kay,</span> with 2 Troops of Horse after them; who finding the said <span class="hi">Mac Leans</span> at <span class="hi">Kinchardie</span> in the Parish of <span class="hi">Duthel,</span> Chased them up the <span class="hi">Morskaith:</span> In which Chase <span class="hi">Glencoe</span> hap­pened to be, and was hard put to it, as was fore-told. What became of <span class="hi">Archibald</span> him­self, I am not sure, I have not seen him since, nor can I get a true Account of him, only I know he is yet alive, and at that time one of my Father's Men whom the Red-coats meeting, compell'd to guide them, within sight of the <span class="hi">Mac Leans,</span> found the said <span class="hi">Archibald</span>'s Horse within a Mile of the place where I left him. I am also inform'd, this <span class="hi">Archibald</span> said to <span class="hi">Glencoe,</span> that he would <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11007"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=93">[Page 172]</a></span> be Murthered in the Night-time in his own House Three Months before it happen'd.</p><p>Touching your 3d. Query, The Objects of this Knowledge, are not only sad and dismal; but also joyful and prosperous: Thus, they fore-tell of happy Marriages, good Children, what kind of Life Men shall Live, and in what Condition they shall Die: Also Riches, Honour, Preferment, Peace, Plenty and good Weather.</p><p>Query. 6. What way they pretend to have it? I am informed, that in the Isle of <span class="hi">Sky,</span> especially before the Gospel came thither; several Families had it by Succes­sion, descending from Parents to Children, and as yet there be many there that have it that way; and the only way to be freed from it is; when a Woman hath it her self and is Married to a Man that hath it also; if in the very Act of Delivery, upon the first sight of the Childs Head, it be Bap­tized, the same is free from it; if not he hath it all his Life: By which it seems, it is a thing troublesome and uneasie to them that have it, and such as they would fain be rid of. And may satisfie your 5th Query. And for your farther contentment in this Query; I heard of my Father, that there was one <span class="hi">Iohn du beg Mac Grigor</span> a <span class="hi">Reanach</span>-man Born, very expert in this Knowledge, and my Father coming one Day from <span class="hi">Inverness,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11030"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=93">[Page 173]</a></span> said by the way, that he would go into an Alehouse on the Road, which then would be about 5 Miles off. This <span class="hi">Iohn Mac Grigor</span> being in his Company, and taking up a Slate­stone at his Foot, and looking to it, re­plied; Nay, saith he, you will not go in there, for there is but a matter of a Gal­lon of Ale in it even now, and ere we come to it, it will be all near Drunken, and those who are Drinking there, are Strangers to us, and ere we be hardly past the House, they'll discord among them­selves: Which fell out so; ere we were two pair of Butts past the House, those that were Drinking there went by the Ears, wounded and mischieved one an­other. My Father by this and several o­ther things of this nature, turned curious of this Faculty, and being very intimate with the Man, told him he would fain learn it: To which he answered, that indeed he could in 3 Days time Teach him if he pleased; but yet he would not advise him nor any Man to learn it; for had he once learned he would never be a Minute in his Life, but he would see innumerable Men and Women Night and Day round about him; which perhaps he would think wearisome and unpleasant, for which rea­son my Father would not have it. But as Skilful as this Man was, yet he knew not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11050"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=94">[Page 174]</a></span> what should be his own last End; which was Hanging: And I am Informed, that most, if not all of them, though they can fore-see what shall happen to others; yet they cannot fore-tell, much less prevent what shall besal themselves. I am also in­formed by one who came last Summer from the Isle of <span class="hi">Sky,</span> that any Person that pleases will get it Taught him for a Pound or two of Tobacco.</p><p>As for your last Query. For my own part, I can hardly believe they can be justly presumed, much less truly Godly. As for this <span class="hi">Mac Grigor</span> several report, that he was a very civil discreet Man, and some say he was of good Deportment, and also unjustly Hanged. But <span class="hi">Archibald Mackenyere</span> will not deny himself, but once he was one of the most Notorious Thieves in all the <span class="hi">Highlands:</span> But I am informed since I came to this Knowledge which was by an Acci­dent too long here to relate, that he is turned honester than before.</p><p>There was one <span class="hi">Iames Mack Coil-vic-alaster</span> alias <span class="hi">Grant,</span> in <span class="hi">Glenbeum</span> near <span class="hi">Kirk-Michael</span> in <span class="hi">Strathawin,</span> who had this Sight, who I hear of several that were well acquainted with, was a very honest Man, and of right blameless Conversation. He used ordinari­ly by looking to the Fire, to fore-tell what Strangers would come to his House the next <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11091"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=94">[Page 175]</a></span> Day, or shortly thereafter, by their Habit and Arms, and sometimes also by their Names; and if any of his Goods or Cattel were missing, he would direct his Ser­vants to the very place where to find them whether in a Mire or upon dry Ground; he would also tell, if the Beast were already Dead, or if it would Die ere they could come to it; and in Winter if they were thick about the Fire-side, he would desire them to make room to some others that stood by, tho they did not see them, else some of them would be quickly thrown in­to the midst of it. But whether this Man saw any more than <span class="hi">Brownie</span> and <span class="hi">Meig Mal­lach,</span> I am not very sure: Some say, he saw more continually, and would often be very angry-like, and something troubled, no­thing visibly moving him: Others affirm he saw these two continually, and some­times many more.</p><p>They generally term this Second-sight in <span class="hi">Irish Tashitaraughk,</span> and such as have it <span class="hi">Taishatrin,</span> from <span class="hi">Taish,</span> which is properly a shadowy substance, or such naughty, and thing, as can only, or rather scarcely be discerned by the Eye; but not caught by the hands: for which they as­signed it to <span class="hi">Bugles</span> or Ghosts, so that <span class="hi">Taish­tar,</span> is as much as one that converses with Ghosts or Spirits, or as they commonly <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11132"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=54241&amp;page=95">[Page 176]</a></span> call them, the <span class="hi">Fairies,</span> or <span class="hi">Fairy-Folks.</span> Others call these Men <span class="hi">Phissichin,</span> from <span class="hi">Phis,</span> which is properly Fore-sight, or Fore-knowledge. This is the surest and clearest account of Second-sighted Men that I can now find, and I have set it down fully, as if I were transiently telling it, in your own presence, being curious for nothing but the verity, so far as I could. What you find improper or superfluous, you can best compendise it, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span></p><p>Thus far this Letter, written in a Fami­liar and Homely stile, which I have here set down at length: <span class="hi">Meg Mullack,</span> and <span class="hi">Brownie</span> mentioned in the end of it, are two Ghosts, which (as is constantly re­ported) of old haunted a Family in <span class="hi">Straths-pey</span> of the Name of <span class="hi">Grant.</span> They appeared, the first in the likeness of a young Lass: The Second of a young Lad.</p><p>Dr. <span class="hi">Moulin</span> (who presents his service to you) hath no aquaintance in <span class="hi">Orkney;</span> but I have just now spoken with one who not only hath acquaintance in that Country, but also entertains some thoughts of going thither himself, to get me an account of the Cures usually practised there.
