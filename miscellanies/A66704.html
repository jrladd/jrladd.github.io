Clap but a good Sucker into his Belly, and he makes an excellent Pariſh Pump: and if you add but a Pipe to his Muzle, he may paſs for a Water En­gine, and do good ſervice in time of Fire; you need not fear Drawing him dry, ſo long as all the Ale-houſes, and Taverns in Town, like little Rivulets, ſupply the decreaſe; He contains about as much as thoſe in Churches; but is ſo uncooth a Trough, he's twice as hard to be Gauged: yet by frequent experience, he can gueſs his Meaſure to a Pint, ſpecially if you ex­cept <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e201"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43177&amp;page=3">[Page 4]</a></span> Leakage: His Veins are ſo thronged, and his Blood ſo tainted with Scurvey, Gout, and Dropſie, (and a ſmatch of the <span class="hi">French-man</span> to boot, which he got when he was Drunk, and does not know who to lay it too.) That he defies the intruſion of any other Diſtemper: wherefore he Stalks in as much State through a Peſti­lence; as a well Arm'd Souldier through a ſhower of Bul­lets, for his forementioned Diſeaſes have taken ſuch large Poſſeſſion of his Body, that there's no room left for Infection.</p><p>He has drunk himſelf into a Jelly, and is ſo moiſt, that if you ſqueeſe him, he drops like an Orange.</p><p>His Body a perfect Still, which he Fuells with Bran­dy, inſtead of Char-coal; being throughly heated, you may diſcern the ſweaty Diſtilation tricle from his face, as from the Lid of a Limbick, and if any chance to drop on his Noſe, you may hear it hiz as if it fell u­pon heated Bricks.
