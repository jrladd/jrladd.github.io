The paltering Poet Cherillus dedicated his duncing Poems to that mightie Monarch Alexander, saying that he knew assuredly if A­lexander would not accept them in that they were not pi­thie, yet he would not vtterly reiect them, in that they had a shew of Poetrie. Caesar oft times praised his souldiers for their will, although they wanted skill: and Cicero as well commended stammering Lentulus for his painfull in­dustrie, as learned Laelius for his passing eloquence. Which considered (although wisdome did will mee not to straine further then my sleeue would stretch) I thought good to presēt this imperfect Pamphlet to your honors protectiō, hoping your Lordship will deigne to accept the matter in that it seemeth to be prose, though some thing vnsauory for want of skill, and take my wel meaning for an excuse of my boldnesse, in that my poore wil is not in the wane, whatsoeuer this imperfect worke doo want.

All that courted to Atlanta were hunters, and none sued to Sapho but Poets. Wheresoeuer Maecanas lodgeth, thether no doubt will schollers flocke. And your honour being a worthie fauourer and fosterer of learning, hath forced many through your exquisite vertue, to offer the first fruits of their studie at the shrine of your Lord­ships curtesie. But though they haue waded farre &amp; found mines, and I gadded abroad to get nothing but Mites, yet this I assure my selfe, that they neuer presented vnto your Honour their treasure with a more willing minde, then I doo this simple trash, which I hope your Lordship will so accept.

But this griefe so galled his conscience, and this cursed care so combred his mind, that his happinesse was greatly surcharged with heauinesse, to sée the cause of his care could by no meanes be cured. For this <span class="hi">Clerophon­tes</span> was indued with two children, the one a Daughter named <span class="hi">Lewsippa,</span> and the other a sonne called <span class="hi">Gwydo­nius,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e409"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> this <span class="hi">Lewcippa</span> was so perfect in the complection of her bodie, and so pure in the constitution of her minde, so adorned with outwarde beautie, and endued with in­ward bountie, so pollished with rare vertues and exqui­site qualities, as she séemed a séemely <span class="hi">Venus</span> for her beu­tie, and a second <span class="hi">Vesta</span> for her virginitie; yea, Nature and the Gods had so bountifullye bestowed their giftes vpon her, as Fame her selfe was doubtfull whether shée should make greater report of her excellent vertue, or ex­quisite beautie. But his sonne <span class="hi">Guydonius</span> was so con­trarie to his sister <span class="hi">Lewsippa,</span> (though not in the state of his bodie, yet in the stay of his minde) as it made all men meruaile how two such contrarie stems could spring out of the selfe same stocke: His personage indéede was so comely, his feature so well framed, each lim so perfectlye couched, his face so faire, and his countenance so amiable, as he séemed a heauenly creature in a mortall carcasse. But his minde was so blemished with detestable qualy­ties, and so spotted with the staine of voluptuousnesse, that he was not so much to be commended for the propor­tion of his bodie, as to bée condempned for the imperfec­tion of his minde. He was so endued with vanitie, and so imbrued w<sup>t</sup> vice, so nursed vp in wantonnesse, &amp; so nus­led vp in wilfulnesse, so carelesse to obserue his Fathers commaund, and so retchlesse to regard his counsell, that neither the dreade of Gods wrath, nor the feare of his fa­thers displeasure, could driue him to desist from his de­testable kinde of liuing. Nay, there was no fact so filthy, which he would not commit, no mischiefe so monstrous, which he wold not enterprise: no daunger so desperate, which he would not aduenture: no perill so fearefull, which he would not performe: nor no action so diuellish, which he would not execute.

Why <span class="hi">Clerophontes,</span> if thou séest the sore, why do­est thou not applie the salue, and if thou dost perceiue the mischiefe, why doest not preuent it with medicine, take away the cause and the effect faileth, if <span class="hi">Gwydones</span> be the cause of thy ruth, cut him off betimes, least hée bring thée to ruine, better hadst thou want a sonne then neuer want sorow.

You old men most iniustly, or rather iniuriously, measure our stailesse moode by your stayed mindes, our young yeres by your horie haires, our flourishing youth by your wi­thered age, thinking to direct our dooings by your doa­tings, our wills by your wits, our youthfull fancies by your aged affections, and to quench our fierie flames by your dead coales and cinders: yea, supposing that the Leueret shuld be as skilfull in making of a head as the olde Hare, that the young Cubs shoulde as soone tapish, as y<sup>e</sup> old Fox, that y<sup>•</sup> young Frie shuld as wel auoid the net as the olde Fish, and that the young wantons shuld be as warie as the old wysards.

But in my opinion, the fittest kind of life for a young Gentleman to take (who as yet hath not subdued the youthfull conceipts of fancie, nor made a conquest of his will by witte) is to spende his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e647"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=7">[Page 4]</a></span> time in trauell, wherein he shall finde both pleasure and profite: yea, and buy<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> that by experience, which other­wise with all the treasure in the world hée cannot pur­chase. For what chaungeth vanitie to vertue, staylesse wit to stayed wisedome, fonde fantasies to firme affecti­ons, but trauell: what represseth the rage of youth, and redresseth the witlesse furie of wanton yeares, but tra­uell: what tourneth a secure life to a carefull lyuing, what maketh the foolish wise, yea, what increaseth wit and augmenteth skill, but trauell: in so much that the fame <span class="hi">Vlysses</span> wonne, was not by the tenne yeares hee laye at <span class="hi">Troy,</span> but by the time he spent in trauell. But there is nothing <span class="hi">Gwydonius</span> so precious which in some respecte is not perillous, nor nothing so pleasaunt which maye not be painefull: the finest golde hath hys drosse, the purest wine his lées, the brauest rose his pric­kles, each swéete hath his sower, each ioye his annoy, each weale his woe, and euerie delyght his daunger.

Sith then thou shalt beare sayle in such peril­lous Strayghtes, take héede least thou dash thy ship agaynst most daungerous Rockes.

This terrible sight was such a cooling Card to my former con­ceits, as hope was turned to feare, blisse to bale, &amp; suppo­sed happinesse to assured heauinesse. And yet my fancie was not quenched, but rather far the more inflamed, my desire was not diminished, but augmented, &amp; my liking no lesse, but rather inlarged, so that to liue in loue with­out hope was loathsome, to séeke redresse was losse of life, to want my wish was horror, to inioy my will was hell, to liue in care without comfort was calamitie, to séeke for cure was more th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> miserie, not to possesse y<sup>e</sup> pray was hellish daunger, to venture for the prize was haples death.

Yet as a wor­thie Prince, preferring the securitie of his soldiers before the safetie of his owne person, he offered them the com­bat, which <span class="hi">Orlanio</span> to auoide the effusion of bloud, most willingly accepted. Nowe it was agréed and concluded betwéene thē, that two champions might be chosen, who by the dint of the swoord should stint the strife betwéene these two armies. If he of <span class="hi">Metelyne</span> remained victor, then <span class="hi">Orlanio</span> shuld not onely paie his former tribute, but deliuer vp his Dukedome into the hands of <span class="hi">Clerophon­tes.</span> But if y<sup>•</sup> <span class="hi">Alexandrians</span> obtained y<sup>•</sup> conquest, y<sup>•</sup> Duke of <span class="hi">Metelyne</span> should peaceably depart the countrie, release the tribute, and also resigne his state, and become a sub­iect to <span class="hi">Orlanio.</span> And for the better kéeping &amp; confirming of these conditions, they presentlye dispatcht Embassa­dours to <span class="hi">Fernandus</span> the king of <span class="hi">Bohemia,</span> to intreate his maiestie that he would vouchsafe to become iudge in the combat, who for that he wished wel to both these dukes, graunted to their requests, and with as much spéede as might be, came to <span class="hi">Alexandria.</span> But in the meane time there was some difference aboute the champions. For <span class="hi">Clerophontes</span> sayd, that sith in loosing the field, consisted the losse of liuing, life, and libertie, and in getting y<sup>•</sup> vic­torie, the gaine of a Dukedome, he would in proper per­son fight the combat and trie the chance of Fortune, and therefore made a challenge to <span class="hi">Orlanio.</span> But he finding himselfe farre vnfit to resist his furious force, refused it. Yet promising, that none vnlesse he were descended of Nobilitie should enter the lists, wherwith <span class="hi">Clerophon­tes</span> was verie well contented. Nowe while this truce continued, which was prolonged for thirtie dayes, it was lawfull for them of <span class="hi">Alexandria</span> to come and viewe the campe of <span class="hi">Metelyne,</span> and for the <span class="hi">Metelynes</span> to goe and sée the Citie. Wherevpon <span class="hi">Clerophontes</span> desirous to sée <span class="hi">Or­lanio</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7165"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=67">[Page]</a></span> and his Court, went onelye accompanied with his garde to <span class="hi">Alexandria,</span> where he was most royally enter­tained, and sumptuously feasted by <span class="hi">Orlanio,</span> both of them remitting the rigour of their mallice, till it shoulde bee shewed in effect, by reason of their manhood.

For first he fréed <span class="hi">Castania</span> out of prison, thē made generall proclama­tion throughout his Dukedome, y<sup>•</sup> what Lord so euer w<sup>t</sup> ­in his land would try the combat with <span class="hi">Clerophontes,</span> if he remained victor in the conquest, he would not onely giue him his daughter <span class="hi">Castania</span> to wife, let him possesse peaceably the Dukedome of <span class="hi">Metelyne</span> as her dowry, but be content to acknowledge him as his liege, &amp; paye him tribute, as he was wont to <span class="hi">Clerophontes.</span></p><p>While he lingered and listened how this proclamition would preuaile, <span class="hi">Castania</span> hearing this seuere sentence &amp; dolefull doome pronounced, séeing that shoulde not onely <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7262"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=67">[Page 64]</a></span> be forced to forsake <span class="hi">Gwydonius,</span> but be constrained to match in marriage with one whome shée should neyther loue nor like, burst forth into these bitter complaintes.</p><p>A Alasse (quoth she) how pinching a pain it is to be per­plexed with diuers passions, what a noisome care it is to be combred with sundrie cogitations, what a woo it is to hang betwéene desire &amp; despaire, &amp; what a hell it is to houer betwéene feare and hope. For as to him which is assured to die, death is no dolour, in that he perfectlye knowes there is no salue can cure his sorrow, so to him which feares to die, &amp; yet hopes to liue, death were thrice more welcome, then to linger in such doubt.

If my Father <span class="hi">Orlanio</span> winne the conquest, I doubt my desire shall neuer haue happie successe, if <span class="hi">Clerophontes</span> triumphe as victour, I greatly feare his crueltie is such, as I shall not escape most haplesse death.

What caused <span class="hi">Caesar</span> lament that he had not begun to trouble the world<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>in that age, wherin <span class="hi">A­lexander</span> had conquered the greatest part? Why did di­uers séeke to fill vp the valleyes, to make plaine the mountaines, to drye vp riuers, to make bridges ouer the sea, as <span class="hi">Claudius</span> the Emperour did? What made <span class="hi">Rho­dope</span> build the Pyramides, and <span class="hi">Artemisia</span> frame the sumptuous sepulcher? but Folly. In fine, without this Goddesse man should be carefull, heauie, and whollye drowned in sorrow: whereas Folly quickeneth his spi­rite, maketh him sing, daunce, leape, and frame himselfe altogether to pleasure. It is not possible that Loue shuld be without the daughter of youth, which is Folly. For Loue springeth of sodaine and sundry causes, by recey­uing an Apple, as <span class="hi">Cydippe:</span> by looking out at a Win­dowe, as <span class="hi">Scylla:</span> by reading in a Booke, as the Ladye <span class="hi">Frauncis Rymhi:</span> some fall in loue by sight, some by hea­ring, but all liuing in hope to obtane their desires. And yet some haue loued without anye naturall cause, as <span class="hi">Pigmalion,</span> who fell in Loue with his marble picture, &amp; I pray you what <span class="hi">Sympathia</span> could there be betweene a lyuely youth, and a dead stone, what was it then but Folly that kindled this flame? what forced <span class="hi">Narcissus</span> to fall in Loue with his owne shadowe, but Folly. Yea, what aduenture is passed in loue without Folly.</p><p class="p-in-sp"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9007"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=81">[Page]</a></span> For the Philosophers define Folly to be a depriuation of Wisedome, and Wisedome is altogether without passions: of the which when Loue shall be voyde, then no doubt the sea shall be without waues, and the Fire without heate.</p><p class="p-in-sp">Consider but a young man which onely placeth his delight in amorous conceiptes, decking, dressing, and perfuming himselfe most delicately, who passeth out of his lodging, fraught with a thousand sundry fancies, ac­companied with men and pages, passing to the place where he may haue a sight of his Mistres, obtaining for his trauell no gain but perhaps some amorous glaunce, making long sutes, spending his time and his treasure, consuming his wit, and wasting his wealth, and yet reaping nothing but disdaine and discredite. But if it chaunce that his Mistresse condiscend vnto his requests, she appoynteth him to come at some suspitious houre, which he cannot performe without great perill. To come with companie, were to bewray his secrets: to go alone, most daungerous: to goe openly, too manifest: so that he must passe disguised, sometime like a woman, other times like a peasant or some vilde person, scaling the walles with ladders, clyming vp to the windowes by cordes: yea, continually in daunger of death, if Follye did not holde him vp by the hand. It is not also vn­knowen vnto you how manye sundrye passions doo per­plexe the poore passionate Louers, all which procéede of Folly, as to haue ones heart seperated from himselfe, to be nowe in peace and than in warre, now couering his dolour, blushing one while and looking pale another, fraught wholly with feare, hope and shame, séeking that carefully which he séemeth to flie, &amp; yet doubtfully dread­ing not to find it, to laugh seldome, to sigh often, to burn in cold, &amp; fréeze in heate, to be crossed altogether w<sup>t</sup> cōtra­ries, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9028"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6132&amp;page=81">[Page 78]</a></span> which be signs not only of folly but of phrēsie. Who shall excuse <span class="hi">Hercules,</span> handling so carefully the distaffe of <span class="hi">Omphale,</span> or <span class="hi">Salomon</span> for combring himselfe with so ma­ny Concubines, <span class="hi">Annibal</span> in submitting himselfe to his loue, <span class="hi">Aristotle</span> in obeying <span class="hi">Hermia,</span> and <span class="hi">Socrates</span> in yéel­ding to <span class="hi">Aspasia,</span> and many other which we sée daily to be so blinded, as they knowe not themselues, and what is the cause héereof but folly, so that we sée that it is she which maketh loue to be so feared &amp; <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>doubted, it is shée that honoureth him, exalteth his name, and causeth him to be counted as a God. Further, whosoeuer loueth must applie himselfe to the affection of his mistresse, although it be contrarie to his natural constitution, if he be quiet, wise and discréete, yet if his louer please to haue him chaunge his state, he must turne his stearn and hoise his saile to goe with another winde, <span class="hi">Zethius</span> and <span class="hi">Amphion</span> could not agrée, for because the delight of the one was a despight to the other, vntill <span class="hi">Amphion</span> left his musicke. If the Lady whom thou louest be couetous, thou must chaunge thy selfe into golde, and so fall into her bosome, if she be merrie, thou must be pleasaunt, if sullen, thou must be sad. All the seruauntes and sutors to <span class="hi">Atlanta</span> were hunters, because she delighted in that sport. Many Gentlewomen to please their louers which were Poets, left the rocke and the néedle, and tooke in hand pens and bookes: now tell me if these straunge Metamorphosis be not méere pointes of folly? Doe you thinke that a soul­dier which goeth to the assalt, marketh y<sup>e</sup> trenches, thin­keth of his enimies, or of a thousande harguebushes, wherof euerie one is sufficient to destroy him? No, he on­ly hopeth to win the conquest, and doth not so much as once imagine the rest. He which first inuented sailing, doubted not of the perillous daungers: and he that play­eth, neuer thinketh to become a looser, yet are they all thrée in daunger to be slaine, drowned, and vndoone.
