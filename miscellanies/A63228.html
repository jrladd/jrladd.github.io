And there were directions given, and a Courſe taken, that there ſhould be ſome perſon, to tell them whither they ſhould go from thence. After they had met there at ſeveral times in the ſame day, they were appointed, and adjourned to be at ſeveral other places, ſome of them were appointed to be at Mr. <span class="hi">Whitebreads</span> Lodging, and that was in <span class="hi">Wild­ſtreet,</span> at one Mr. <span class="hi">Sanders</span> houſe: Others were appointed, to go <span class="gap" title="〈…〉"> [...]</span> Lodg­ing, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1528"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=100180&amp;page=6">[Page 10]</a></span> which was in <span class="hi">Ruſſelſtreet,</span> (and this Mr. <span class="hi">Ireland</span> was Treaſurer of the Society): an<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> others were to meet at Mr. <span class="hi">Fenwicks</span> Chamber in <span class="hi">Drury-Lane;</span> and he was at that time Procurator and Agent for that Society.

And really, when you conſider the Root from whence this Treaſon ſprings, you will ceaſe wondring that all this ſhould be attempted, and rather wonder that it was not done.</p><p class="p-in-sp">Miſchiefs have often miſcarried for want of wickedneſs enough; the Horror of Con­ſcience, or elſe, the Malice of the Aggreſſor not being equal to the Attempt, has ſome­times prevented the Execution of it.

And yet after all this they have not been able to prevail. Not that we can brag of any hu­man policy that did prevent it; No, all that the Wit of man could do, theſe men had done: but 'twas the Providence of God, 'twas his Revelation; That Providence that firſt enlightened his Church, and has preſerv'd it againſt all oppoſition heretofore, has once more diſappointed their Councells, and preſerved the King and this Nation in the profeſſion of that true Religion theſe men have vainly attempted to deſtroy.</p><p class="p-in-sp">Gentlemen, I will not open to you the particulars of our Evidence, that I had rather ſhould come from the Witneſſes themſelves; I ſhall only in general tell you what will be the Courſe of it.

That af­terwards <span class="hi">Pickering</span> and <span class="hi">Grove</span> did agree to the ſame, and they received the Sacrament upon it as an Oath to make all ſacred, and a Seal to make all ſecret. Mr. <span class="hi">Bedlow</span> hath ſworn as to that particular time of killing the King by <span class="hi">Pickering</span> and <span class="hi">Grove,</span> though they were not to give over the Deſign, but there were four that were ſent to kill the King at <span class="hi">Windſor.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> ſwears there was an attempt by <span class="hi">Pickering</span> in <span class="hi">March</span> laſt, but the Flint of the Piſtol happening to be looſe, he durſt not proceed, for which he was re­warded with Pennance. He ſwears there were Four hired to do it. That Fourſcore pounds was provided for them: He ſaw the money; and ſwears he ſaw it delivered to the Meſſenger to carry it down.</p><div class="speaker">Ireland.</div><p class="p-in-sp">At what time was that?</p><div class="speaker">Lord Chief Juſt.</div><p class="p-in-sp">In <span class="hi">Auguſt</span> there was an attempt firſt by <span class="hi">Pickering</span> and <span class="hi">Grove:</span> they then not doing of it, four other perſons (<span class="hi">Iriſhmen</span>) were hired to do it, and ten thou­ſand pounds profered to Sir <span class="hi">George Wakeman,</span> to poiſon the King. Thus ſtill they go on in their attempts, and, that being too little, five thouſand pounds more was added. This is to ſhew you the Groſs of the Plot in general; and alſo the particular Tranſacti­ons of theſe two murtherers <span class="hi">Grove</span> and <span class="hi">Pickering,</span> with the Conſpiracy of <span class="hi">Ireland. Bed­l<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>w</span> ſwears directly that in <span class="hi">Auguſt</span> laſt, theſe Three and <span class="hi">Harcourt,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Pritchard,</span> and <span class="hi">Le Faire</span> being altogether in a Room, did diſcourſe of the Diſappointment the Four had met with, in not killing the King at <span class="hi">Windſor;</span> And there the Reſolution was, the old ſtagers ſhould go on ſtill, but they had one <span class="hi">Conyers</span> joyned to them, and they were to kill the King then at <span class="hi">Newmarket.</span> He ſwears, they did agree to do it; that <span class="hi">Ireland</span> was at it; and that all three did conſent to that Reſolve. So that here are Two Witneſſes that ſpeak poſitively, with all the Circumſtances of this Attempt, of the Two to kill the King, and the Confederacy of <span class="hi">Ireland</span> all along with them. N<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>w, I muſt tell you, there are no Acceſſaries, but all Principals, in Treaſon. It may ſeem hard perhaps to convict men upon the Teſtimony of their fellow Offenders, and if it had been poſſible to have brought other Witneſſes, it had been well: but, in things of this nature, you cannot expect that the Witneſſes ſhould be abſolutely ſpotleſs. You muſt take ſuch Evidence as the nature of the Thing will afford, or you may have the King deſtroyed and our Religion too: For Jeſuits are too ſubtle to ſubject themſelves to too plain a proof, ſuch as they cannot evade by Equivocation or a flat d<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>nial.</p><p class="p-in-sp">There is alſo a Letter produced, which ſpeaking of the Conſult that was to be the 24th of <span class="hi">April,</span> proves that there was a Conſpiracy among them. And, although, it is not Evidence to convict any one man of them, yet it is Evidence upon <span class="hi">Mr. Oate</span>'s Teſti­ny to prove the general Deſign. It is from one <span class="hi">Petre</span> to one of the Confederates, and taken amongſt <span class="hi">Harcourt,</span> papers, after <span class="hi">Mr Oates</span> had given in his Te<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>imony; and therein it is mentioned, th<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>t the Superior had taken care, that there ſhould be a meeting the 24th of <span class="hi">April,</span> the day after Saint <span class="hi">George</span>'s day, which is the very time <span class="hi">Oates</span> ſpeaks of; and that they were not to come to Town too ſoon, that the Deſign might not be diſcovered. I would ſai<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> know what the ſignification of that Clauſe might be. And then it goes farther, That it was to be kept ſecret, as the nature of the thing do<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>h <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12269"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=100180&amp;page=24">[Page 46]</a></span> require; which ſhews plainly there was ſuch a Tranſaction on foot. But the reaſon I urge it for, is, to ſhew you that it is a concurrent Evidence with <span class="hi">Mr. Oates,</span> who had never ſeen this Paper▪ till th<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ee or four days after his Information was given in, where­in he ſwears the time when this Agitation was to be, and when they came to look upon the Papers; it agrees with the time preciſely. Now they do not write in this Letter that they intended to kill the King; but they write to caution them to keep the De­ſign undiſcovered, and by that you may gueſs what they mean.</p><p class="p-in-sp">What is ſaid to all this by the Priſoners, but Denya's? <span class="hi">Ireland</span> cannot deny but that he knew Mr. <span class="hi">Oates,</span> and had been in his company ſometimes; Five times by Circum­ſtances, Mr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> hath proved, ſo that they were acquaintance; and it appears plain­ly there was a Familiarity between them. <span class="hi">Ireland</span> objects that <span class="hi">Bedlow</span> charges him in <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> when he was out of Town all that time, and that therefore the Teſtimony of one of the Witneſſes cannot be true. And to prove this he calls his Mother, his Si­ſter, and Sir <span class="hi">John Southcot</span>'s man, and Mr. <span class="hi">Gifford.</span> His mother and ſiſter ſay expreſly, that he went out of Town the third of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> and the Servant ſays, that he ſaw him at St <span class="hi">Al­bans,</span> the fifth of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> and continued in his company to the ſixteenth; (ſo that, as to that there is a Teſtimony bo<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>h againſt <span class="hi">Mr. Bedlow,</span> and againſt Mr. <span class="hi">Oates;</span>) and <span class="hi">Gifford</span> comes and ſays, he ſaw him at the latter end of of <span class="hi">Auguſt</span> and beginning of <span class="hi">September</span> at <span class="hi">Wolverhampton;</span> whereas <span class="hi">Mr. Oates</span> hath ſworn, he ſaw him the twelfth of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> and the firſt or ſecond of <span class="hi">September,</span> and tells it by a particular Circumſtance, wherein I muſt tell you, it is impoſſible that both ſides ſhould be true. But if it ſhould be a miſtake only in point of time, it deſtroys not the Evidence, unleſs you think it nec<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ſſa­ry to the ſubſtance of the thing. If you charge one in the month of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> to have done ſuch a Fact, if he deny that he was in that place at that time, and proves it by Witneſſes, it may go to invalidate the Credibility of a mans Teſtimony, but it does not invalidate the Truth of the Thing it ſelf, which may be true in ſubſtance though the circumſtance of Time differ. And the Queſtion is, whether the thing be true?</p><p class="p-in-sp">Againſt this, the Council for the King have Three, that ſwear it poſitively and ex­preſly, That <span class="hi">I<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>eland</span> was here. Here is a young Maid that knew him very well, and wa<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> acquainted with him and with his breaking up of Letters; and ſhe is one that was <span class="hi">Grove</span>'s Servant: ſhe comes, and tells you directly, That about that time which, by Computation, was about the twelfth of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> ſhe ſaw him go into his own houſe, which cannot be true, if that be true which is ſaid on the other ſide▪ and ſhe does ſwear it upon better Circumſtances, then if ſhe had barely pitch'd upon a day; for ſhe muſt have ſatisfied me well, for what reaſon ſhe could remember the day ſo poſitively, ere I ſhould have believed her: But ſhe does it remembring her going to my Lord <span class="hi">Ar­lingtons</span> Service, which was a week after the King went to <span class="hi">Windſor;</span> which is ſworn to be about the thirteenth of <span class="hi">Auguſt,</span> and a week before her going it was that ſhe ſaw <span class="hi">Ire­land</span> at his own door. What Arts they have of evading this, I know not, for a<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> they have t<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>rned their Learning into Subtlety, ſo they have their Integrity too.

For <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>he<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> are the admirable Documents of that Religion we in <span class="hi">England</span> profeſs, That we dare not requite Maſſacre for Maſſacre, Blood for Blood. We diſown and abhor all Stabbing; and we are ſo far from reckoning, that he ſhall be a Saint in Heaven for aſſaſſinating a Prince, and be prayed to in another world, that the Proteſtant is requi­red to believe, that ſuch that begin with Murther, muſt end with Damnation, if our bleſſed Lord and Saviour do not interpoſe; nothing that man can do, Papiſt or Prote­ſtant, can ſave any man in ſuch a caſe. We dare not ſay, that our Religion will per­mit us to murder Diſſenters, much leſs to aſſaſſinate Our King.</p><p class="p-in-sp">And having thus ſaid, let me once more, as a Chriſtian, in the name of the great God of Heaven, beg of you, for your own Souls ſake, be not ſatisfied or overperſwaded with any Doctrine that you have preached to others, or imbibed from others, but believe that no one can contrive the Death of the King, or the overthrow of the Go­vernment; but the great God of Heaven and Earth will have an account of it▪ and all Pardons, Abſolutions, and the Diſpenſations that you who are Prieſts can give to your Lay-brother, or that any of your Superiors may give to you, will not ſerve the turn.</p><p class="p-in-sp">I know not, but as I ſaid, you may think I ſpeak this to inſult, I take the Great God of Heaven to witneſs that I ſpeak it with Charity to your Souls, and with great ſorrow and grief in my own heart, to ſee men that might have made themſelves happy, draw upon themſelves ſo great a ruin▪ But ſince you have been ſo fairly heard, ſo fairly tryed and con­victed, there is but little more to be ſaid; For I muſt tell you, becauſe it may not be thought that you had not free liberty to make your full Defence, though that Gentleman (ſpeak­ing to <span class="hi">Ireland</span>) ſeemed to be ſurprized, he had a kind Siſter that took care for to bring his Witneſſes; I am ſo far from blaming her for it, that I do commend her, it was the Ef­fect of her good Nature, and deſerves Commendation; but I ſpeak to this purpoſe, to ſhew that there was no ſurprize upon him, nor his Life taken away by any ſuch thing; for he had a greater favour ſhewed to him than is uſually ſhown to ſuch Offen­ders.</p><p class="p-in-sp">And having thus ſaid to you my ſelf, We do alſo require him whoſe duty it is to at­tend in ſuch caſes, nay, I do command him in the name of the Court, that he attend upon you to give, you all the comfortable aſſiſtance that he can, for the advan­tage of your future ſtate: And not only ſo, but we will cer<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ainly take care, that if you will have any others come to you, they ſhall. I would not be miſtaken, I do not mean any of your Prieſts and Jeſuits; but if you will have the aſſiſtance of any Proteſtant Di­vines, they ſhall not be denyed you. And I hope, God Almighty will pleaſe to give you pardon in another world, though you have offended beyond hopes of any in this. I once more aſſure you, all I have ſaid is in perfect charity.
