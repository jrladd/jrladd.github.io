A Tale of a Pack of Cards.</span></h2><p>NOt many Ages ſince, a Parſon of a Country Uillage, was accuſed to a Committee that he was a great Gameſter at Cards: being ſo addicted thereunto, that he would oftentimes play on Sundays: the Com­mittee thus informed, ſent forthwith for the Parſon, to anſwer his accuſation: who receiving the Warrant, made no excuſes or delay, but with all the haſte he could, made his appearance before them; with whom alſo came the Infor­mer to juſtifie his Accuſation. Being thus met together, the Committee began to ſchool the Parſon, that one of his calling ſhould be ad­dicted to ſuch Uice, as to be noted for a Common player at Cards. Indeed, ſaid the Parſon, I am ſo far from the ſame, that I do not know <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e695"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=35938&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> what a pair of Cards meaneth. Sir, qd. the In­former, if you pleaſe to ſearch his Pockets, I believe you will find a pair there at this pre­ſent, for he ſeldom goeth without ſuch tack­ling; whereupon the Committee commanding his pockets to be ſearcht, they found a pair of Cards there indeed: but the Parſon denied them for to be Cards, ſaying, they may be Cards to you, but to me they are an Almanack: and be­ing demanded how he could make it appear, he anſwered thus: Firſt (quoth he) here is as many ſuits of Cards as there be quarters in a year; and as many Court Cards as there be months in a year; as many Cards as there are weeks in a year; and as many ſpots as there be days in a year. Then when I look upon the King, it puts me in mind of the alle­giance that I owe to my Soveraign Lord the King, looking upon the queen, puts me in mind of the like Allegiance that I owe to the <span class="hi">Queen;</span> the ten puts me in mind of the ten Command­ments, the nine of the nine Muſes; the eight of the eight Altitudes; the ſeven of the ſeven liberal Sciences; the ſix of the ſix days we ought to labour in: the five of the five Sen­ſes; the four of the four Evangeliſts; the three of the Trinity; the two of the two Sa­craments: &amp; the Ace, that we ought to worſhip but one God.
