If you will not anger her, ſhe will be angry with you for thus neglecting her: and you cannot vex her worſe, than to be ſilent, unleſs you ſing or whiſtle at her Folly.

Yet is not that her onely weapon; for ſhe has Hands to Clap with, and Nails to Scratch with, and Teeth to Bite with, and much more Furniture for War; ſo that being lookt upon as Invincible, her bad humour gets her a <span class="hi">Priviledge:</span> for where-ever ſhe comes, ſhe may be ſure to have the <span class="hi">Room</span> to her ſelf; nor needs long Conteſt for priority of <span class="hi">Walk,</span> or pre­cedency at <span class="hi">Table,</span> or opinion in Argument: for the <span class="hi">proudeſt Goſſip</span> will quit Pretenſions, rather than ſtand the <span class="hi">ſhock</span> of her well-known <span class="hi">Rhe­torick.</span></p><p>If ſhe be of the preciſer Caſt, ſhe abuſes <span class="hi">Sa­cred Language</span> in her Railing, as Conjurers do in their Charms; calls her Neighbours <span class="hi">Heathen E­domites,</span> her Huſband, <span class="hi">Reprobate,</span> or <span class="hi">Son of Belial,</span> and will not <span class="hi">cudgel</span> her Maid without a Text for't.

A full Glaſs ſeaſonably offered, may ſome­times pacifie her for a moment; but immediately the Ill ſpirit returns, and ſhe can be quiet onely juſt ſo long as ſhe is drinking. Thus ſhe clamours at him ſo long without occaſion, that at laſt he gives her enough; and rails at him for keeping Ill Company, till ſhe forces him to it; being a­ſham'd to go into any Good Society, or they a­ſham'd of him; which makes him ſeek blinde Bubbing-ſchools to hide himſelf in from her fury, and reſolve to ſtay out all Night, rather than en­dure a double Rally.</p><p>In a word, (for I perceive our Character begins to be infected with the contagious Talkativeneſs of its ſubject) a <span class="hi">virulent Scold</span> is her Neighbours perpetual Diſquiet, her Families Evil Genius, her Huſbands Ruine, and her own dayly Tormentor: And that you may the better know her Pedigree, I'll give you a ſerious Account of the Receipt or Method made uſe of for her Production into the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e433"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=95637&amp;page=4">[Page 7]</a></span> world, lately found in a long-concealed Manuſcript of <span class="hi">Theophraſtus Bombaſtus Paracelſus,</span> as follows: <span class="hi">viz.</span></p><p>That Nature long ſince finding many of her Sons oft-times bewitcht to their own Ruine by the Charms of Women, for their puniſhment con­triv'd this Monſter call'd <span class="hi">A Scold:</span> To form which,</p><p>She firſt took of the Tongues and Galls of Bulls, Bears, Wolves, Magpies, Parrets, Cuckows, and Nightingales, of each a like number: The Tongues and Tails of Vipers, Adders, Snakes and Lizards, Seven apiece: Aurum Fulminans, Aqua Fortis and Gun-powder, of each one pound: The Clap­pers of Nineteen Bells, and the Peſtles of a dozen Apothecaries Mortars.
