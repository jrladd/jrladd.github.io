THere was a Beautiful Damſel of late,

whom many young Men did admire,

One above all of a worthy Eſtate

came to her, and love did require:

Soon he obtain'd this amorous Maid,

and all things was decently carry'd,

Five hundred pounds to her Portion was paid,

the very day that ſhe was Marry'd.

This being paid, and all over and done,

her father to ſhow himſe [...]f Noble,

Said, at the Birth of a Daughter or Son,

This Portion I promiſe to double:

Therefore I ſay make much of your Bride,

till then I will ſtill be your Debtor;

Yet Seven Years he did lye by her ſide,

poor Soul ſhe was never the better.

There was no hopes of an heir being born,

therefore he was much diſcontented,

All his old Cronies did laugh him to ſcorn,

alas! he was dally tormented,

Some they would ſay, were you worth your Ears,

you ne'r would have bauk't ſuch a Beauty,

For to lye by her full ſeven long Years,

and not perform Family Duty.

True, he would ſtroak her a [...]d make a ſtrange rou [...]

nay, kiſs her, and ca [...]l her his Honey,

But ſomething elſe muſt be done without doubt,

e're he has the reſt of the Mony:

Many a Sigh alas! ſhe let fly,

I here am debar'd of all pleaſure,

Had ever Maid ſuch hard fo [...]tune as I,

I weep and lament out of meaſure.

Then was he troubled to ſee her ſo ſad,

for why, ſhe no longer could wave it;

If any help in the World can be had,

my Deareſt, ſaid he, thou ſhalt have it;

For as I am a right-honeſ't Man,

you know I was never unwilling,

But yet I can do no more then I can,

you ne'r wanted Kiſſing and Billing.

There is a luſty lad lives at the Mill,

who I have a fancy to hire,

Be n [...] a man of much Practiſe and Skill,

I am ſure he will grant your deſire:

Then will thy joys and bleſſings abound,

when as he has made thee a Mother;

Before I will looſe the Five Hundred Pound,

I'le give the one half for the other.

Yet I will get him as cheap as I can,

I think it is nothing but reaſon:

He is I tell you a right honeſt Man.

and knows how to do things in ſeaſon:

Now it ſha [...]l be no longer deterr'd,

I'le go to this Robin my Neighbour,

With me I think he will not ſtand too hard,

I'le give him Ten Pound for his labour.

He ſhall be ſworn our Counſel to keep,

and not make the Country acqua [...]nted,

Then what he Sows I do reckon to Reap,

ſ [...]eet Wife let the time be appointed:

And he in private ſhall come and go,

then though you lye often together,

There is no Creature alive need to know,

but that I am ſtill the right Father.

FINIS.
