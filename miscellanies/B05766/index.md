## 1\. The Seamen and Soudiers Laſt Farwel to their Deareſt Jewels.

He muſt be gone, the Fates have ſo decreed,

To ſerve his King and Countrey in their need:

In fight againſt the Dutch upon the Main,

Yet he's in hopes to ſee his Love again:

He chears her up, and bids ſhe ſhould not Mourn,

But wait with patience for his ſafe return.

The tune is, I am ſo deep in Love, or, Cupids Courteſie

_[figure]_

FArewel my deareſt dear,

now I muſt leave thée,

Thy ſight I muſt forbear

although it grives me:

From thy imbraces love

ſhall be parted:

Yet will I conſtant prove

and be true-hearted.

My fortune I will try

upon the Ocean,

And fight moſt valiantly

to gain promotion;

My deareſt blood i'le ſpend

for this our Nation,

My Country to defend

from Foes invaſion.

Princes of high renown

are now ingaged,

To pull the courage down

of Foes inraged:

Dukes, Lords & gentry high,

all are preparing

Their valour for to try,

no coſt is ſparing.

Why ſhould I grudge to fight

under the Banners,

Of ſuch approved Knights

and brave Commanders:

My chanceI mean to try,

I ſcorn to hide me,

I'le face the Enemy

what e're betide me,

_[figure]_

_[figure]_

WHen I am on the Seas

in haile and thunder,

Where ſtorms do raiſe the waves

to all mens wonder,

When Billows bruſh the ſky

and tempeſts threat me,

Still on thy name I'le cry

I'le nor forget thée

Though Hogan Mogan States

doe drag and bluſter,

And call upon their Mates

forces to muſter,

We 'I make them for to know

we can diſturb them,

Once again they muſt bow

England will curb them.

In mid'ſt of ſkirmiſh hot

when blowes are dealing,

Fiery balls fly about

and ſhips are realing:

When Cannons are roaring

and bullets are flying,

He that will honour win

Muſt not fear dying.

My deareſt do not moan

let not grief move thée,

When I am from thee gone

ſtill I will love thee,

If fortune me befriend,

thou mayſt he certaine

He often to thee ſend

after our parting.

Thy Love I'le think upon

in greateſt danger,

When I am from thee gone

I'le Love no ſtranger,

No fleſh alive ſhall make

me prove unconſtant;

I will wait for thy ſake,

till the laſt inſtant,

This piece of Gold we'l break,

love, nor a token,

Which as a pledge we'l keep

of faith unbroken,

When thou the ſame doſt ſee

in my long abſence,

Then love remember me

though at a diſtance.

Hark how the Drums do beat

with Trumpets ſounding

Souldiers in furious heat

foes would be wounding

From thy ſweet company

although it grieves me

I muſt divided be

and fore't to leave thee,

My Captain calls away

in haſt they hurry

To march without delay

I may not tarry,

Patiently thou muſt hear

love, leave thy weeping,

Farewell my deareſt dear,

till our next meeting.

Finis

With Allowance.
