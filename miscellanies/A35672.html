Let them be what they will, they are the most valuable things that I have to offer: and the Obligations which I have to your Lordship are so extraordinary, that to endeavour to make no return, would be down right Ingratitude. Your Lordship will be inclin'd to think me bold to excess, when you hear me <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e233"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> boasting of Favours receiv'd from you, tho perhaps you have never so much as heard of me. Yet, I desire leave to repeat it, the Obligations which I have to you are altogether Extraordinary. For it is owing to your Lordship that I have pass'd some moments of a melancholy Life with inexpressible pleasure. For as read­ing has always been my chief di­version, your Lordships admirable Writings have been able to give me joy in spight of ill Fate. Your happy and commanding Genius never fail'd to controule my evil weaker one, and seem'd still to cry out to it, <span class="hi">Whilst I am by, he must not be unhappy.</span></p><p>Nor have I only the obligation to your Lordship of your own incomparable Wri­tings, but of most of the productions of the best Writers of our Age. 'Tis from your Generous Approbation, that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e246"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> they have deriv'd that spirit which renders their Works Immortal. For when ever a Man who is so true­ly great as your Lordship, shall vouch­safe to look with a favourable aspect on Poetry, it will not fail to flou­rish, tho all the Stars look malignant­ly. Ev'n I, My Lord, who am no Poet, have notwithstanding found that the desire of pleasing so accomplish'd a Iudge, has more than once inspir'd me with that noble warmth, which Hea­ven and Nature deny'd me. When Heaven sent <span class="hi">Mecoenas</span> into the World to be first Minister to the Common­wealth of <span class="hi">Rome</span> and of Learning, then arose <span class="hi">Virgil</span> and <span class="hi">Horace,</span> and the rest of those extraordinary Men, whose very single Names are grown to be entire and glorious Panegyricks. When several Ages after him, Cardinal <span class="hi">Richlieu</span> was establish'd in <span class="hi">France</span> in his double Capacity, the Muses were in­vited <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e282"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> to pass the Mountains, and breath the sweetness of the Gallick Air. Af­ter <span class="hi">Mecoenas</span> and Cardinal <span class="hi">Richlieu,</span> your Lordship will stand eternally re­corded by Fame, as the last in succes­sion of that Illustrious Triumvirate, and it will always stand recorded to­gether by the same everlasting Regi­ster, That in your Lordship's time <span class="hi">England</span> had more good Poets, than it could boast from the Conquest to Yo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> before. By animating and exci­ting the very best of which, you will for ever oblige all those who are to receive Delight and Instruction from them. Thus is your goodness grown so diffusive, that its influence extends to thousands whom you never heard of. <span class="hi">Ti­tus</span> was the Delight and Ioy of man­kind, but your Lordship is, and for ever will be so. You have found out a better way than either <span class="hi">Mecoenas</span> or <span class="hi">Richlieu,</span> to oblige not only the present Age, but <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e325"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> ev'n remotest Posterity. For if we cherish <span class="hi">Mecoenas</span> his Memory, tho we know that he endeavour'd at the same time to polish and enslave the World; if the Memory of <span class="hi">Richlieu</span> be dear to us, tho at the same time that he treated the Muses magnificently, he laid the cursed design of <span class="hi">Europe</span>'s Cap­tivity: with what blessings must not we mention your Lordship, when we con­sider that we owe at once our Delight and our Safety to you? For at the very time that you are the De­light and Ioy of your Age, and Or­nament of your Country, at the ve­ry time that you exalt the Honour of <span class="hi">England</span> by your own admirable Writings, and the Labours of those Excellent Men, whom your authentick applause inspires; at the same time by giving wholesome Counsels to our Au­gust Monarch, you become instrumen­tal in the defence of our Liberties, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e355"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> and the general security of the Christian World. <span class="hi">Mecoenas</span> and <span class="hi">Richlieu</span> pro­tected the Muses, but their Protecti­on was partly at least political, and necessary for the gaining or softning some unruly Spirits, who would have been else too turbulent for the New Yoak. But your Lordship's Patronage proceeds from no sinister end, no un­just design on our Liberties; but pure­ly from the greatness of your noble Mind, and a Godlike principle of inbred Beneficence.</p><p>Thus, My Lord, have I been guil­ty of a fault which is common to all the most supportable Dedications. For I have hitherto told the Publick no­thing concerning you, but what I learnt from the Publick before. There is no Man but knows that of all the Nobility your Lordship has been always the most true and most can­did <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e380"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> Friend to the Muses. Whilst o­thers are imploy'd in finding their faults, it is your prerogative to par­don them, and approve their Beauties. This is what is known to every one. But every one does not know that to find faults requires but com­mon Sense; but to discern rare Beau­ties, requires a rare Genius. Thus if your Lordship will pardon so poeti­cal a Similitude, when one of the glo­ries of the fairer Sex, one who was fram'd and design'd by Providence to bless some Man who is greatly good, and give an earnest of Heaven below to him; when such a one is at any time seen amongst us, the vulgar Spe­ctators, those Criticks in Beauty, are busie in censuring some Mole or some Blemish, or some inconsiderable Irre­gularity, which Nature industriously perhaps contriv'd with intention to set off her great Masterpiece. But when <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e400"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> a Man who has a Soul that in crea­ting was form'd to be mov'd by Beau­ty, that is, a beautiful Soul, when he contemplates her, he gazes, admires, and loves in a Moment; then follow transporting impatient wishes to return that happiness he receives from the lovely Object. Your Lord­ship could never be the Muses best Friend, if you were not the Man who understood them best. If you had not heighth of Genius, and largeness of Soul to comprehend all their Excellencies: If you did not sensibly feel their ele­vation of thought with all its warmth, its force and its delicacy; which you could never fully discern, if you did not throughly understand their Tongues, if you had not skill to judge of its finest Grace, its Vigour, its Purity, its judicious Boldness, its comprehensive Energy, and all its glorious attractive ornaments. Your Lordship could ne­ver <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e413"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> be compleatly skill'd in those or­naments, if you had not a piercing and a delicate Eye; and Eye that can readi­ly judge betwixt tawdry Trimming and proper, that can discern betwixt gay and curious Colours, and can distinguish vaingawdy Pageantry, from pompous richness and true Magnificence. You could never converse with the Muses so freely as to understand them fully, if you did not perfectly speak that language of the Gods, in all its Sweetness, all its A­bundance in all the power of its various Numbers, and in all its <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Maje­sty. No, My Lord, you could never be pleas'd to a height with the Writings of others, if in writing, your self you had not felt those happy Enthusiasms, those violent Emotions, those supernatural transports which exalt a <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> above mortality, give delight and admiration to all the World, but shak<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> and ravish a <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> Soul with insupportable pleasu<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e446"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> But it is high time to take leave of a Subject which throws me into a heat, which is very inconsistent with the respect that is due to your Lord­ship's Character.</p><p>Otherwise it would be no hard mat­ter to prove from the same affection which you bear to the Muses, that your Lordship's Virtue shines as bright as your Genius.</p><div class="q">Carmen amat quisquis Carmine digna gerit.</div><p>But there is small need of proving that Virtue which all men discover by its own light. Your Lordship's Genius shines but to a fe<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, to none but those happy few, who have some parti­cles in their breasts of the same eter­nal Fire. For inspiration alone can capacitate a Mortal to behold Celestial <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e466"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=8">[Page]</a></span> Beauties. The Vulgar discern it as they do a fix'd Star, they see that it is, they see that it shines: but the Rays that it casts at that infinite distance, can but just reach their benighted Souls thro the horrid gloom that surrounds them; and it is with pleasing wonder that they hear the Sons of Art pro­claiming its prodigious Grandeur, its amazing Glory. But all men have a clear Idea of Virtue, tho few have a just notion of Genius. Your Virtue, My Lord, like the Sun, is nearer to them, tho that too is at a mighty di­stance, yet not so remote but that at the time that it cherishes them, it casts more light upon them, than their Souls can directly <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ear.</p><p>Who does not admire your Goodness, your Charity, your generous Condescen­sion, your greatness of Mind, your no­blest Friendship; and to crown all, your <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e484"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> Passionate Concern for your Countries welfare? These are the qualities which have caus'd your Lordship to be belov'd universally, nay, and be­lov'd too with as much warmth as if you were neither much esteem'd nor respected, yet at the same time so profoundly esteem'd, and in that aw­full manner respected, as if you were not belov'd. The news of your late Promotion was receiv'd with the universal acknowledgement, That your Lordship was an honour to that most noble Order, which is an honour to Kings; and we all cryed out una­nimously with your own <span class="hi">Horace,</span> <span class="q">‘Mecoenas equitum decus!’</span></p><p>But I must be forc'd to stop short in this full career, lest proceeding I should please all Readers but you, whom of all Readers I would least dis­please. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e503"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=9">[Page]</a></span> Before I conclude, I think fit to acquaint your Lordship, that I omitted the prefixing your name to this bold Epistle for several reasons: the chief of which is that I might not be liable to the accusation which one of our greatest Wits has some time since brought against dedicating Authors; which is, that they paint so grosly, that it were impossible to know for whom the Dawbers design'd their Pictures, if they did not, to inform us, set their names on the Top. I appeal to all those who shall happen to read this, if before they found you nam'd, they did not conclude that what has been said all along could be addrest to no man, and justly applyed to no man, but my Lord <span class="hi">Dorset</span> alone.

Some of them demanded the Enthusiastick Spirit; and all that others were capa­pable of was a little good Sense, and an air of Gaity. The first were the most difficult to handle by much; which yet, if they should chance to be manag'd aright, would make me an ample a mends for my toil. For tho <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e525"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> mear Enthusiasm is but Madness, no­thing can be more noble than that which is rightly regulated; and no­thing can come nearer that which I fancy to be a true description of Wit; which is a just mixture of Reason and Extravagance, that is such a mixture as reason may always be sure to predominate, and make its mortal Enemy subservient to its grand design of discovering and illu­strating sacred Truth. When I writ the Pindarick Ode, the high Idea that I had of the Subject and of the way of writing, made me resolve to spare for no Pains before I set Pen to Paper, that I might form a design which might have something great and Pindarical. For the skilful Reader will easily discern, that the disorder in that Ode is studied, and that the Transitions which appear so wild and so foreign, tend directly to shew what I design'd to prove, <span class="hi">viz.</span> That <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e537"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=11">[Page]</a></span> the happiness of <span class="hi">England,</span> and the Success of the Confederacy depended on the King's Person. How I have succeeded I must leave to the Readers to judge; yet not to every Reader. For the Pindarick way, if you'l give cre­dit to a great Master, is dangerous both to Writer and Reader. The first must have some qualities at the time of writing, which are rare­ly to be found together, as Precipi­tation and Address, Boldness and De­cency, Sublimeness and Clearness, Fu­ry and Sense; the last inust have Fan­cy to see his flights, and Skill to judge of their Art. He who mounts the Pin­darick Pegasus may be compar'd to a man a Hawking, who rides at all up­on a headlong Hunter, with his Eye still fix'd on a towring Game, so that he must not only have something of Art, but of Happiness besides, to escape a Fall. Let my Fortune be what it will, my comfort is this, That <span class="hi">Eng­land,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e565"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> since, Mr. <span class="hi">Cowle ys</span> time, has not seen many Pindarick Odes, whose Authors have reason to boast of their kind reception.</p><p>I should now say something of the Verses upon the Sea-Fight, and one or two Copies more. But tho they have something in them that seems bold to presumption; yet they have already met with such kind entertain­ment in the World, that the consi­deration of that in some measure as­sures me.</p><p>But since almost a third of this little Book consists of Burlesque Com­posures, and since Burlesque, at present, lies under the disadvantage of ha­ving two great Authorities against it, viz. <span class="hi">Boileau</span>'s, and Mr. <span class="hi">Drydens:</span> I think my self oblig'd not only upon that account, but upon considerati­on too of that wonderful pleasure which I have so often receiv'd from <span class="hi">Butler,</span> to vindicate Burlesque from <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e596"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=12">[Page]</a></span> the scandal that is brought upon it, by the Censures of two such extraor­dinary Men.</p><p>The charge of <span class="hi">Boileau</span> is in his Art of Poetry, <span class="hi">Chant pre</span> in these Lines. </p><div class="q"><div class="l">Quoyque vous ecriviez, evitez la bassesse</div> <div class="l">Le style, le moins noble, a pourtant sa no­blesse,</div> <div class="l">Au mepris du bon sens le Burlesque ef­fron<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>é.</div> <div class="l">Trompa les yeux d'abo<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d, pleut parsa noveaute,</div> <div class="l">On ne vid plus en vers que pointes tri­viales;</div> <div class="l">Le Parnasse parla le language des Hales.</div></div><p><span class="hi">Which in</span> English <span class="hi">paraphrastick Prose, is thus:</span> Whatever you write, let a Gentleman's manner appear in it; The lowest stile of the man, who knows how to write, will still have a noble Air with it. But rightly to observe this rule, you must be sure to decline Burlesque, which not long since in­solently <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e654"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=13">[Page]</a></span> appear'd in contempt of Reason, and pleas'd at the expence of good Sense: it pleas'd indeed a while, but pleas'd only as it was a fantastick novelty: It debas'd the dignity of Verse by its tri­vial Points, and taught <span class="hi">Parnassus</span> a <span class="hi">Billingsgate</span> Dialect.</p><p>This indeed is a violent charge, and may hold very good against <span class="hi">Sca­ron,</span> and the <span class="hi">French</span> Burlesque; but there is not one Article of it but what will fall to the Ground, if it comes to be apply'd to <span class="hi">Butler. Sca­ron</span>'s Burlesque has nothing of a Gentleman in it, little of good Sense, and consequently little of true Wit. For tho there may be good Sense found without Wit, there can be no true Wit, where there is no good Sense. For a Thought that is really witty, must necessarily be true, and have something in it that's Solid; So that Quibbles and all Equivocals can have little or nothing of true Wit in them. Wit is a just mixture of Reason and Ex­travagance, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e682"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=13">[Page]</a></span> and the Extravagance must be there, only in order to give the Reason the more lustre. Now that there is little of Reason and good Sense in <span class="hi">Scaron</span>'s Burlesque, all who are accquainted with him, very well know; Instead of it there are equi­vocals and trivial points in abundance. His language is so very mean that it may well be call'd <span class="hi">le language des Hales. Scaron</span> therefore pleas'd but a while (by his Burlesque, I mean, for his Novels will certainly please eternally) and I do not remember that he has been imitated by any one of the fa­mous <span class="hi">French</span> Wits. It is no wonder if his manner with all these ill qualities, has been rejected by the <span class="hi">French</span> Court, and condemn'd by this judicious Poet and Critick.</p><p>But the contrary of whatever has been said of <span class="hi">Scaron,</span> is certainly true of <span class="hi">Butler?</span> There is seen much of a Gentleman in his Burlesque; There <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e709"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> is so much Wit and Goodsense to be found in him, and so much true ob­servation on mankind, that I do not believe there is more, take Volume for Volume in any one Author we have, the <span class="hi">Plain-Dealer</span> only excepted; Besides, there is a vivacity and purity in his Lan­guage, whereever it was fit it should be pure, that could proceed from nothing but from a generous Educati­on, and from a happy Nature. And further <span class="hi">Butler</span>'s Burlesque was certain­ly writ with a just design, which was to expose Hypocrisie. <span class="hi">Scaron</span>'s Burlesque, was writ either with no de­sign, or but with a very scurvy one. For the only design that can be ima­gin'd of his <span class="hi">Virgil Travesty,</span> was to ridicule Heroick Poetry, which is the noblest invention of human Wit. Since then, <span class="hi">Butler</span> excell'd in so ma­ny things in which <span class="hi">Scaron</span> is defective, we may very well conclude, That <span class="hi">Boi­leau</span>'s accusation reaches not our <span class="hi">Eng­lish</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e756"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> Poet. Which Sir <span class="hi">William Soames</span> saw very well, when he translated this Art of Poetry, for he was so far from declaring against Burlesque, that he ventur'd, tho it was foreign from his Author, to propound <span class="hi">Butler</span> as a model to those who had a mind to write it. The late Lord <span class="hi">Rochester,</span> who was very well acquainted with <span class="hi">Boileau,</span> and who defer'd very much to his Judgment, did not at all be­lieve that the censure of <span class="hi">Boileau</span> ex­tended to <span class="hi">Butler:</span> For if he had, he would never have follow'd his fashion in several of his masterly Copies. Nor would a noble Wit, who is a living Honour to his Country, and the <span class="hi">English</span> Court, have condescen­ded to write Burlesque, if he had not discern'd that there was in <span class="hi">Butler</span>'s manner something extreamly fine, as well as something extreamly sensible in very many of his Thoughts.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e792"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> I now come to examine Mr. <span class="hi">Dry­den</span>'s objections to <span class="hi">Butler,</span> which I shall do with all the submission and deference that is due to the judgment of that extraordinary Man. And therefore I have reason to hope that I shall give no offence to him nor to any Man, by undertaking my own defence. For to plead the Cause of <span class="hi">Butler</span> is at present to maintain my own. For if he who is so admira­ble an Original, is rightly reprehen­ded for writing in Burlesque: I who am but his follower, and can never pretend to come near his excellence, ought much more severely to be censur'd. I must confess that in Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span>'s accusation of Burlesque, there are no such murdering Articles, as there are in that of <span class="hi">Boileau</span> against <span class="hi">Scaron;</span> For Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> allows <span class="hi">But­ler</span> to have shewn a great deal of good Sense in that way of writing; so that we have here gain'd one conside­rable <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e830"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=15">[Page]</a></span> Point, which <span class="hi">Boileau</span> seem'd not to allow us, which is that good Sense is consistent with Burlesque. Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span>'s quarrel is to the num­bers of <span class="hi">Butler:</span> he says that he might have chosen a better sort, affirming that he would equally have excelld in all.</p><p>Whether he would have practised all sorts of Numbers with equal fe­licity, is what I have not now time to examine. But granting that, it is more than probable that he chose aright. For I would fain ask any man one question; Whether he thinks Nature had given <span class="hi">Butler</span> a Talent to treat of the adventures of <span class="hi">Hudibras?</span> For if any one grants that she had given him such a Talent, I will not stick to affirm that it could not fail to suggest to him the proper­est means for the carrying on his design.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e858"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></span> Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span>'s objections to the Numbers of <span class="hi">Butler</span> are two, the first is to the Measure, the second to the Rhymes. The Verse of eight Syllables he says is too scanty, and there is not room enough for the Thought to turn it self with ease in it. But how vain a thing is it to argue against ex­perience? For <span class="hi">Butler</span> has not only as many and as beautiful thoughts as most Authors, but he is as clear a Writer. Besides, Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> may be pleas'd to remember that the most sensible Copy of Verses in all <span class="hi">Waller,</span> is in the measure of eight Syllables, which is that which begins, <span class="q">‘Anger in hasty words or blows.’</span></p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> himself in his Preface to the second part of the <span class="hi">Sylvae,</span> ad­vises all who attempt the Pindarick way, to confine themselves chiefly to Lyrical Numbers: and Numbers <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e891"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=16">[Page]</a></span> which are truly Lyrical are seldom to be extended beyond the eight syllable. His practice too is very a­greable to his precept in his incom­parble Translation of <span class="hi">Tyrrhena Regum Progenies.</span> Now it is plain that in the Pindarick way the Thoughts rise, and the Soul swells more, if I may have leave to use that expression, than in any other sort of writing. Whereas in Satyr the thoughts ought to be more simple, and the expressions less mag­nificent. It follows from what has been said, that if the measure of eight syllables is agreeable in Pinda­rick Verse; it is much more agreea­ble to Burlesque, which is a kind of Satyr. Besides it is apparent that in Burlesque, the measure is often ex­tended to the ninth and sometimes to the tenth syllable.</p><p>But it is high time to say some­thing of the Rhymes. Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> complains that they return too thick <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e916"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=17">[Page]</a></span> upon us: but then the thoughts have the quicker turns, and I never can be persuaded that succinctness can be a fault in writing, unless it be destructive of perspicuity. It is ob­jected that double and treble Rhymes are effeminate, and debase the digni­ty of Verse below manly Satyr. But this objection will be in force too against <span class="hi">Tassone,</span> whose manner Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> seems to approve of: For he has writ his Satyr in double and treble Rhymes too, but with this difference from <span class="hi">Butler,</span> that <span class="hi">Butler</span> makes use of them but sometimes, and <span class="hi">Tassone</span> does it perpetually. Nay the great <span class="hi">Tasso</span> has written his Heroick ▪Poem in them. I shall find another time to speak at large of the Gierusalemme: but this I can say at present, which is re­markably to the purpose, That some parts of that Poem are so far from being effeminate, that they have in­comparably more gravity than any <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e949"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=17">[Page]</a></span> long winded Poem which has been writ by the Moderns, if you only except some passages of the <span class="hi">Paradise lost of</span> Milton.</p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> himself in his own Satyrs has sometimes made use of double and treble Rhymes, ev'n in Heroick Verse. And in the Character of <span class="hi">Zimri,</span> which Mr. <span class="hi">Dryden</span> prefers to any part of <span class="hi">Absalom</span> and <span class="hi">Achitophel,</span> there are two couplets in the space of eight Lines, which are writ in double Rhymes, and those two coup­lets are two of the very best in all that admirable Character.</p><p>There is more than one considera­ble advantage that we have by our Burlesque Rhymes. For first, they show the power and plenty of the English Tongue. For neither <span class="hi">Italian</span> nor <span class="hi">French</span> have a sort of Rhymes for their Burlesque, which is different from those which they have for their other kinds of Verse. Nor <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e984"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=18">[Page]</a></span> have they in either of those Tongues any of those odd Rhymes, to the making up of which two or three words conspire. These Rhymes thus constituted (which is another advan­tage of our English Burlesque) seem to me to be as peculiarly becoming of a Jest, as a roguish Leer, or a co­mical tone of a Voice; and that it may plainly appear that this is no Whimsie, let the best Versifier in <span class="hi">England</span> turn these two Lines of <span class="hi">Butler.</span></p><div class="q"><div class="l">And Pulpet dr<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>m Ecclesiastick</div> <div class="l"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>as <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>eat with Fist instead of a Stick;</div></div><p>Let any one I say turn these two Lines into other Rhymes and other Measures, and I dare engage that the <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>est shall loose considerably.</p><p>Before I take my leave of Burlesque <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Butler,</span> I think fit to say something of the latter, which has not so direct a refe­rence <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1034"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=18">[Page]</a></span> to his way of writing (tho that too is indirectly commended by it) as to the incomparable genius of the Man. It is this that if any one would set the Common places of <span class="hi">Tassone</span> and <span class="hi"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>oi­leau</span>'s <span class="hi">Lutrin</span> against those of <span class="hi">Butler,</span> it would appear for the Honour of <span class="hi">England,</span> that neither the <span class="hi">French</span> man nor <span class="hi">Italian</span> could stand before us. The most diverting thing in all the <span class="hi">L<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>trin</span> is the Battle at <span class="hi">Barbin</span>'s Shop. <span class="hi">Chan<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>:</span> 5. Yet that, if it is compar'd with the Battle in the second Canto of the first part of <span class="hi">Hudibras,</span> tho it is so di­verting when we read it alone, will appear to be perfectly insipid.</p><p>Before I conclude I have two things to say farther. The one is, that the Verses to <span class="hi">Flavia</span> were writ by a Friend of mine and only Corrected by me, and it is by my friends leave that they are here inserted. The other thing is this, that tho I may expect to have this little Book se­verely <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1094"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=19">[Page]</a></span> examined, because I have attack'd several great men, who are all of them many degrees above me, yet I shall not at all repent of any thing I have writ by way of Criti­cism, if I do but in any measure ob­tain what I design'd by it, which was nothing but to advance Polite Learning amongst us. Not that I be­lieve my self capable of performing it, but I thought that the conside­ration of my impotency might ex­cite some generous spirits whom Na­ture and Education have capacitated for so noble a work. There is no man should be more glad to see it carried on than my self. I love my Country very well, and therefore should be ravished to see that we out did the <span class="hi">French</span> in Arts, at the same time that we contend for Empire with them.

following Speech.</span></h2><div class="opener"><div class="salute">SIR,</div></div><p>I Have here sent you inclos'd, what I pro­mis'd you by the last Post, and I think my self oblig'd to give you some account of it. In the late Appendix to the new <span class="hi">Ob­serva<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>or,</span> I find the Author reasonably com­plaining of the corruption of History by the <span class="hi">French,</span> and giving a very reasonable guess, how false the History of this Age (as far as it is writ by them) is like to come out in the next. And particularly what Mounsieur <span class="hi">Pelisson</span>'s History of the present King of <span class="hi">France</span> is like to be, which he is now writing by that King's own or­der. Monsieur <span class="hi">Boileau,</span> who writ the en­clos'd, has at least as great a share in that History as Monsieur <span class="hi">Pelisson:</span> And there­fore you have in the enclos'd, in the which he has very artfully inserted a Panegyrick <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3806"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=46">[Page 55]</a></span> of his Prince, a pattern of what his part of the History will be. For having flat­ter'd his Master in this small Panegyrick, we have all the reason in the world to believe That he will flatter him too in his History. And that he has flatter'd him here, you will plainly find; not only by exaggerati­ons, which are in some measure to be al­low'd to an Orator; but in affirming things which are directly contrary to the truth: Such are those two remarkable passages of the French King's offering Peace to the l<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e Confederacy, for the general good of <span class="hi">Chri­stendom,</span> (which not so much as a French­man who has common Sense, believes) and of his Bombarding <span class="hi">Genoa,</span> only to be re­veng'd of its Insolency and of its Perfidious­ness, which every man who has heard the Story of Mr. <span class="hi">Valdryon,</span> must laugh at. Now since it is to be presum'd, that Mon­sieur <span class="hi">Boileau</span> will flatter him in his History, because it is plain that he has flatter'd him in his Panegyrick; What are we to expect from Monsieur <span class="hi">Pelisson,</span> whose sincerity is by no means so much talk'd of as the other's? <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3845"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=47">[Page 56]</a></span> I thought to have concluded here: but it comes into my mind to make two reflecti­ons upon the Panegyrical part of the enclos'd. The first is this, that since Monsieur <span class="hi">Boileau,</span> who is in the main a man of sincerity, and a lover of truth; could not but flatter <span class="hi">Lewis</span> the Fourteenth when he commended him: we may conclude that it is impossible to give him a general commendation with­out flattery. For, where a Satyrick Poet paints what other man must not daub? The second Reflection is this, that since this Panegyrick is scarce to be supported, not­withstanding the most admirable genius of the Author, which shines throughout it; and an art to which nothing can be added (remember that I speak of the Original) and beyond which nothing can be desir'd; you may easily conclude how extreamly <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ulsome the rest of the Panegyricks upon <span class="hi">Lewis</span> the Fourteenth must needs be, whose Authors fall infinitely short of <span class="hi">Boileau</span>'s, ei­ther Genius, or Art, or Virtue.</p></div><div class="speech" id="index.xml-body.1_div.13"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3873"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=47">[Page 57]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">13. </span><span class="head">The Speech of Monsieur Boileau, up­on his admission into the French Academy.</span></h2><div class="opener"><div class="salute">Gentlemen,</div></div><p>THE Honour this day conferr'd upon me is some thing so great, so extraordina­ry, so little expected; and so many several sorts of reasons ought to have for ever excluded me from it, that at this very moment in which I return my acknowledgements, I am doubtful if I ought to believe it.

The goodness which the greatest Prince in the World has shown in employing me, together with one of the first of your illu­strious Writers, to make one Collection of the infinite number of his Immortal Actions; the permission which he has given me to do this, has supply'd all my defects with you.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3956"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=49">[Page 61]</a></span> Yes, Gentlemen, what ever just reasons ought to have excluded me for ever from your Academy; you believed that you could not with justice suffer, that a man who is destin'd to speak of such mighty things, should be depriv'd of the utility of your Lessons, or instructed in any other School than in yours. And by this, you have clearly shown, that when it is to serve your August Protector; whatever consideration might otherwise restrain you, your Zeal will not suffer you to cast your eyes upon any thing but the interest of your Master's Glory.</p><p>Yet suffer me, Gentlemen, to undeceive you, if you believe that that great Prince, at the time when he granted that favour to me, believ'd that he should meet within me a Writer, who was able to sustain in the least, by the Beauty of Style, or by the magnificent Pomp of Expression, the Grandeur of his Exploits. No, Gentlemen, it belongs to you, and to Pens like yours, to shew the World such Master-pieces; and he never conceiv'd so advantageous a <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3960"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=50">[Page 62]</a></span> thought of me.

class="opener"><div class="salute">SIR,</div></div><p>I Do not question but that you have for this month expected a Letter from me, and that perhaps with a little impatience: Since this is a time which may afford va­riety of News, of which who must not be now desirous? But all the time I was at <span class="hi">Paris,</span> I had so much Sickness, that that might well supersede any obligation I lay under. For let a promise be never so bind­ing, and never so much a Debt; who could take care of paying so trifling a one, when a most severe and importunate Cre­ditor, Nature, was calling for hers. Nor now when at length that excuse is want­ing to me, are you like to receive such a Let­ter, as perhaps might be most welcome to you in this Conjuncture. For if I should send you the truth in disguise, perhaps you might not discover her. And is this a time to expose her naked to the World: <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6415"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=82">[Page 126]</a></span> When her nakedness which is only the ef­fect of her Innocence, by many would be mistaken for Lewdness, and by more for Barbarity. I will then say nothing of the Affairs of <span class="hi">Europe</span> nor ours, tho I could find much to say of them both. For I now converse with a People who are as full of Talk as they are Inquisitive. But since I am taking my leave of that People, I will confine my Discourse to them. But be­fore I begin, I will use plain dealing with you, (a thing which they never did yet with any one) and tell you that I mortal­ly hate them. Yet neither shall my Na­tive nor acquir'd Antipathy suborn me to say any thing false of them. I will do like a Painter, who will draw the true resem­blance of the Face that is most provoking. But then I must give you this Caution, that what I have to say, tho it be true in some measure of all of them; yet it is chiefly to be consin'd to the middle so<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t of the Nation. For besides that I have most con­vers'd with them, as a Stranger must of necessity be suppos'd to do, the Genius <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6437"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=82">[Page 127]</a></span> of a Nation most plainly appears in the middle sort of its People. For great Education, which attends high Birth, or high Fortune, very often improves or corrupts or sophisticates Nature, whilst in those of the middle State she remains unmix<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d and unalter'd. These then I have found in the first place excessively vain. Every Man is here a <span class="hi">Narcissus,</span> and in the fl<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ttering glass of his own false imagination is eternally gazing up­on himself, or at least upon what he takes for himself. For in this their er­rours are different, for as that melan­choly Boy took himself for another, these merry Fools take something else for themselves. For nothing in Nature is more unlike than the Picture which a <span class="hi">Frenchman</span> draws of himself. It would be needless to insist longer on this. For they have so long made sport for their neighbouring Nations, by extra­vagant and absurd commendations of their own, that to endeavour to bring proofs of their Vanity, would be some­thing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6465"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=83">[Page 130]</a></span> more ridiculous than that. Now this is certain, that he who abounds in Vanity can want no affectation. For affectation is nothing but a fruitless at­tempt to counterfeit and falsi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ie Nature, when a Man impotently endeavours to appear what he really is not, or what he is incapable of being. Nature grows impatient, and struggles to be freed from the constraint that is put upon her, and in the strife there appear'd something so odious that all who are lovers of her, can­not but hate that person who endeavours so rudely to force her. Now Nature in man is various. She is Gay in one, and Froward in another: She is Delicate in a third, in a fourth she is Gross; and there is not a Man in a Million whom Heaven made fit for all things: yet how many are there, alas! who by senseless Self-love intoxicated, believe themselves sit for all things, and will be offering at all things. Now such have been al­ways, and will be always affected. And such are the people with whom I have <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6478"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=83">[Page 129]</a></span> lately convers'd; and I have more par­ticularly remark'd in some of their Pro­vincial Gentlemen, that in their endea­vours to shew their admiration mingled with a gentle Passion, they are guilty of affectations so monstrous, that an <span class="hi">Eng­lish Fop</span> is not capable of them. Ano­ther necessary effect of their vanity is their assurance, or in our Language, their Im­pudence. For modesty is nothing but the fear of displeasing, when a man believes or at least, suspects that he is defective; and it naturally includes in it a mistrust of our selves, and an esteem of others; which is the reason that renders it love­ly to all, when ever it is joyn'd with good qualities. For it flatters and sooths our Self-love, of which no Man can wholly divest himself; by assuring us that we are esteem'd and preferr'd. Now how can any one have this fear of displeasing, who imagines himself all Perfection, and who swell'd with the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6498"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=84">[Page 130]</a></span> venom of Pride, like the Toad in the Fable, believes himself greater than those with whose greatness he holds not the least proportion. The <span class="hi">French</span> then are affected and impudent, which are but the necessary effects of that Na­tional Vice, their Vanity. But then have they one very good quality, which pro­ceeds from the same vanity. And that is their extraordinary civility to Stran­gers. For they are civil to us, not for our satisfaction, but their own; not as they imagine it a duty, but an accom­plishment. 'Tis to please himself that a <span class="hi">Frenchman</span> is officious to me, and 'tis to honour himself that he bows to others. I am pretty confident that I am not de­ceiv'd here. For I have found by some observation, and some thinking, That there is little good Nature amongst them, For they will deceive or betray you at the very same time they oblige you. Thus have I giv'n you an imper­fect account of such of their qualities, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6520"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=84">[Page 131]</a></span> as are most conspicuous in them.

But as soon as we had conquer'd one half of it, the unusual heighth in which we found our selves, the impending Rock that hung over us, the dreadful Depth of the Precipice, and the Tor­rent that roar'd at the bottom, gave us such a view as was altogether new and amazing. On the other side of that Torrent, was a Mountain that equall'd ours, about the distance of thirty Yards from us. Its craggy Clifts▪ which we half discern'd, thro the misty gloom of the Clouds that surrounded them, sometimes gave us a horrid Prospect. And sometimes its face appear'd Smooth and Beautiful as the most even and fruitful Vallies. So different from themselves were the dif­ferent parts of it: In the very same place <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6613"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=86">[Page 134]</a></span> Nature was seen Severe and Wanton.

This Passage is a quarter of an English Mile, made with incredible labour, and the ex­pence of four Millions of Livers. At the Entrance into it is the following pompous Inscription.</p><div class="q"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6668"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=86">[Page 135]</a></span> Carolus Emanuel Secundus, Suband<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ae Dux, Pedemontani princeps, Cypri Rex, publicâ felicitate partâ, singulorum commodis in­tentus, breviorem, securioremque hanc viam regiam, a naturâ occlusam, Roma­nis intentatam, caeteris desperatam, eversis Scopulorum repagulis, aequalâ Montium in­iquitate, quae cervicibus impendebant prae­cipitia pedibus substernens, eternis popu­lorum Commerciis patefecit.</div><p>At <span class="hi">Chambery</span> we din'd, the Capital Town of <span class="hi">Savoy.</span> In our way from thence to <span class="hi">Mont­melian,</span> Nature seem'd quite to have changd her Face.

Here appear'd a Hill with its top quite hid in black Clouds, and beyond that Hill, &amp; a­bove those Clouds some higher Mountain show'd its hoary Head. With this strange entertainment by the way, we came that Night to <span class="hi">Montmelian.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6714"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=87">[Page 136]</a></span> On the 22. we set forward in the morn­ing. The Mountains appear'd to grow still more Lofty. We din'd that day at <span class="hi">Aigue­belle.</span> In the Afternoon we proceeded on our way, sometimes thro the Plain, and sometimes on the side of the <span class="hi">Alps;</span> with which we were hemm'd in on all sides. We then began th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t day to have the additional diversion, of a Torrent that ran sometimes with fury beneath us, and of the noise of the Cas­cades, or the down fall of Waters, which sometimes came tumbling a main from the Precipices. We lay that night at <span class="hi">La Chambre.</span></p><p>On the 23. The morning was very cold, which made us have dismal apprehensions of Mount <span class="hi">Cenis,</span> since we felt its influence so severely at so great a distance. We arriv'd by Noon at St. <span class="hi">Michel.</span> In the Afternoon we continued our Journey mostly upon the sides of the Mountains, which were some­times all cover'd with Pines; and sometimes cultivated, ev'n in places where one would swear the thing were impossible, for they were only not perpendicular. We lay that <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ight at <span class="hi">Modane.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6756"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=87">[Page 137]</a></span> <span class="hi">Oct. 24. Modane</span> is within a dozen Miles of Mount <span class="hi">Cenis,</span> and therefore the next morning we felt the Cold more severely. We went to Dinner at <span class="hi">Laneburgh,</span> situate at the foot of Mount <span class="hi">Cenis.</span></p><p>As soon as we had din'd, we sent our Horses about, and getting up upon Mules began to ascend the Mountain. I could not forbear looking back now and then to contemplate the Town and the Vale be­neath me. When I was arriv'd within a hundred Yards of the Top, I could still discern <span class="hi">Laneburgh</span> at the Bottom, distant Three tedious Miles from me. What an amazing distance? Think what an impres­sion a place must make upon you, which you should see as far under you as 'tis from your House to <span class="hi">Hampstead.</span> And here I wish I had force to do <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ight to this re­nown'd Passage of the <span class="hi">Alpes.</span> 'Tis an easie thing to describe <span class="hi">Rome</span> or <span class="hi">Naples</span> to you, because you have seen something your self that holds at least some resemblance with them; but impossible to set a Mountain before your eyes, that is inaccessible al­most <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6800"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=88">[Page 138]</a></span> to the fight, and wearies the very Eye to Climb it. For when I tell you that we were arriv'd within a hundred yards of the Top: I mean only the Plain, thro which we afterwards pass'd, but there is another vast Mountain still upon that. If these Hills were first made with the World, as has been a long time thought, and Nature design'd them only as a Mound to inclose her Garden <span class="hi">Italy:</span> Then we may well say of her what some affirm of great Wits, that her, careless irregular and boldest Strokes are most admirable. For the <span class="hi">Alpes</span> are works which she seems to have design'd, and executed too in Fury. Yet she moves us less, where she studies to please us more. I am delighted, 'tis true at the prospect of Hills and Valleys, of flowry Meads, and murmuring Streams, yet it is a delight that is consistent with Reason, a delight that creates or im­proves Meditation. But transporting Pleasures follow'd the sight of the <span class="hi">Alpes,</span> and what unusual transports think you were those, that were mingled with horrours, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6814"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=88">[Page 139]</a></span> and sometimes almost with despair? But if these Mountains were not a Creation, but form'd by universal Destruction, when the Arch with a mighty flaw dissolv'd and fell into the vast Abyss (which surely is the best opinion) then are these Ruines of the old World the greatest wonders of the New. For they are not only vast, but horrid, hideous, ghastly Ruins. After we had gallop'd a League over the Plain, and came at last to descend, to descend thro the very Bowels as it were of the Mountain, for we seem'd to be enclos'd on all sides: What an astonishing Pros­pect was there? Ruins upon Ruins in mon­strous Heaps, and Heaven and Earth con­founded. The uncouth Rocks that were above us, Rocks that were void of all form, but what they had receiv'd from Ruine; the frightful view of the Preci­pices, and the foaming Waters that threw themselves headlong down them, made all such a Consort up for the Eye, as that sort of Musick does for the Ear, in which Horrour can be joyn'd with Har­mony. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6827"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=89">[Page 140]</a></span> I am afraid you will think that I have said too much. Yet if you had but seen what I have done, you would surely think that I have said too little. However Hyperboles might easily here be forgiven. The <span class="hi">Alpes</span> appear to be Nature's extra­vagancies, and who should blush to be guilty of Extravagancies, in words that make mention of her's. But 'tis time to proceed. We descended in Chairs, the descent was four English Miles. We past thro <span class="hi">Novalese,</span> situate at the Foot of Mount <span class="hi">Cenis</span> on the side of <span class="hi">Italy,</span> and lay that Night at <span class="hi">Suse.</span> We din'd the next day at <span class="hi">Villane,</span> and thro a pleasant Valley came that Night to this place.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">I am, &amp;c.</div></div></div><div class="letter" id="index.xml-body.1_div.33"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6856"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=89">[Page 141]</a></div><h2><span class="headingNumber">33. </span><span class="head">Rome Decemb. 1. 1688.</span></h2><p>TO perform the promise which I made you in my last, I venture to say something of the Ancient and Modern <span class="hi">Italians,</span> tho you do not con­sider that when you made that request to me, you put me upon a necessity of disobliging my Friend by a refusal, or exposing my self by treating of a Subject for which I am wholly unqualified. It is true, when I was at <span class="hi">Lyons</span> in compliance with your desire, I ventur'd to say something of the <span class="hi">French.</span> But besides that I had been longer in <span class="hi">France</span> than I have in <span class="hi">Italy,</span> the <span class="hi">French</span> lye so open, that a Man who will observe them, may as well venture to give their Character in a Months time, as he may in several years. For they who are ex­cessivly vain, take as much pains to show them­selves, as a Stroler at a Fair does a Monster. 'Tis the constant business of their Lives to paint out their Virtues to you; nay, and their Defects which their Vanity mistakes for their Virtues. But the <span class="hi">Italians</span> are as reserv'd to Strangers as the <span class="hi">French</span> are open: and one would wonder how they who show much Flegm before they are very well ac­quainted, should be able afterwards, in so strange a manner, to animate Conversation. But to come to my business, 'tis wonderful you say, that the Modern <span class="hi">Italians</span> should appear so different from the Ancient, since they breath the same Air, and are nourish'd by the same Soil. For since the affinity <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6898"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=90">[Page 142]</a></span> is so near betwixt the Soul and the Body, and they work so strongly upon each other, you say it is but reasonable to believe that the Climate which helps to give the Body its Complexion, should help to give the Mind its Temper. Now since you have reason, you say, to suppose that the Climate of <span class="hi">Italy</span> is very near the same at this day, that it was two Thousand Years agoe, you cannot but wonder that the Modern <span class="hi">Italians</span> should appear so different from the Ancient. The <span class="hi">French</span> are the very same now that <span class="hi">Caesar</span> described them formerly, excepting that they are grown a more polish'd sort of Barbarians. The <span class="hi">Carthaginians</span> were fam'd for their Cruelty &amp; their Perfidiousness; and those two Vices are at present, inseparable from the Inhabitants of the Coasts of <span class="hi">Barbary.</span> But the <span class="hi">Italians,</span> you say, are at present renown'd for several extraordinary Vices, which w<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>re utterly unknown to the Ancient <span class="hi">Romans,</span> to whose Virtues the Modern are utterly Strangers.</p><p>In answer to this, give me leave to tell you that you are mistaken in part of your Assertion. For the Vices which are to be found at this day in <span class="hi">Italy,</span> were the Vices of the Ancient <span class="hi">Romans.</span> Their Empire ow'd its Rise to the same Crimes which dissolv'd it, and there were proportionably as many Villains in the <span class="hi">Rome</span> of <span class="hi">Romulus,</span> as there are in that of <span class="hi">Innocent</span> the Eleventh. Consider the Factions of <span class="hi">Marius</span> and <span class="hi">Sylla,</span> and the two Triumvi­rats following, and you will find infinitely more ex­amples of black Revenge than you can amongst Modern <span class="hi">Italians.</span> What can be more bloody than <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6960"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=90">[Page 143]</a></span> those times? Or more treache<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ous and base than those of <span class="hi">Tiberius?</span> 'Tis true from the time of the first Consuls, to the end of the <span class="hi">Punick War,</span> there flourish'd a continual Race of Heroes, with whom if you compare the Modern <span class="hi">Italians,</span> they seem to be Men of quite different frames, and Inhabitants of a different part of the World. A capacity to practise those glittering Virtues which the World so much admires, depends very much upon force of mind, which depends in some sort on the Com­plexion, as that does in some sort on the Climate. But then is it certain that there is the very same force of mind requir'd to be prodigiously wicked, that is required to be heroically Virtuous. Weak people are but wicked by halves, but whenever we hear of high and enormous Crimes, we may conclude, that they proceed from a power of Soul and a reach of Thought, which are altogether extraordinary. So that the Modern <span class="hi">Italians,</span> who by your own confession are skill'd in all the ways of exquisite wickedness, come into the World with as much natural capacity to exer<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> he­roick Virtue, as ever the Ancient <span class="hi">Romans</span> did.</p><p>Force of Mind makes a Man capable of great Vir­tues, or of great Vices; but it determines him to neither. Education, Discipline and Accidents of Life constitute him either a great Philosopher, or an illustrious Libertine.</p><p>As strongest bodies cannot be secure from Infe­ction in pestilential Seasons, so Minds that have most force are apt to be tainted by the Contagion of Epidemick Vices.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7001"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=91">[Page 144]</a></span> The two most glittering Virtues that shin'd a­mongst the ancient <span class="hi">Romans,</span> were greatness of Mind and heroick Fortitude: 'Twas that greatness of Mind that made one of their Generals reject with disdain, the offer that was made him to poy­son the most formidable Enemy to their State: whereas the modern <span class="hi">Italians</span> have at every turn recourse to Stilletto and Poyson, which are almost their only offensive Weapons.</p><p>Do but compare the happy and flourishing state of the old Commonwealth, with the wretched con­dition of the modern <span class="hi">Italians,</span> and you will soon find the reason why the <span class="hi">Romans</span> were Brave and Honourable Enemies; and why the <span class="hi">Italians</span> at pre­sent are base ones. For this is most certain, That no Man can basely offer violence to another without doing some to himself. From whence it follows that no Man will do it, unless in some measure he believes it necessary. No Man then will take a base revenge of another who believes that he can take an honourable one. No Man will ever have recourse to Treachery who is confident of prevailing by open force. Now great success most commonly in­fuses great Thoughts, and inspires a noble Presump­tion▪ which renders Men Brave and Magnanimous: whereas we frequently see that Men with their Fortunes and Liberties lose their very Spirits and Souls, according to the observation of the Comick Poet. <span class="hi">Vt res nostrae sint, ita nos magni <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>tque humi­les sumns.</span></p><div class="trailer">FINIS.</div><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e7047"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=65590&amp;page=91">[Page]</a></div></div><!--TEI back--><!--Notes in [TEI]--><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">* </span><div class="noteBody"><span class="hi">Boileau,</span> when he writ this, was about Six and Forty Years Old; but P<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>etry admits of no edd Numbers above Nine.</div></div></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Dennis, John, 1657-1734..
