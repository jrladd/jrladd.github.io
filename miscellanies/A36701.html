I humbly take the boldness to commit them to the Security which your name and protection will give them with the most knowing part of the world. There are two things especially in which they stand in need of your defence. One is, that they fall so infinitely below the full and lofty Genius of that excellent Poet, who made this way of writing free of our Nation: The other, that they are so little proportion'd and equal to the renown of that Prince on whom they were written. Such great Actions and Lives deserving rather to be the Subjects of the Noblest Pens and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e846"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=50677&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> most Divine Phansies, than of such small beginners and weak essayers in Poetry, as my self. Against these dangeÂ­rous Prejudices, there remains no other shield than the uniÂ­versal Esteem and Authority, which your judgment and apÂ­probation carries with it. The right you have to them, Sir, is not only upon the account of the Relation you had to this great Personâ–ª nor of the General favour which all Arts reÂ­ceive from you; but more peculiarly by reason of that obliÂ­gation and zeal with which I am bound to dedicate my self to your service. For, having been a long time the object of your care and Indulgence towards the advantage of my studies and fortune, having been moulded, (as it were) by your own hands, and form'd under your Government; not to inÂ­title you to any thing which my meaness produces, would not only be injustice, but sacrilege. So that if there be any thing here tolerably said, and which deserves Pardon, it is yours, Sir, as well as he, who is</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your most Devoted and Obliged
