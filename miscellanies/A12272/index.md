## 1\. The two Loving Siſters:

Wherein the one to the other doth ſhew,

How Cupid in a Dreame did her wooe.

To a pleaſant new Tune.

_[figure]_

IT was my chance not long agoe,

abroad as I was walking,

I heard two louing Siſters,

that ſecretly were talking;

The youngeſt to the eldeſt ſaid,

why doeſt thou not marry?

In faith (quoth ſhe) Ile tell to thée,

I meane not long to farry.

When I was fiftéene yéeres of age,

then had I ſuiters many,

But like a wanton wily wench,

I would not ſport with any:

Till at the laſt, ſléeping faſt,

Cupid came vnto me,

And like a Lad that had béene mad,

he ſwore that he would woo me.

Then he lay downe by my ſide,

and laid his armes vpon me:

But I being 'twixt ſléepe and wake,

did ſtriue to thruſt him from me.

But then he ſo kiſſed me,

as I was kiſſed neuer;

If he had ne're left kiſſing me,

I ſhould haue ſlept for euer.

Then he hug'd and tug'd me ſo,

I could not get him from me,

But I with all the ſtrength I had,

did thruſt him who came on me:

For Cupid like a Suiter bold,

did uſe both time and leaſure,

And in the circle of his armes,

enchanted me with pleaſure.

Then me thought the world run round,

when Phoebus fell a skipping,

And all the Nymphs and Goddeſſes,

came round about to ſtrip him,

Neptune lowred, & would have powred

his Ocean cup upon us,

But Boreas with his bluſtring blaſt,

did ſtrive to thruſt him from us.

Then limping Vulcan he came in,

like one that had béene iealous;

Venus follow'd after him,

and ſwore ſhe'd blow the bellowes.

Mars call'd Cupid Iackanapes,

and ſwore he would him ſmother;

Quoth Cupid then, did I ſay ſo,

when thou didſt love my Mother?

Me thought that Orphaeus with his Lute

ſtood at my bed ſide playing,

And Pan too with his oaten Flute,

did kéepe his Flocke from ſtraying:

And while that they did ſweetly play,

in ſuch a trance they laid me,

That to the pleaſant Fields below,

I thought they had convey'd me.

Then Iuno and great Iupiter,

came marching with Apollo,

Saturne came with Mercury,

and all began to hollow:

Cupid ran and hid himſelfe,

and ſo of ioyes bereft me:

Then ſuddenly I did awake,

and all theſe fancies left me.

### 1.1. The ſecond part. To the ſame Tune.

_[figure]_

WEll Siſter, I have heard your dreame,

which much good doth intend thée:

For I thinke Cupid now doth meane,

with a husband to befriend thée;

And to entice you unto love,

which you held in deriſion,

Hath ſent you this ſame Dreame, which may

be called Pleaſures Viſion.

Then Siſter, I would have thée uſe

thy Suiters well hereafter:

And though our Father he be rich,

and thou his eldeſt Daughter,

Yet I doe know you are in love,

for 'tis in vaine to hide it:

O fie on this diſſembling looke,

I never could abide it.

Make uſe of time, it will away,

for beauty ſoone decayeth,

And ſhée is out of date, they ſay,

that untill twenty ſtayeth.

Then let us not be coy againe,

theſe ſquemiſh trickes undoe us,

But kindly let us entertaine,

our Suiters when they wooe us▪

This péeviſhneſſe doth but prolong,

our Maiden griefe and ſorrow;

And we are older by a day,

when wée doe riſe to morrow:

Then why ſhould we in modeſty,

our owne deſires thus ſmother,

Faith I doe love a proper man,

and ſo too did my Mother.

Cupid is a waggiſh Boy,

and by your dreame he ſhewed,

That married couples happy be,

that are with love indewed;

But ſhe that dyeth here a Maid,

and coyly doth diſſemble,

Shall afterward lead Apes about,

which makes my heart to tremble.

Although that I doe counſell you,

who are my eldeſt Siſter;

Yet if my tongue belye my heart,

I wiſh that it may bliſter:

For I confeſſe, that when I firſt

to fiftéene yéeres attained,

To thinke that I had ſtaid ſo long,

I oftentimes complained.

The eldeſt Siſter hearing this,

unto her ſoone replyed;

Good Siſter, I your counſell like,

which ſhall not be denyed,

For though that I have alwayes béene

ſo coy in outward carriage,

Yet being eldeſt, as 'tis fit,

I will take place in marriage,

The other Siſter then replyed,

quoth ſhe, though I am younger,

Yet will I not in love give place,

for my deſires are ſtronger:

And therefore ſince that both of us,

againſt our wills have tarried,

Like loving Siſters let us both,

upon one day be married.

FINIS.
