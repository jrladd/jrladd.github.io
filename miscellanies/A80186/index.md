## 1\. Colonel John Okie's LAMENTATION, OR A RUMPER CASHIERED.

To the tune of, And a Begging we will go.

OF a Famous Brewer my purpoſe is to tell,

Now mighty Roaring Oliver and Pride are gone to Hell,

The Noble Stoker Okey that doth the reſt Excel,

And give him more Ale and Grains:

The Rumps great Champion, the defender of the State,

The Commonwealths Sir Guy o'recome by cunning Fate,

Packing out of England, with the Divels Exciſe Rate,

And give, &c.

And I (quoth this John) muſt now bring up the Rear,

And Tally the Account of our State Stinking Beer,

I wiſh I had my complices again to help me here,

And give, &c.

My Trade hath had the Honour, the State to overturn,

How often times did I, and Pride the Houſe Adjourn?

I know I muſt be hang'd for I'm too Wett to Burn,

And give, &c.

Yet when I think how ſlighly, my partners me forſooke,

And never put the totall Summe to Bible nor to Book,

I wiſh the Div'l for comp'ny had Okey alſo took,

And give, &c.

Then had I ſpar'd my angry Corking Knife,

Which I drew at th' Exchange againſt a Hawkers Wife,

For crying againſt the Rump end, our gainful ſtrife,

And give, &c.

They ſay I am indited, for Secluding of the Members,

One thouſand ſix hundred forty eight in December,

Would the Inditement was rak't in my Stoake hole Embers,

And give him, &c.

My ſtrong Irons beaten into broad Swords and Spears,

My thick Smoke did vaniſh into Jealouſies and Fears,

But now all my waſh is limbeckt into Tears,

And give him, &c.

A Fat Tub-woman was my Goddeſſe great of War,

My Hoſteſſe by Bellona that lived at the Starr,

No matter if to Tyburn, I ride in Dray or Carr,

And give him, &c.

But my Dray is transformd to An Ammunition Wagon,

My Horſes ſwopt for light Nags, for ſervice of the Dragoon,

With which I overtooke the Welch, when they came from St. Fagon,

And give him, &c.

My brazen impudence, now leaves me at my Copper,

And that will go ere long, then I'le be bottle ſtopper,

And then Sepulchres Bell, O how I fear that Clapper,

And give him, &c.

Adieu then all my Vailes, my Tilts, my Dregs and Yeſt,

A Rump, and a Free State, ſhield me from an Inqueſt,

I am not bound for Portſmouth but Tyburn in the Weſt.

And give him, &c.

I'le now betake my ſelf again unto the old Maſh Tun,

And with my Brewing Oares, I'le Row to Wimbleton,

I Murdered Charls the Father, I may'nt endure the Son,

And give him, &c.

My old guile will be beſt, now I am ſtricken out 'oth Role,

I'le Cunningly retreat again into my warm Stoke Hole,

Sir Arthur is to find me ſtore of Newcaſtle Cole.

And give him more Ale and Grains.
