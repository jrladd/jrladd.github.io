This being ſo, remember, That next to the danger, of <span class="hi">committing</span> the Fault your ſelf, the greateſt is that of <span class="hi">ſeeing</span> it in your <span class="hi">Husband.</span> Do not ſeem to look or hear that way: If he is a Man of Senſe, he will re­claim himſelf; the Folly of it, is of it ſelf ſufficient to cure him: if he is not ſo, he will be provok'd, but not reform'd. To expoſtulate in theſe Caſes, looketh like declaring War, and preparing Repriſals; which to a <span class="hi">thinking Husband</span> would be a dangerous Reflexion. Beſides, it is ſo courſe a Reaſon which will be aſſign'd for a Lady's too great Warmth upon ſuch an occaſion, that Modeſty no leſs than Prudence ought to reſtrain her; ſince ſuch an undecent Complaint makes a Wife much more ridi­culous, than the Injury that provoketh her to it.

The Imperti­nence of ſuch Methods is ſo plain, that it doth not deſerve the pains of being laid open.

There­fore that which may generally be call'd <span class="hi">Ill-Humour,</span> is not always a Fault; it be­cometh one when either it is wrong ap­plied, or that it is continued too long, when it is not ſo: For this Reaſon you muſt not too haſtily fix an ill name upon that which may perhaps not deſerve it; and though the Caſe ſhould be, that your <span class="hi">Husband</span> might too ſowerly reſent any thing he diſliketh, it may ſo happen, that more Blame ſhall belong to your <span class="hi">Miſtake,</span> than to his <span class="hi">Ill-Humour.</span> If a <span class="hi">Husband</span> be­haveth himſelf ſometimes with an <span class="hi">Indiffe­rence</span> that a <span class="hi">Wife</span> may think offenſive, ſhe is in the wrong to put the worſt ſence upon it, if by any Means it will admit a better. Some <span class="hi">Wives</span> will call it <span class="hi">Ill-humour</span> if their Husbands change their <span class="hi">Style</span> from that which they uſed whilſt they made their firſt Addreſſes to them: Others will allow no <span class="hi">Intermiſſion</span> or <span class="hi">Abatement</span> in the Expreſſions of Kindneſs to them, not enough diſtinguiſhing Times, and forget­ting that it is impoſſible for Men to keep themſelves up all their Lives to the height <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3894"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=26">[Page 26]</a></span> of ſome <span class="hi">extravagant Moments.</span> A Man may at ſome times be leſs careful in little things, without any cold or diſobliging Reaſon for it; as a <span class="hi">Wife</span> may be too ex­pecting in ſmaller matters, without draw­ing upon her-ſelf the inference of being <span class="hi">unkind.</span> And if your <span class="hi">Husband</span> ſhould be really ſullen, and have ſuch frequent Fits, as might take away the excuſe of it, it concerneth you to have an Eye prepared to diſcern the firſt Appearances of Cloudy Weather, and to watch when the Fit go­eth off, which ſeldom laſteth long if it is let alone. But whilſt the Mind is ſore, eve­ry thing galleth it, and that maketh it neceſſary to let the <span class="hi">Black Humour</span> begin to ſpend it ſelf▪ before you come in and ven­ture to undertake it.</p><p>If in the Lottery of the World you ſhould draw a <span class="hi">Covetous Husband,</span> I confeſs it will not make you proud of your <span class="hi">good Luck;</span> yet even ſuch a one may be en­dured too, though there are few Paſſions more untractable than that of <span class="hi">Avarice.</span> You muſt firſt take care that your <span class="hi">Defini­tion</span> of <span class="hi">Avarice</span> may not be a Miſtake. You are to examine every Circumſtance of your <span class="hi">Husband</span>'s Fortune, and weigh the Reaſon of every thing you expect from him before you have right to pro­nounce <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3953"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=26">[Page 27]</a></span> that ſentence. The Complaint is now ſo general againſt all <span class="hi">Husbands,</span> that it giveth great ſuſpicion of its being often ill-grounded; it is impoſſible they ſhould all deſerve that Cenſure, and therefore it is certain, that it is many times miſap­plied. He that <span class="hi">ſpareth</span> in every thing is an <span class="hi">inexcuſable Niggard;</span> he that <span class="hi">ſpareth</span> in nothing is as <span class="hi">inexcuſable a Madman.</span> The <span class="hi">mean</span> is, to ſpare in what is leaſt neceſſa­ry, to lay out more liberally in what is moſt required in our ſeveral circumſtances. Yet this will not always ſatisfie. There are <span class="hi">Wives</span> who are impatient of the Rules of Oecomomy, and are apt to call their <span class="hi">Husband</span>'s Kindneſs in queſtion, if any other meaſure is put to their expence than that of their own Fancy. Be ſure to avoid this dangerous Error, ſuch a partiality to your Self▪ which is ſo offenſive to an un­derſtanding Man, that he will very ill bear a <span class="hi">Wife</span>'s giving her ſelf ſuch an injurious <span class="hi">preference</span> to all the <span class="hi">Family,</span> and whatever belongeth to it.</p><p>But to admit the worſt, and that your <span class="hi">Husband</span> is really a <span class="hi">Cloſe-handed Wretch,</span> you muſt in this, as in other Caſes, endea­vour to make it leſs afflicting to you; and firſt you muſt obſerve <span class="hi">ſeaſonable hours</span> of ſpeaking. When you offer any thing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4013"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=27">[Page 28]</a></span> in oppoſition to this reigning Humour, a <span class="hi">third hand</span> and a <span class="hi">wiſe Friend,</span> may often prevail more than you will be allowed to do in your own Cauſe. Sometimes you are dexterouſly to go along with him in things, where you ſee that the niggardly part of his Mind is moſt predominant, by which you will have the better opportunity of perſwading him in things where he may be more indifferent. Our <span class="hi">Paſſions</span> are very unequal, and are apt to be raiſed or leſſen­ed, according as they work upon different Objects; they are not to be <span class="hi">ſtopped</span> or <span class="hi">re­ſtrained</span> in thoſe things where our Mind is more particularly engaged. In other mat­ters they are more tractable, and will ſome­times give Reaſon a hearing, and admit a fair Diſpute. More than that, there are few Men, even in this inſtance of <span class="hi">Ava<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ice,</span> ſo intirely abandoned to it, that at ſome hours, and upon ſome occaſions, will not for­get their natures, and for that time turn Pro­digal. The ſame Man who will <span class="hi">grudge</span> him­ſelf what is <span class="hi">neceſſary,</span> let his <span class="hi">Pride</span> be raiſed and he ſhall be <span class="hi">profuſe;</span> at another time his <span class="hi">Anger</span> ſhall have the ſame effect; a fit of <span class="hi">Vanity, Ambition,</span> and ſometimes of <span class="hi">Kind­neſs,</span> ſhall open and inlarge his <span class="hi">narrow Mind;</span> a Doſe of Wine will work upon this tough humor, and for the time diſſolve it.

To make ſuch a <span class="hi">Misfortune</span> leſs hea­vy you are firſt to bring to your Ob­ſervation, That a <span class="hi">Wife</span> very often maketh better Figure, for her <span class="hi">Husband</span>'s making no great one: And there ſeemeth to be lit­tle reaſon, why the ſame <span class="hi">Lady</span> that chuſeth a <span class="hi">Waiting-Woman</span> with <span class="hi">worſe Looks,</span> may not be content with a <span class="hi">Huſband</span> with <span class="hi">leſs Wit;</span> the Argument being equal from the advantage of the Compariſon. If you will <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4158"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=28">[Page 30]</a></span> be more aſhamed in ſome Caſes, of ſuch a <span class="hi">Husband,</span> you will be leſs afraid than you would perhaps be of a wiſe one. His <span class="hi">Vnſeaſonable Weakneſs</span> may no doubt ſometimes grieve you, but then ſet againſt this, that it giveth you the <span class="hi">Dominion,</span> i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> you will make the right uſe of it. It is next to his being dead, in which Caſe the <span class="hi">Wife</span> hath right to Adminiſter; therefore be ſure, if you have ſuch an Idiot, that none, except your ſelf, may have the benefit of the forfeiture; Such a Fool is a dangerous Beaſt, if others have the keep­ing of him; and you muſt be very undex­terous if when your <span class="hi">Husband</span> ſhall reſolve to be an <span class="hi">Aſs,</span> you do not take care he may be <span class="hi">your Aſs.</span> But you muſt go skil­fully about it and above all things, take heed of diſtinguiſhing in publick, what kind of <span class="hi">Husband</span> he is: Your inward thoughts muſt not hinder the outward payment of the conſideration that is due to him: Your <span class="hi">ſlighting</span> him in <span class="hi">Company,</span> beſides that it would, to a diſcerning By ſtander, give too great encouragement for the making nearer applications to you, is in it ſelf ſuch an undecent way of aſſuming, that it may provoke the tame Creature to break looſe, and to ſhew his <span class="hi">Dominion</span> for his Credit, which he was content to forget for his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4206"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=28">[Page 31]</a></span> Eaſe.

Such a <span class="hi">Husband</span> is as much a­bove all the other Kinds of them, as a <span class="hi">rational ſubjection</span> to a Prince, great in him­ſelf, is to be preferr'd before the diſquiet and uneaſineſs of <span class="hi">Vnlimited Liberty.</span></p><p>Before I leave this Head, I muſt add a little concerning your <span class="hi">Behaviour</span> to your <span class="hi">Husband's Friends,</span> which requireth the moſt refined part of your Underſtanding to acquit your ſelf well of it.

And that you may with leſs difficulty afterwards give your Directions, be ſure at firſt to re­ceive them from your <span class="hi">Husband</span>'s Friends. Gain them to you by early applying to them, and they will be ſo ſatisfied, that as nothing is more thankful than Pride, when it is complied with, they will ſtrive which of them ſhall moſt recommend you; and when they have helped you to take Root in your <span class="hi">Husband</span>'s good Opinion, you will have leſs dependence upon theirs, though you muſt not neglect any reaſonable means of preſerving it. You are to conſider, that a Man govern'd by his <span class="hi">Friends,</span> is ve­ry eaſily inflamed by them; and that one who is not ſo, will yet for his own ſake expect to have them conſider'd. It is eaſily improved to a point of Honour in a <span class="hi">Hus­band,</span> not to have his <span class="hi">Relations</span> neglected; and nothing is more dangerous, than to raiſe an Objection, which is grounded up­on <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4297"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=29">[Page 33]</a></span> <span class="hi">Pride:</span> It is the moſt ſtubborn and laſt­ing Paſſion we are ſubject to, and where it is the firſt cauſe of the <span class="hi">War,</span> it is very hard to make a ſecure <span class="hi">Peace.</span> Your <span class="hi">Cauti­on</span> in this is of the laſt importance to you.</p><p>And that you may the better ſucceed in it, carry a ſtrict Eye upon the <span class="hi">Impertinence</span> of your <span class="hi">Servants;</span> take heed that their <span class="hi">Ill-humour</span> may not engage you to take Ex­ceptions, or their too much aſſuming i<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> ſmall matters, raiſe Conſequences which may bring you under great Diſadvantage.

There are Times and Periods fix'd for both; and when they are too long neglected, the Puniſhment is, that they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4665"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=32">[Page 39]</a></span> are <span class="hi">Irrecoverable,</span> and nothing remaineth but an uſeleſs <span class="hi">Grief</span> for the Folly of hav­ing thrown them out of our power. You are to think what a mean Figure a Wo­man maketh, when ſhe is ſo degraded by her own Fault; whereas there is no­thing in thoſe Duties which are expected from you, that can be a leſſening to you, except your want of <span class="hi">Conduct</span> makes it ſo. You may love your <span class="hi">Children</span> without liv­ing in the <span class="hi">Nurſery,</span> and you may have a <span class="hi">competent</span> and <span class="hi">diſcreet care</span> of them, with out letting it▪ break out upon the Compa­ny, or expoſing your ſelf by turning your Diſcourſe that way, which is a kind of <span class="hi">Laying Children</span> to the <span class="hi">Pariſh,</span> and it can hardly be done any where, that thoſe who hear it will be ſo forgiving, as not to think they are overcharged with them. A Woman's <span class="hi">tenderneſs</span> to her <span class="hi">Chil­dren</span> is one of the leaſt deceitful Evidences of the Vertue; but yet the way of ex­preſſing it, muſt be ſubject to the Rules of <span class="hi">good Breeding:</span> And though a <span class="hi">Woman</span> of <span class="hi">Quality</span> ought not to be leſs kind to them, than <span class="hi">Mothers</span> of the <span class="hi">Meaneſt Rank</span> are to theirs, yet ſhe may diſtinguiſh her ſelf in the <span class="hi">manner,</span> and avoid the courſe Methods, which in Women of a lower ſize might be more excuſable.

This Mixture is no where more neceſſary than in Children.

I do not know whether this Figure did not make us as great as our former Conqueſt, to be a perpetual Um­pire of two great contending Powers, who gave us all their Courtſhip, and offer'd all their Incenſe at our Altar, whilſt the Fate of either Prince ſeemed to depend upon the Oracles we delivered; for the King of <span class="hi">England</span> to ſit on his Throne, as in the Su­pream Court of Juſtice, to which the two great Monarchs appeal, pleading their Cauſe, and expecting their Sentence▪ declaring which ſide was in the right, or at leaſt if we pleas'd which ſide ſhould have the bet­ter of it, was a piece of Greatneſs which was peculiar to us, and no wonder if we endeavour to preſerve it, as we did for a conſiderable time, it being our Safety, as well as Glory, to maintain it; but by a Fatality upon our Councils, or by the re­fin'd Policy of this latter Age, we have thought fit to uſe induſtry to deſtroy this mighty Power, which we have ſo long en­joyed; and that equality between the Two Monarchs, which we might for ever have preſerved, has been chiefly broken by us, whoſe Intereſt it was above all others to maintain it; when one of them, like the overflowing of the Sea, had gained more upon the other than our convenience, or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9751"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=93">[Page 70]</a></span> indeed our ſafety, would allow; inſtead of mending the Banks, or making new ones, we our ſelves with our own hands helpt to cut them, to invite and make way for a farther Inundation. <span class="hi">France</span> and <span class="hi">Spain</span> have had their ſeveral turns in making uſe of our Miſtakes, and we have been formerly as deaf to the Inſtances of the then weaker part of the World to help them againſt the Houſe of <span class="hi">Auſtria,</span> as we can now be to the Earneſt­neſs of <span class="hi">Spain,</span> that we would aſſiſt them againſt the Power of <span class="hi">France.

Such a Me­thod was natural enough to an Uſurper, and ſhew'd he was not the Lawful Father of the People, by his having ſo little care of them; and the Example coming from that hand, one would think ſhould, for that Reaſon, be leſs likely to be follow'd. But to go on, home comes the King, fol­lowed with Courtſhips from all Nations abroad, of which ſome did it not only to make them forget how familiarly they had us'd him when he was in other Circum­ſtances, but to beſpeak the Friendſhip of a Prince, who beſides his other Greatneſs, was yet more conſiderable by being re-eſta­bliſhed by the love of his people. <span class="hi">France</span> had an Intereſt either to diſpoſe us to ſo much good will, or at leaſt to put us into ſuch a Condition, that we might give no Oppoſition to their Deſigns; and <span class="hi">Flanders</span> being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a laſting Beauty for which they have an in­curable paſſion, and not being kind enough to conſent to them, they meditated to commit a Rape upon her, which they thought would not be eaſie to do, while <span class="hi">England</span> and <span class="hi">Holland</span> were agreed to reſcue her, when-ever they ſhould hear her cry out for help to them; to this end they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9820"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=94">[Page 72]</a></span> put in practice Seaſonable and Artificial Whiſpers, to widen things between us, and the States. <span class="hi">Amboyna</span> and the Fiſhery muſt be talk'd of here; the freedom of the Seas, and the preſervation of Track muſt be inſinuated there; and there being combuſtible matter on both ſides, in <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> little time it took Fire, which gave thoſe that kindled it, ſufficient cauſe to ſmile and hug themſelves, to ſee us both fall into the Net they had laid for us.

Amongſt the other means uſed for the attaining this end, the ſending over the Dutcheſs of <span class="hi">Orleans,</span> was not the leaſt pow­erful; ſhe was a very welcome Gueſt here, and her own Charms and Dexterity joined with other Advantages, that might help her perſwaſions, gave her ſuch an Aſcendant, that ſhe ſhould hardly fail of ſucceſs. One of the Preliminaries of her Treaty, tho a trivial thing in it ſelf, yet was conſidera­ble in the Conſequence, as very ſmall cir­cumſtances <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9909"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=95">[Page 74]</a></span> often are in relation to the Go­vernment of the World. About this time a general Humour, in oppoſition to <span class="hi">France,</span> had made us throw off their Faſhion, and put on Veſts, that we might look more like a diſtinct People, and not be under the ſervility of imitation, which ever pays a greater deference to the Original; than is conſiſtent with the Equality all Independent Nations ſhould pretend to; <span class="hi">France</span> did not like this ſmall beginning of ill Humours, at leaſt of Emulation, and wiſely conſidering that it is a natural Introduction firſt to make the World their Apes, that they may be afterwards their Slaves. It was thought that one of the Inſtructions Madam brought along with her, was to laugh us out of theſe Veſts, which ſhe performed ſo effectually, that in a moment, like ſo many Footmen who had quitted their Maſters Livery, we all took it again, and returned to our old Service; ſo that the very time of doing it gave a very critical Advantage to <span class="hi">France;</span> ſince it lookt like an Evidence of our returning to their Intereſt, as well as to their Faſhion, and would give ſuch a diſtruſt of us to our new Allies, that it might facilitate the diſ­ſolution of the knot, which tied them ſo within their bounds, that they were very impatient till they were freed from the re­ <span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>aint.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9933"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=95">[Page 75]</a></span> But the Lady had a more extended Com­miſſion than this and without doubt we double-laid the Foundation of a new ſtrict Alliance, quite contrary to the other, in which we had been ſo lately engag'd. And of this there were ſuch early appearances, that the World began to look upon us as fal­ling into Apoſtacy from the common Inte­reſt. Notwithſtanding all this, <span class="hi">France</span> did not neglect at the ſame time to give good words to the <span class="hi">Dutch,</span> and even to feed them with hopes of ſupporting them againſt us, when on a ſudden, that never to be for­gotten Declaration of War againſt them comes out, only to vindicate his own Glory, and to revenge the Injuries done to his Bro­ther in <span class="hi">England,</span> by which he became our Second in this Duel; ſo humble can this Prince be, when at the ſame time he does more Honour than we deſerve, he lays a greater ſhare of the blame upon our Shoul­ders, than did naturally belong to us; the particulars of that War, our part in it while we ſtaid in it, and when we were out of breath, our leaving the <span class="hi">French</span> to make an end of it, are things too well known to make it neceſſary, and too unwelcome in themſelves to incite me to repeat them; only the wiſdom of <span class="hi">France</span> is in this to be obſerv'd, That when we had made a ſepa­rate <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9966"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=96">[Page 76]</a></span> Peace, which left them ſingle to op­poſe the united Force of the Confederates, they were ſo far from being angry, that they would not ſhew ſo much as the leaſt coldneſs, hoping to get as much by our Mediation for a Peace, as they would have expected from our Aſſiſtance in the War, our Circumſtances at that time conſidered; This ſeaſonable piece of Indulgence in not reproach­ing us, but rather allowing thoſe Neceſſities of State which we gave for our Excuſe, was ſuch an engaging Method, that it went a great way to keep us ſtill in their Chains, when, to the Eye of the World, we had abſo­lutely broke looſe from them: And what paſs'd afterwards at <span class="hi">Nimeguen,</span> tho the King's Neu­trality gave him the outward Figure of a Me­diator, it appear'd that his Interpoſition was extremely ſuſpected of Partiality by the Con­federates, who upon that Ground did both at and before the Concluſion of that Treaty, treat his Miniſters there with a great deal of neglect in his Peace as well as that in the <span class="hi">Py­renean</span> and <span class="hi">Aix le Chapelle,</span> the King of <span class="hi">France,</span> at the Moment of making it, had the thought of breaking it; for a very lit­tle time after he broach'd his Pretenſi­ons upon <span class="hi">Aloſt,</span> which were things that if they had been offer'd by a leſs formidable hand, would have been ſmiled at; but ill <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10003"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=96">[Page 77]</a></span> Arguments being ſeconded by good Armies, carry ſuch a power with them, that naked ſenſe is a very unequal Adverſary. It was thought that theſe aiery Claims were chiefly rais'd with the proſpect of getting <span class="hi">Luxen­burg</span> for the Equivalent; and this Opinion was confirm'd by the blocking it up after­wards, pretending to the Country of <span class="hi">Chi­may,</span> that it might be entirely ſurrounded by the French Dominions, and it was ſo preſſed that it might have fallen in a little time, if the King of <span class="hi">France</span> had not ſent Orders to his Troops to retire, and his Chriſtian Generoſity which was aſſign'd for the reaſon of it, made the World ſmile, ſince it is ſeen how differently his devout Zeal works in <span class="hi">Hungary:</span> that ſpecious Rea­ſon was in many reſpects ill-tim'd, and <span class="hi">France</span> it ſelf gave it ſo faintly, that at the very time it look'd out of Countenance; the true ground of his Retiring is worth our obſervation; for at the inſtance of the Confederates, Offices were done, and Me­morials given, but all ineffectual till the word <span class="hi">Parliament</span> was put into them; that powerful word had ſuch an effect, that even at that diſtance it rais'd the Seige, which may convince us of what efficacy the King of <span class="hi">England</span>'s words are, when he will give them their full weight, and threaten with his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10038"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=97">[Page 78]</a></span> <span class="hi">Parliament;</span> it is then that he appears that great Figure we ought to repreſent him in our Minds, the Nation his Body, he the Head, and joined with that Harmony, that every word he pronounces is the Word of a Kingdom: Such words, as appears by this Example, are as effectual as Fleets and Armies, becauſe they can create them, and without this his word ſounds abroad like a faint Whiſper, that is either not heard, or (which is worſe) not minded. But tho <span class="hi">France</span> had made this ſtep of for­ced Compliance, it did not mean to leave off the purſuit of their pretenſions; and therefore immediately propoſed the Arbi­tration to the King; but it appear'd, that notwithſtanding his <span class="hi">Merit</span> towards the Con­federates, in ſaving <span class="hi">Luxenburg,</span> the remem­brances of what had paſſed before, had left ſuch an ill taſte in their <span class="hi">Mouths,</span> that they could not Reliſh our being put into a Con­dition to diſpoſe of their Intereſts, and there­fore declin'd it by inſiſting upon a general Treaty, to which <span class="hi">France</span> has ever ſince con­tinued to be averſe; our great earneſtneſs alſo to perſwade the Confederates to conſent to it, was ſo unuſual, and ſo ſuſpicious a method, that it might naturally make them believe, that <span class="hi">France</span> ſpake to them by our <span class="hi">Mouth,</span> and for that Reaſon, if there has <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10081"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=97">[Page 79]</a></span> been no other, might hinder the accepting it; and ſo little care hath been taken to cure this, or other Jealouſies the Confe­derates may have entertain'd, that quite contrary, their <span class="hi">Miniſters</span> here every day take freſh Alarms, from what they ob­ſerve in ſmall, as well as in greater Circum­ſtances; and they being apt both to take and improve apprehenſions of this kind, draw ſuch Inferences from them, as make them entirely deſpair of us.</p><p>Thus we now ſtand, far from being In­nocent Spectators of our Neighbours Ru­ine, and by a fatal miſtake forgetting what a Certain Fore-runner it is to our own▪ and now it's time our <span class="hi">Trimmer</span> ſhould tell ſomething of his Opinion, upon this pre­ſent State of things abroad, he firſt profeſ­ſes to have no Biaſs, either for or againſt <span class="hi">France,</span> and that his thoughts are wholly directed by the Intereſt of his own Coun­try; he allows, and has read that <span class="hi">Spain</span> uſed the ſame Methods, when it was in its heighth, as <span class="hi">France</span> doth now, and therefore it is not Partiality that moves him; but the juſt fear which all reaſonable Men muſt be poſſeſs'd with, of an over-growing Pow­er; <span class="hi">Ambition</span> is a devouring Beaſt, when it hath ſwallow'd one Province, inſtead of being cloyed, it has ſo much the greater <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10126"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=98">[Page 80]</a></span> <span class="hi">Stomach</span> to another, and being fed, becomes ſtill the more hungry; ſo that for the Con­federates to expect a ſecurity from any thing but their own united ſtrength, is a moſt miſerable fallacy; and if they cannot reſiſt the <span class="hi">Incroachments</span> of <span class="hi">France</span> by their Arms, it is in vain for them to dream of any other means of preſervation; it would have the better grace, beſides the ſaving ſo much Blood and Ruin, to give up all at once; make a Preſent of themſelves, to ap­peaſe this haughty Monarch, rather than be whiſper'd, flatter'd, or cozened out of their liberty. Nothing is ſo ſoft as the firſt applications of a greater Prince, to engage a weaker, but that ſmiling Countenance is but a Vizard, it is not the true Face; for as ſoon as their turn is ſerv'd, the Court­ſhip flies to ſome other Prince or State, where the ſame part is to be acted over again, leaves the old miſtaken Friend, to Neglect and Contempt, and like an inſo­lent Lover to Caſt off Miſtreſs, Reproa­ches her with that Infamy, of which he himſelf was the Author, <span class="hi">Sweden, Bavaria, Palatine, &amp;c.</span> may by their Freſh Exam­ples, teach other Princes what they are reaſonably to expect, and what Snakes are hid under the Flowers the Court of <span class="hi">France</span> ſo liberally throws upon them, whilſt they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10157"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=98">[Page 81]</a></span> can be uſeful. The various Methods and deep Intrigues, with the differing Notes in ſeveral Countries, do not only give ſuſpi­cion, but aſſurance that every thing is put in Practice, by which univerſal Monarchy may be obtain'd.

Having touched upon theſe parti­culars as neceſſary in order to the ſtating the nature of an <span class="hi">equal Bargain,</span> and the Circumſtances belonging to it, let it now be examined in two or three inſtances▪ what things are <span class="hi">not</span> to be admitted by way of Contract, to paſs under the Name of an <span class="hi">Equivalent.</span></p><p>Firſt, Though it will be allowed, that in the general corruption of mankind, which will not admit <span class="hi">Juſtice</span> alone to be a ſuffi­cient tie to make good a Contract, that a <span class="hi">Puniſhment</span> added for the breach of it, is a <span class="hi">fitting</span> or rather a <span class="hi">neceſſary</span> Circum­ſtance; yet it does not follow, that in <span class="hi">all</span> caſes, a <span class="hi">great Penalty</span> upon the party offend­ing is an <span class="hi">abſolute</span> and an <span class="hi">entire Security.</span> It muſt be conſidered in every particular caſe, how far the <span class="hi">Circumſtances</span> may ratio­nally lead a Man to <span class="hi">rely more</span> or <span class="hi">leſs</span> upon it.</p><p>In a private inſtance, the <span class="hi">Penalty</span> inflict­ed upon the breach of Contract muſt be firſt, ſuch a one as the party injured <span class="hi">can en­force,</span> and Secondly, ſuch a one as he <span class="hi">will enforce,</span> when it is in his power.</p><p>If the <span class="hi">Offending party</span> is in a capacity of <span class="hi">hindring</span> the other from bringing the Ven­geance of the Law upon him.

Secondly, The <span class="hi">forfeiture</span> or <span class="hi">puniſhment</span> muſt be ſuch as the Man aggrieved will <span class="hi">take;</span> for Example, if upon a Bargain, one of the Parties ſhall ſtipulate to ſubject himſelf, in caſe of his <span class="hi">failure</span> to have his <span class="hi">Ears cut,</span> or his <span class="hi">Noſe ſlit</span> by the other, with <span class="hi">ſecurity</span> given, that he ſhall not be proſecuted for <span class="hi">executing</span> this part of the Agreement; the <span class="hi">Penalty</span> is no doubt <span class="hi">heavy enough</span> to diſcourage a Man from breaking his Contract; but on the other ſide it is of <span class="hi">ſuch a kind,</span> that the other how much ſoever he may be provo­ked, will not in cold Blood care to inflict it. Such an extravagant Clauſe would ſeem to be made only for <span class="hi">ſhew</span> and <span class="hi">found,</span> and no Man would think himſelf ſafer by a thing which one way or other is ſure to prove <span class="hi">ineffectual.</span></p><p>In a <span class="hi">publick</span> Caſe, Suppoſe in a Govern­ment ſo conſtituted that a <span class="hi">Law</span> may be made in the nature of a <span class="hi">Bargain,</span> it is in <span class="hi">it ſelf</span> no more than a <span class="hi">dead letter,</span> the <span class="hi">life</span> is given to it by the <span class="hi">execution</span> of what it con­taineth; ſo that let it in it ſelf be never ſo perfect, it <span class="hi">dependeth</span> upon thoſe who are intruſted with ſeeing it <span class="hi">obſerved.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13027"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=120">[Page 26]</a></span> If it is in any Country, where the <span class="hi">chief Magiſtrate</span> chuſeth the <span class="hi">Judges,</span> and the <span class="hi">Jud­ges</span> interpret the <span class="hi">Laws;</span> a <span class="hi">Penalty</span> in any one particular Law can have no effect but what is <span class="hi">precarious.</span> It may have a <span class="hi">loud voice</span> to threaten, but it has not an <span class="hi">hand</span> to give a blow; for as long as the Governing Pow­er is in poſſeſſion of this Prerogative, let who will chuſe the <span class="hi">Meat,</span> if they chuſe the <span class="hi">Cooks,</span> it is they that will give the <span class="hi">taſt</span> to it.

Further, he cannot enjoyn the <span class="hi">Heir</span> or <span class="hi">Succeſſor</span> to for­bear the exerciſe of any Right that is <span class="hi">in­herent</span> to him, as he is a Man; neither can <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13140"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=120">[Page 27]</a></span> he <span class="hi">reſtrain</span> him without his own conſent, from doing any act which in it ſelf is <span class="hi">lawful,</span> and liable to <span class="hi">no objection.</span> For Example, A <span class="hi">Father</span> cannot ſtipulate with any other Man, that in Conſideration of ſuch a thing done, or to be done, his <span class="hi">Son</span> ſhall <span class="hi">never Marry;</span> becauſe Marriage is an Inſtitution <span class="hi">Eſtabli­ſhed</span> by the Laws of God, and Man, and therefore no body can be ſo reſtrained by any power from doing <span class="hi">ſuch</span> an act, when he thinketh fit, being <span class="hi">warranted</span> by an Authority that is not to be controuled.</p><p>XIX.

To put it yet farther, Suppoſe a Clauſe in ſuch a Law, that it ſhall be <span class="hi">criminal</span> in the laſt degree for any Man choſen in a ſubſequent Aſſembly, to <span class="hi">propoſe</span> the <span class="hi">repealing</span> of it; and ſince nothing can be <span class="hi">Enacted</span> which is not firſt <span class="hi">propoſed,</span> by this means it ſeemeth as if a Law might be Created which ſhould <span class="hi">never die.</span> But let this be Examined.</p><p>Firſt, ſuch a clauſe would be ſo <span class="hi">de­ſtructive</span> to the <span class="hi">being</span> of ſuch a Conſtitution, as that it would be as reaſonable to ſay, that a King had right to <span class="hi">give</span> or <span class="hi">ſell</span> his King­dom to a <span class="hi">foreign Prince,</span> as that any num­ber of Men who are <span class="hi">entruſted</span> with the Su­preme Power, or any part of it, ſhould have a right to <span class="hi">impoſe</span> ſuch Shackles▪ upon the Liberty of thoſe who are to <span class="hi">ſucceed</span> them in the <span class="hi">ſame Truſt.</span> The ground of that <span class="hi">Truſt</span> is, that every Man who is choſen into ſuch an Aſſembly, is to do all that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13529"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=122">[Page 31]</a></span> in him lieth for the <span class="hi">good</span> of thoſe who <span class="hi">choſe</span> him: The Engliſh of ſuch a Clauſe would be, that he is <span class="hi">not</span> to do his <span class="hi">beſt</span> for thoſe that <span class="hi">choſe</span> him, becauſe though he ſhould be <span class="hi">convinc'd</span> that it might be very <span class="hi">fatal</span> to <span class="hi">continue</span> that <span class="hi">Law,</span> and therefore very <span class="hi">ne­ceſſary</span> to <span class="hi">repeal</span> it, yet he muſt not repeal it, becauſe it is made a <span class="hi">Crime,</span> and attended with a <span class="hi">Penalty.</span></p><p>But ſecondly, to ſhew the <span class="hi">emptineſs</span> as well as <span class="hi">injuſtice</span> of ſuch a Clauſe, it is clear, that although ſuch an Invaſion of Right ſhould be impoſed, it will never be obeyed: There will only be <span class="hi">Deformity,</span> in the <span class="hi">Mon­ſter,</span> it will neither <span class="hi">ſting</span> nor <span class="hi">bite.</span> Such <span class="hi">Law-givers</span> would only have the honour of attempting a <span class="hi">contradiction</span> which can ne­ver have any ſucceſs; for as ſuch a <span class="hi">Law</span> in it ſelf would be a <span class="hi">Madneſs,</span> ſo the <span class="hi">Penalty</span> would be a <span class="hi">Jeſt;</span> which may be thus made out.</p><p>XXII. A Law that carrieth in it ſelf <span class="hi">Rea­ſon</span> enough to <span class="hi">ſupport</span> it, is ſo far from want­ing the <span class="hi">protection</span> of ſuch a Clauſe, or from <span class="hi">needing</span> to take ſuch an <span class="hi">extraordinary receipt</span> for long Life, that the <span class="hi">admitting</span> it muſt certainly be the <span class="hi">likelieſt</span> and the <span class="hi">ſhorteſt</span> way to <span class="hi">deſtroy</span> it; ſuch a Clauſe in a Law muſt imply an opinion that the <span class="hi">greateſt</span> part of mankind is <span class="hi">againſt</span> it, ſince it is im­poſſible <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13661"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=123">[Page 32]</a></span> ſuch an exorbitance ſhould be done for its <span class="hi">own ſake;</span> the end of it muſt be to <span class="hi">force</span> Men by a <span class="hi">Penalty,</span> to that which they could <span class="hi">not</span> be <span class="hi">perſwaded</span> to, whilſt their Rea­ſon is left at <span class="hi">liberty.</span> This Poſition being granted, which I think can hardly be deni­ed, put the caſe that a Law ſhould be made with this <span class="hi">imaginary</span> Clauſe of <span class="hi">Immortality,</span> after which another <span class="hi">Aſſembly</span> is choſen, and if the majority of the <span class="hi">Electors</span> ſhall be <span class="hi">againſt</span> this Law, the greater part of the <span class="hi">Elected</span> muſt be <span class="hi">ſo</span> too, if the choice is fair and re­gular; which muſt be preſumed, ſince the ſuppoſition of the contrary is not to come within this Argument. When theſe Men ſhall meet, the <span class="hi">Majority</span> will be viſible be­forehand of thoſe who are <span class="hi">againſt</span> ſuch a Law, ſo that there will be no <span class="hi">hazard</span> to any ſingle Man in propoſing the <span class="hi">Repeal</span> of it, when he cannot be <span class="hi">puniſhed</span> but by the <span class="hi">Majority,</span> and he hath ſuch a kind of aſſur­ance as cometh near a Demonſtration, that the <span class="hi">greater Number</span> will be of his mind, and conſequently, that for their own ſakes they <span class="hi">will ſecure</span> him from any danger.</p><p>For theſe Reaſons, where-ever in order to the making a Bargain, a Proposition is advanc'd to make a <span class="hi">new Law,</span> which is to <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ye up thoſe who neither <span class="hi">can</span> nor <span class="hi">will be bound</span> by it, it may be a good <span class="hi">Jeſt,</span> but it will never be a good <span class="hi">Equivalent.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13764"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=123">[Page 33]</a></span> XXIII. In the laſt place, let it be examin­ed how far a <span class="hi">Promiſe</span> ought to be taken far a <span class="hi">Security</span> in a Bargain.</p><p>There is great Variety of Methods for the <span class="hi">Security</span> of thoſe that deal, according to their <span class="hi">Diſpoſitions</span> and <span class="hi">Intereſts;</span> ſome are <span class="hi">binding,</span> others inducing circumſtances, and are to be ſo diſtinguiſhed.</p><p>Firſt, <span class="hi">Ready Payment</span> is without excepti­on, ſo of that there can be no diſpute; in default of that, the <span class="hi">good Opinion</span> Men may have of one another is a great ingredient to ſupply the want of <span class="hi">immediate</span> Perform­ances. Where the Truſt is grounded upon <span class="hi">Inclination</span> only, the Generoſity is not al­ways <span class="hi">return'd;</span> but where it ſpringeth from a <span class="hi">long Experience</span> it is a better foundation, and yet that is not always <span class="hi">ſecure.</span> In ordi­nary dealing, <span class="hi">one Promiſe</span> may be an <span class="hi">Equi­valent</span> to <span class="hi">another,</span> but it is not ſo for a thing <span class="hi">actually</span> granted or conveyed; eſpe­cially if the thing required in exchange for it, is of great <span class="hi">value,</span> either in <span class="hi">it ſelf</span> or in its <span class="hi">conſequences.</span> A <span class="hi">bare</span> Promiſe as a <span class="hi">ſingle Security</span> in ſuch a caſe is not an <span class="hi">equal</span> pro­poſal; if it is offered by way of <span class="hi">addition,</span> it generally giveth cauſe to doubt the Title is crazy, where ſo <span class="hi">ſlender</span> a thing is brought in to be a <span class="hi">ſupplement.</span></p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13870"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=124">[Page 34]</a></span> XXIV. The <span class="hi">Earneſt</span> of making good a Promiſe, muſt be ſuch a behaviour <span class="hi">preceding;</span> as may encourage the party to whom it is made to depend upon it: Where inſtead of that, there hath been <span class="hi">want of Kindneſs;</span> and which is worſe an <span class="hi">Invaſion</span> of <span class="hi">Right,</span> a Promiſe hath no perſwading force; and till the <span class="hi">Objection</span> to ſuch a Proceeding is <span class="hi">forgot­ten,</span> (which can only be the work of time) and the Skin is a little grown over the ten­der part, the Wound muſt not be touch'd. There muſt be ſome <span class="hi">Intermiſſion</span> at leaſt to abate the ſmart of <span class="hi">unkind uſage,</span> or elſe a Promiſe in the Eye of the party injur'd is ſo far from <span class="hi">ſtrengthening</span> a Security, that it raiſeth more <span class="hi">doubts,</span> and giveth more juſti­fiable cauſe <span class="hi">ſuſpect</span> it.</p><p>A <span class="hi">Word</span> is not like a Bone, that be­ing broken and well ſet again, is ſaid to be ſometimes ſtronger in that very part: It is far from being ſo in a <span class="hi">Word</span> given and <span class="hi">not made good.</span> Every ſingle Act either <span class="hi">weakeneth</span> or <span class="hi">improveth</span> our Credit with o­ther Men; and as an habit of being <span class="hi">juſt</span> to our Word will <span class="hi">confirm,</span> ſo an habit of too freely <span class="hi">diſpenſing</span> with it muſt neceſſarily <span class="hi">deſtroy</span> it. A <span class="hi">Promiſe</span> hath its effect to perſwade a Man to lay ſome weight upon it, where the <span class="hi">Promiſer</span> hath not only the <span class="hi">power,</span> but may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13961"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=124">[Page 35]</a></span> have the <span class="hi">will</span> of performing it; and further, that there be no <span class="hi">viſible intereſt</span> of the party promiſing to excuſe himſelf from it, or to evade it.</p><p>All Obligations are <span class="hi">comparative,</span> and where they ſeem to be oppoſite, or between the greater and the leſſer, which of them ought to have precedence in all reſpects every man is apt to be his <span class="hi">own Judge.</span></p><p>XXV. If it ſhould fall out that the <span class="hi">Pro­miſer</span> with full <span class="hi">intent</span> at the <span class="hi">time</span> to per­form, might by the interposition of <span class="hi">new Arguments,</span> or <span class="hi">differing Advice</span> think him­ſelf oblig'd to turn the matter of Conſcience on the <span class="hi">other</span> ſide, and ſhould look upon it to be much a <span class="hi">greater</span> fault to <span class="hi">keep</span> his word than to <span class="hi">break</span> it; ſuch a Belief will <span class="hi">untye</span> the <span class="hi">ſtricteſt Promiſe</span> that can be made, and though the Party thus abſolving himſelf ſhould do it <span class="hi">without</span> the mixture or tempta­tion of <span class="hi">private intereſt,</span> being moved to it meerly by his <span class="hi">Conſcience,</span> as then informed; yet how far ſoever that might diminiſh the <span class="hi">Fault</span> in <span class="hi">him,</span> it would in no degree leſſen the <span class="hi">inconveniences</span> to the <span class="hi">party</span> who is <span class="hi">diſappointed,</span> by the breach of an engage­ment upon which he relyed.</p><p>XXVI. A <span class="hi">Promiſe</span> is to be underſtood in the <span class="hi">plain</span> and <span class="hi">natural</span> ſenſe of the words, and to be ſure not in his who <span class="hi">made</span> it, if it <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e14063"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=125">[Page 36]</a></span> was given as part of a Bargain. That would be like giving a Man power to <span class="hi">raiſe</span> the <span class="hi">value</span> of his Money in the payment of his <span class="hi">Debt,</span> by which, tho he paid but half or leſs, be might pretend according to the letter to have made good the Contract.</p><p>The <span class="hi">power</span> of <span class="hi">interpreting</span> a Promiſe intire­ly taketh away the <span class="hi">virtue</span> of it. A Mer­chant who ſhould once aſſume that privi­lege, would ſave himſelf the trouble of mak­ing any more Bargains.</p><p>It is ſtill worſe if this <span class="hi">Juriſdiction</span> over a Man's <span class="hi">Promiſe,</span> ſhould be <span class="hi">lodg'd</span> in hands that have Power to ſupport ſuch an <span class="hi">extraor­dinary Claim;</span> and if in <span class="hi">other</span> Caſes, forbear­ing to deal upon thoſe terms is <span class="hi">adviſable,</span> in this it becometh abſolutely <span class="hi">neceſſary.</span></p><p>XXVII. There muſt in all reſpects be a full liberty to <span class="hi">claim</span> a Promiſe, to make it reaſon­able to <span class="hi">take</span> it in any part of payment; elſe it would be like agreeing for a <span class="hi">Rent,</span> and at the ſame time making if <span class="hi">criminal</span> to <span class="hi">demand it.</span></p><p>A <span class="hi">ſuperiority</span> of <span class="hi">Dignity</span> or <span class="hi">Power</span> in the party promiſing maketh it a more <span class="hi">tender</span> thing for the other party to treat upon that ſecurity.

It might be wiſhed that you would have ſuppreſſed your impatience, and have been content for the ſake of Religion, to enjoy it within your ſelves without the Liberty of a publick Ex­erciſe, till a Parliament had allowed it; but ſince that could not be, and that the Artifices of ſome amongſt you have made uſe of the Well-meant Zeal of the generality to draw them into this Miſtake; I am ſo far from blaming you with that ſharpneſs which perhaps, the Matter in ſtrictneſs would bear, that I am ready to err on the ſide of the more gentle conſtruction.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e15357"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=136">[Page 15]</a></span> There is a great difference between enjoying quietly the Advantages of an Act irregularly done by others, and the going about to ſupport it againſt the Laws in being: the Law is ſo Sacred, that no Treſpaſs againſt it is to be defended; yet Frailties may in ſome meaſure be excuſed, when they cannot be juſtified.

There is no other Anſwer but this, Look to your Moate.</p><p>The firſt Article of an <span class="hi">Engliſh-mans</span> Po­litical Creed muſt be, That he believeth in the Sea, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> without that there needed no General Council to pronounce him capable of Salvation here.</p><p>We are in an Iſland confin'd to it by God Almighty, not as a Penalty but a Grace, and one of the greateſt that can be given to Mankind. Happy Confinement that has made us Free, Rich, and Quiet; a fair Portion in this World, and very well worth the preſerving, a Figure that ever hath been envied, and could never be imi­tated by our Neighbours. Our Situation hath made Greatneſs abroad by Land Con­queſts unnatural things to us. It is true, we made Excurſions, and glorious ones too, which make our Names great in Hiſtory, but they did not laſt.</p><p>Admit the <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> to be Giants in Cou­rage, yet they muſt not hope to ſucceed in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16952"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=169">[Page 3]</a></span> making War againſt Heaven, which ſeem­eth to have enjoyned them to acquieſce in being happy within their own Circle. It is no Paradox to ſay, that <span class="hi">England</span> hath its Root in the Sea, and a deep one too, from whence it ſendeth its Branches into both the <span class="hi">Indies.</span> We may ſay further in our preſent Caſe, That if <span class="hi">Allegiance</span> is due to <span class="hi">Protection,</span> ours to the Sea is due from that Rule, ſince by that, and by that alone, we are to be protected; and if we have of late ſuffered Uſurpation of other Methods, con­trary to the Homage we owe to that which muſt preſerve us. It is time now to re­ſtore the <span class="hi">Sea</span> to its right; and as there is no Repentance effectual without Amend­ment, ſo there is not a moment to be loſt in their going about it.</p><p>It is not pretended to launch into ſuch a Voluminous Treatiſe, as to ſet down every thing to which ſo comprehenſive a Subject might lead me; for as the Sea hath little leſs variety in it than the Land; ſo the Naval Force of <span class="hi">England</span> extendeth it ſelf into a great many Branches, each of which are important enough to require a Diſcourſe apart, and peculiarly applied to it: But there muſt be preference to ſome Conſideration above others, when the weight of them is ſo viſibly Superior that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16984"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=170">[Page 4]</a></span> it cannot be conteſted. It is there, firſt, that the Foundations are to be laid of our Naval Oeconomy; amongſt theſe, there is one Article which in its own Nature muſt be allowed to be the Corner-ſtone of the Building.</p><p>The Choice of <span class="hi">Officers,</span> with the <span class="hi">Diſci­pline</span> and <span class="hi">Encouragement</span> belonging to them. Upon this Head only, I ſhall then take the liberty to venture my Opinion into the World, with a real Submiſſion to thoſe, who may offer any think better for the advan­tage of the <span class="hi">Publick.</span></p><p>The firſt Queſtion then will be, Out of what ſort of Men the <span class="hi">Officers</span> of the <span class="hi">Fleet</span> are to be choſen; and this immediately leadeth us to the preſent Controverſy be­tween the <span class="hi">Gentlemen</span> and the <span class="hi">Tarpau­lins.</span></p><p>The uſual Objection on both ſides are too general to be relied upon. Partiality and Common Prejudices direct moſt Mens Opinions, without entring into the parti­cular Reaſons which ought to be the ground of it. There is ſo much eaſe in aquieſcing in Generals, that the Ignorance of thoſe who cannot diſtinguiſh, and the Largeneſs of thoſe who will not, maketh Men very apt to decline the trouble of ſtricter Enqui­ries, which they think too great a price <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17029"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=170">[Page 5]</a></span> for being in the right, let it be never ſo valuable.</p><p>This maketh them judge in the Lump, and either let their Opinions ſwim along with the Stream of the World, or give them up wholly to be directed by Succeſs. The effect of this is, that they change their Minds upon every preſent uneaſineſs, wanting a ſteady Foundation upon which their Judgment ſhould be formed. This is a pearching upon the Twigs of things, and not going to the Root. But ſure the Matter in queſtion deſerveth to be examined in another manner, ſince ſo much depend­eth upon it.</p><p>To ſtate the thing impartially, it muſt be owned that it ſeemeth to lye faireſt for the <span class="hi">Tarpaulin:</span> It giveth an Impreſſion that muſt have ſo much weight as to make a Man's Opinion lean very much on that ſide, it carrieth ſo much Authority with it, it ſeemeth to be ſo unqueſtionable, that thoſe are fitteſt to Command at Sea, who have not only made it their <span class="hi">Calling,</span> but their <span class="hi">Element;</span> that there muſt naturally be a prejudice to any thing then can be ſaid againſt it. There muſt therefore be ſome Reaſon extraordinary to ſupport the Argument on the other ſide, or elſe the Gentlemen could never enter the Liſts <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17046"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=171">[Page 6]</a></span> againſt ſuch a violent Objection, which ſeemeth not to be reſiſted. I will intro­duce my Argument with an Aſſertion, which as I take to be true almoſt in all Caſes, ſo it is neceſſary to be explained and inforced in this. The <span class="hi">Aſſertion</span> is, that there is hardly a ſingle Propoſition to be made, which is not deceitful, and the ty­ing our Reaſon too cloſe to it, may in ma­ny Caſes be deſtructive. Circumſtances muſt come in, and are to be made a part of the Matter of which we are to judge; poſitive <span class="hi">Deciſions</span> are always dangerous, more eſpecially in <span class="hi">Politicks.</span> A Man, who will be Maſter of an Argument, muſt do like a skilful General, who ſendeth Scouts on all ſides, to ſee whether there may not be an Enemy. So he muſt look round to ſee what Objections can be made, and not go on in a ſtreight Line, which in the ready way to lead him into a mi­ſtake.</p><p>Before then, that we conclude what ſort of Men are fitteſt to Command at Sea, a Principle is to be laid down, that there is a differing Conſideration to be had of ſuch a Subject-matter, as is in it ſelf diſtinct and independent, and of ſuch a one as being a Limb of a Body, or a Wheel of a Frame, there is a neceſſity of ſuiting it to the reſt, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17068"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=171">[Page 7]</a></span> and preſerving the Harmony of the whole. A Man muſt not in that Caſe reſtrain him­ſelf to the ſeperate Conſideration of that ſingle Part, but muſt take care it may fall in and agree with the Shape of the whole Creature, of which it is a Member. Ac­cording to this Propoſition, which I take to be indiſputable, it will not I hope appear an Affectation, or an extravagant Fit of un­ſeaſonable Politicks, if, before I enter into the particular State of the preſent Queſtion, I ſay ſomething of the Government of <span class="hi">Eng­land,</span> and make that the Ground-work of what ſort of Men are moſt proper to be made uſe of to Command at Sea.</p><p>The Forms of Government to which <span class="hi">England</span> muſt be ſubjected, are either <span class="hi">Ab­ſolute Monarchy,</span> a <span class="hi">Commonwealth,</span> or a <span class="hi">Mixt Monarchy,</span> as it is now; with thoſe natural Alterations that the Exegency of Affairs may from time to time ſuggeſt. As to Abſolute Monarchy I will not allow my ſelf to be tranſported into ſuch Inve­ctives, as are generally made.againſt it; neither am I ready to enter into the aggre­vating Stile of calling every thing <span class="hi">Slavery,</span> that reſtraineth Men in any part of their Freedom: One may diſcern in this, as in moſt other things, the good and bad of it. We ſee by too near an Iſtance, what <span class="hi">Fra<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>e</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17112"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=172">[Page 8]</a></span> doth by it; it doth not only ſtruggle with the reſt of <span class="hi">Chriſtendom;</span> but is in a fair way of giving Law to it.</p><p>This is owing in great Meaſure to a <span class="hi">Deſpotick</span> and Undivided Power; the un­controulable Authority of the Directive Councils maketh every thing move with­out Diſorder or Oppoſition, which muſt give an advantage, that is plain enough of it ſelf, without being proved by the melancholly Experience we have of it at this time.</p><p>I ſee and admire this; yet I conſider at the ſame time, that all things of this kind are comparative: That as on one ſide, without <span class="hi">Government</span> Men cannot enjoy what belongeth to them in particular, nor can a Nation be ſecure, or preſerve it ſelf in general: So on the other ſide, the end of <span class="hi">Government</span> being, that Mankind ſhould live in ſome competent State of Freedom, it is very unnatural to have the <span class="hi">End</span> de­ſtroyed by the <span class="hi">Means</span> that were originally made uſe of to attain it. In this reſpect ſomething is to be ventured, rather than ſubmit to ſuch a precarious State of Life, as would make it a Burthen to a reaſonable Creature; and therefore, after I have own­ed the Advantages in ſome kind of an un­limitted Government; yet, while they are <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17147"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=172">[Page 9]</a></span> attended with ſo many other diſcouraging Circumſtances, I cannot think but that they may be bought too dear; and if it ſhould be ſo, that it is not poſſible for a <span class="hi">State</span> to be <span class="hi">Great</span> and <span class="hi">Glorious,</span> unleſs the Subjects are <span class="hi">wretchedly Miſerable.</span> I am aſhamed to own my low-ſpirited frailty in preferring ſuch a Model of Government, as may agree with the reaſonable Enjoy­ment of a <span class="hi">Free People,</span> before ſuch a one, by which Empire is to be extended at ſuch an unnatural Price. Beſides whatever Mens Opinions may be one way or another, in the general Question, there is an Argu­ment in our Caſe that ſhutteth the Door to any Anſwer to it. (<span class="hi">Viz.</span>) We cannot ſub­ſiſt under a <span class="hi">Deſpotick</span> Power, our very Being would be deſtroyed by it; for we are to conſider, we are a very little Spot in the Map of the World, and make a great Figure only by <span class="hi">Trade,</span> which is the Crea­ture of Liberty; one deſtroyed, the other falleth to the Ground by a natural Conſe­quence, that will not admit a diſpute. If we would be meaſured by our Acres, we are poor inconſiderable People; we are ex­alted above our natural Bounds, by our good Laws, and our excellent Conſtitu­tion. By this we are not only happy at Home, but conſiderable Abroad. Our Si­tuation, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17192"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=173">[Page 10]</a></span> our Humour, our Trade, do all concur to ſtrengthen this Argument. So that all other Reaſons muſt give place to ſuch a one as maketh it out, that there is no Mean between a <span class="hi">Free Nation</span> and <span class="hi">No Nation.</span></p><p>We are no more a People, nor <span class="hi">England</span> can no longer keep its Name from the mo­ment that our Liberties are extinguiſh'd; the Vital Strength that ſhould ſupport us being withdrawn, we ſhould then be no more than the Carcaſs of a Nation, with no other Security than that of <span class="hi">Contempt;</span> and to ſubſiſt upon no other Tenure, than that we ſhould be below the giving Temp­tation to our ſtronger Neighbours to de­vour us. In my Judgment, therefore, there is ſuch a.ſhort Deciſion to be made upon this Subject, that in Relation to <span class="hi">England,</span> an <span class="hi">Abſolute Monarchy</span> is as an unreaſonable thing to be wiſhed, as I hope it will be impoſſible to be obtained.</p><p>It muſt be conſidered in the next place, whether <span class="hi">England</span> likely is to be turn'd into a Commonwealth. It is hard at any time to determine what will be the Shape of the next Revolution, much more at this time would it be inexcuſably Arrogant to undertake it. Who can foreſee whether it will be from without, or from within, or <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17226"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=173">[Page 11]</a></span> from both? Whether with or without the Concurrence of the People? Whether regu­larly produced, or violently impoſed? I ſhall not therefore <span class="hi">Magiſterially</span> declare it impoſ­ſible that a <span class="hi">Commonwealth</span> ſhould be ſettled here; but I may give my humble Opinion, that according to all appearances, it is ve­ry improbable.</p><p>I will firſt lay it down for a Principle, That it is not a ſound way of arguing, to ſay, That if it can be made out, that the Form of a <span class="hi">Commonwealth</span> will beſt ſuit with the Intereſt of the Nation, it muſt for that reaſon of neceſſity prevail.</p><p>I will not deny but that <span class="hi">Intereſt</span> will not lie, is a right <span class="hi">Maxim,</span> where-ever it is ſure to be underſtood; elſe one had as good af­firm, That no Man in particular, nor Man­kind in general, can ever be miſtaken. A Nation is a great while before they can ſee, and generally they muſt feel firſt before their Sight is quite cleared. This <span class="hi">maketh</span> it ſo long before they can ſee their <span class="hi">Intereſt;</span> that for the moſt part it is too late for them to purſue it: If Men muſt be ſuppoſed al­ways to follow their true <span class="hi">Intereſt,</span> it muſt be meant of a New Manufactory of Man­kind by God Almighty; there muſt be ſome new <span class="hi">Clay,</span> the old <span class="hi">Stuff</span> never yet made any ſuch infallible Creature.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17281"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=174">[Page 12]</a></span> This being premis'd, it is to be inquired, Whether inſtead of inclination, or a leaning towards a <span class="hi">Commonwealth,</span> there is not in <span class="hi">England</span> a general diſlike to it; if this be ſo as I take it to be, by a very great diſparity in Numbers; it will be in vain to diſpute the <span class="hi">Reaſon,</span> whilſt <span class="hi">Humour</span> is againſt it, al­lowing the weight that is due to the Argu­ment, which may be alledged for it; yet, if the <span class="hi">Herd</span> is againſt it, the going about to convince them, would have no other ef­fect than to ſhew that nothing can be more impertinent than good <span class="hi">Reaſons,</span> when they are miſplaced or ill-timed.</p><p>I muſt obſerve, That there muſt be ſome previous Diſpoſitions in all great Changes to facilitate and to make way for them: I think it not at all abſur'd, I affirm That ſuch Reſolutions are ſeldem made at all, ex­cept by the general Preparations of Mens Minds they are half made before, and it is plainly viſible, that Men go about them.</p><p>Though it ſeemeth to me that the Argu­ment alone maketh all others unneceſſary, yet I muſt take notice that▪ beſides what hath been ſaid upon this Subject, there are cer­tain Preliminaries to the firſt building a <span class="hi">Commonwealth.</span> Some Materials abſolutely neceſſary for the carrying on ſuch a <span class="hi">Fabick,</span> which at preſent are wanting amongſt us, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17328"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=174">[Page 13]</a></span> I mean <span class="hi">Virtue, Morality, Diligence,</span> or at leaſt <span class="hi">Hypocriſy.</span> Now this Age is ſo plain dealing, as not to diſſemble ſo far as to an outward▪ Pretence of <span class="hi">Qualities</span> which ſeem at preſent ſo <span class="hi">Vnfaſhionable,</span> and under ſo much Diſcountenance.</p><p>From hence we may draw a plain and na­tural Inference, That a <span class="hi">Commonwealth</span> is not fit for us, becauſe we are not fit for a <span class="hi">Commonwealth.</span></p><p>This being granted, the Suppoſition of this Form of Government of <span class="hi">England,</span> with all its Conſequences as to the preſent Que­ſtion, muſt be excluded; and <span class="hi">Abſolute Mo­narchy</span> having been ſo too by the Reaſons at once alledged, it will without further Examination fall to a <span class="hi">Mixt Government,</span> as we now are. I will not ſay, that there is never to be any Alteration; the Conſti­tution of the ſeveral Parts that concur to make up the Frame of the preſent Govern­ment, may be altered in many things, in ſome for the better, and in others, perhaps for the worſe, according as Circumſtances ſhall ariſe to induce a <span class="hi">Change;</span> and as Paſ­ſion and Intereſt ſhall have more or leſs In­fluence upon the Publick Councils; but ſtill, if it remaineth in the whole ſo far a a <span class="hi">mixt Monarchy,</span> that there ſhall be a re­ſtraint upon the <span class="hi">Prince,</span> as to the Exerciſe <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e17391"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52156&amp;page=175">[Page 14]</a></span> of a <span class="hi">Deſpotick Power,</span> it is enough to make it a Groundwork for the preſent Queſtion.
