VVHat a ſorry Life I live,

ſince that Love hath found me,

And what Treaſures would I give,

that Cupid had not bound me:

For his Dart hath pierc'd my Heart,

I cannot endure it,

And inflicted ſo much ſmart,

That no Herb can cure it.

Surely Cupid is not blind.

but hath Eyes to ſée with,

And his Dart hath prov'd unkind,

that he wounded me with;

For it did all Comfort Kill

when it pierc'd into me,

And my Soul with ſorry fil'd,

Oh! it will undo me.

Heavens bleſs my dying Heart,

heavenly Powers defend me,

Love néed not uſe ſo much Art

and Cruelty to bend me:

For my ſilly Soul did yield,

when 'twas firſt aſſailed,

And to Cupid gave the Field,

Oh! then my ſpirits failed.

Cupid, What is thy intent.

what is thy deſire?

Let thy Bow be now unbent,

for I am all on fire:

O! ſwéet gentle God of Love,

let thy Arrows miſs me,

Let her whom (in vain) I love▪

Kill me, if not kiſs me.

What a pining Life have I,

what a ſad Condition?

Eaſe me Love, and let me fly,

this lingring Contrition:

Kiſs me, or elſe cure my Wound,

O! ſome pitty ſhow me;

Can there no Relief be found,

But Love muſt overflow me.

If my worthleſs Body muſt,

be thy Arrows di [...]t,

Then convert me into Duſt,

and let me have ſome quiet:

Let thy Arrows take their fill,

ſince ſhe cannot abide me,

With my Blood, come Cupid ſwill,

Thou enough haſt try'd me.

_[figure]_

_[figure]_

FOre'd I am to yield I ſée,

and adore thy Power,

For thy Art hath conquer'd me,

and hath brought me lower:

I that did before neglect,

and diſpiſe to love thée,

Give thée now all due reſpect,

And for pitty move thee.

O! ſwéet Love be not ſo fierce,

but with pitty moved,

Let thy Golden Arrow pierce,

the Heart of my beloved:

Let us ſhare in equal parts,

and proſtrate lie before the,

Then our joyful flaming hearts,

For ever ſhall Implore thee.

(he lies down.)

The Authour.

Cupid hearing this Complaint,

fearing 'twould undo him,

Sends his beſt beloved Saint,

fitly fixt unto him?

Cupid doth himſelf deſcend,

from his ſhrine of Glory,

To compleat the happy end.

Of this Lovers ſtory.

Cupid.

Loaging Lover live and leave,

this thy ſad Lamenting,

Though the Arrows in my ſheave

cauſe this Diſcontenting:

By my Quiver and my Bow,

I ſwear ſhe ſhall not miſs thée,

I'le preſent Her to thée now,

Court her and ſhe'll kiſs thee.

Philida.

Where's this loyal Lover that

ſo with pitty moves me,

Jove forbid that I ſhould hate,

Or kill the Thing that loves me:

I am none of thoſe coy Girles,

that to Death will doom thée,

Knights, & Lords, & Dukes & Earls

ſhall not take me from thee.

Florio.

What ſwéet words have I heard ſaid,

lovely ſmooth and even,

Cupid ſure hath ſtruck me dead,

and I am now in Heaven:

This is Philida I ſée,

with all joys about Her,

Heaven cannot Heaven be,

If it is without her.

Philida.

Sure 'tis Florio appears,

(as God Cupid chain'd him)

He hath Lov'd me ſeven Years,

and I as long diſdain'd him:

But the God hath ſtruck my heart

and put Love into me,

If Florio ſhould play my part,

'I would utterly undo me.

Florio.

Philida! Oh! Philida,

let me come and Court thée,

By Loves pure and precious Law

I vow, I will not hurt thé:

Saints with Angles that are good,

do as much as this is,

I ſwear no motion of my blood,

ſhall mingle with our Kiſſes.

Philida.

I'le not tie thée up to that,

prethée Kiſs and ſpare not,

And what more thou would'ſt be at,

in this ſit I fear not:

Love cannot be fed with Air,

Kiſſes are but Bubbles,

But let's be a Wedded pair,

To avoid all troubles.

Florio.

That's a real royal way,

to prevent miſcarriage,

There's no Wormwood in the  [...]oy,

that is mixt in Marriage:

Quick let's to the Altar go,

there to be made Fellows.

Men and Maide are Fire & Tow,

When Cupid blows the Bellows.

FINIS.
