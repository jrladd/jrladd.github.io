## TO THE Chriſtian Reader Grace and Peace.

IT pleaſed the Al­wiſe and holy GOD, who or­ders all events to his own glory,
to make uſe of my late Seceſsion for the producing of divers, not, I [[Page
8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=3) hope unprofitable
Tractates; wherein I much rejoyce that my declined Age, even in that
retiredneſs, might be in any meaſure ſerviceable to his Church: Now, I ſend
theſe Select Notions after their Fellows; of which, I wiſh you may finde cauſe
to ſay with the Wedding-gueſts at Cana, Thou haſt re­ſerved the beſt wine till
now.

The intent of this Labor is to put ſome good Thoughts (Reader) into thy minde,
which would not otherwiſe, perhaps have tendered them­ſelves [[Page
9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=3) to thee; ſuch, as
I hope may not a little further thee on thy journey to Hea­ven. And if in my
Laboring thitherward, I ſhall, through Gods mercy, be a means of forwarding
any ſoul, but ſome ſteps up that ſteep way, how happy am I?

To which purpoſe, I know no means more effectual, then thoſe Meditations which
conduce to the animation and vigor of Chriſtian pra­ctiſe: Such I have
pro­pounded to my Self, as most behooveful and neceſſary; eſpecially for this
Age, into [[Page 10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=4)
which we are faln; an Age of more brain then heart; and that hath almost lost
Piety in the chaſe of ſome litigious Truths. And ſurely had I known how better
to have placed my hours, I ſhould gladly have changed my task: But, I must
needs ſay, I have found this im­ployment ſo uſeful, and proper, as that I have
looked upon thoſe Polemical Diſ­courſes which have been forced from me, as no
better then meer Excurſions. I wis, it will be long enough, ere we ſhall
wrangle our ſelves into [[Page
11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=4) Heaven: It muſt
be true contrition, pure conſciences, holy affections, heavenly diſ­poſitions,
hearty devotions, ſound Regeneration, Faith working by Love, an humble walking
with GOD that ſhall help us thither; and whatſoever may tend to the advancing
of any of theſe gracious Works in us, is worthy to be dear and preci­ous.

Such paſſages, Reader, if thou ſhalt, according to my hopes, meet with here,
bleſs GOD with me, and im­prove them to the best ad­vantage [[Page
12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=5) of thy Soul: Thus
ſhall our gain be mutual, and our account happy in the day of the Lord Jeſus:
In whom farewel.

## 1\. Select Thoughts, One Century.

### 1.1. I.

IF miracles be ceaſed, yet marvails will never ceaſe. There is no creature in
the world, wherein we may not ſee enough to wonder at; for there is no worm of
the earth, no ſpire of graſs, no leaf, no twig, wherein we may not ſee the
footſteps of a Deity: The beſt viſible Creature is man; now, what man is he
that can [[Page 14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=6)
make but an hair, or a ſtraw, much leſs any ſenſitive crea­ture; ſo as no leſs
then an in­finite power is ſeen in every object that preſents it ſelf to our
eyes; if therefore we look onely upon the outſides of theſe bodily ſubſtances,
and do not ſee God in every thing, we are no better then brutiſh; making uſe
meerly of our ſence without the leaſt im­provement of our faith, or our
reaſon: Contrary then to the opinion of thoſe men, who hold that a wiſe man
ſhould admire nothing, I ſay, that a man truely wiſe and good ſhould admire
every thing, or rather that infiniteneſs of wiſdom and omnipotence which ſhews
it ſelf in every viſible object: Lord what a [[Page
15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=6) beaſt am I that I
have ſuffered mine eyes to be taken up with ſhapes, and colours and
quan­tities, and have not lookt deeper at thee (with awful adoration, and
wonder) in e­very parcel of thy great Crea­tion: Henceforth let me ſee nothing
but thee, and look at all viſible things, but as the meer ſhadows of a
glorious omnipotence.

### 1.2. II.

Our affections are then onely ſafe and right, when they are deduced from God,
and have their riſe from Heaven; then onely can I take comfort of my love,
when I can love my wife, my childe, my friend, my ſelf, my pleaſures, and
whatſoever [[Page 16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=7)
contentments in God; thus I may be ſure not to offend ei­ther in the object,
or meaſure; no man can in God love whom he ſhould not, nor im­moderately love
whom he ſhould: this holy reſpect doth both direct and limit him; and ſhuts up
his delights in the conſcience of a lawful fruition: the like muſt be ſaid of
our joy, and fear, and grief, and what ever other affection; for we cannot
derive our joy from God, if we place it upon any ſinful thing, or if we exceed
in the meaſure of things allowed; we cannot fetch our fear from Heaven, if it
be cowardly, and deſpe­rate, nor our grief, if it be meerly worldly and
heartleſs. And if our affections do be­gin [[Page
17]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=7) from above, they
will ſure­ly end there, cloſing up in that God, who is the Author and orderer
of them; and ſuch as our affections are, ſuch will be the whole diſpoſition of
the ſoul, and the whole carriage of our actions: Theſe are the feet of the
ſoul, and which way the feet walk, the whole man goes; happy is the man that
can be ſo far the maſter of himſelf, as to entertain no affections but ſuch as
he takes upon the rebound from Hea­ven.

### 1.3. III.

Whence is this delicate ſcent in this Roſe, and Violet? It is not from the
root, that ſmells of nothing; not from the ſtalk, that is as ſenceleſs as
[[Page 18]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=8) the root;
not from the earth whence it grows, which con­tributes no more to theſe
flowers, then to the graſs that grows by them; not from the leaf, not from the
bud before it be diſcloſed, which yields no more fra­grance then the leaf, or
ſtalk, or root; yet here I now finde it; neither is it here by any miraculous
way, but in an ordinary courſe of nature; for all Violets and Roſes of this
kinde yield the ſame redo­lence; it cannot be, but that it was potentially in
that root, and ſtem from which the flowers proceed, and there placed, and
thence drawn by that Almighty power which hath given theſe admirable vertues
to ſeveral plants, and [[Page
19]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=8) educes them in
his due ſeaſons to theſe excellent perfections. It is the ſame hand that works
ſpiritually in his elect; out of the ſoyl of the renewed heart, watered with
the dew of Heaven, and warmed with the beams of his Spirit, God can, and in
his own ſeaſon, doth bring forth thoſe ſweet odors of Grace, and holy
diſ­poſitions, which are moſt pleaſing to himſelf; and if thoſe excellencies
be ſo cloſe­ly lodged in their boſoms, that they do not diſcover themſelves at
all times, it ſhould be no more ſtrange to us, then that this Roſe and Violet
are not to be found, but in their own moneths; it is enough that the ſame
vertue is ſtill in the root, [[Page
20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=9) though the flower
be va­niſhed.

### 1.4. IIII.

A man that looks at all things through the conſidera­tion of eternity, makes
no more of a man, then of a flower; that laſts ſome days, he laſts ſome years;
at their period, both fade: Now, what difference is there to be made betwixt
days and years in the thoughts of an eternal duration? Herein therefore I have
a great advantage of a carnal heart; ſuch a one boun­ding his narrow conceits
with the preſent condition, is rea­dy to admire himſelf, and o­thers, for what
they have or are, and is therefore deject­ed upon every miſcarriage: [[Page
21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=9) whereas I behold
my ſelf, or that man, in all his glory, as vaniſhing; onely meaſuring every
mans felicity by the hopes and interreſs which he hath in a bleſſed eternity.

### 1.5. V.

When I am dead and for­gotten, the world will be as it is, the ſame
ſucceſſions and varieties of ſeaſons, the ſame revolutions of Heaven, the ſame
changes of Earth and Sea, the like occur­rents of natural events, and humane
affairs. It is not in my power to alter the courſe of things, or to prevent
what muſt be: What ſhould I do, but quietly take my part of the preſent, and
humbly leave the care of the future to that [[Page
22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=10) all-wiſe
providence, which ordereth all things (even the moſt croſs events) according
to his moſt holy and juſt pur­poſes?

### 1.6. VI.

The Scripture is the Sun, the Church is the Clock, whoſe hand points us to,
and whoſe ſound tells us the hours of the day; the Sun we know to be ſure, and
regularly conſtant in his motion; the Clock as it may fall out, may go too
faſt, or too ſlow; we are wont to look at, and liſten to the Clock to know the
time of the day, but where we finde the variation ſenſible, to be­leeve the
Sun againſt the Clock, not the Clock againſt the Sun. As then we would [[Page
23]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=10) condemn him of
much folly, that ſhould profeſs to truſt the Clock rather then the Sun; ſo we
cannot but juſtly tax the miſcredulity of thoſe who will rather truſt to the
Church then to the Scri­pture.

### 1.7. VII.

What marvailous high re­ſpects hath God given to man above all his other
viſible Creatures! what an houſe hath he put him into! how gloriouſly arched,
how richly pavemented! Wherefore ſerves all the furniture of Heaven and Earth,
but for his uſe? What delicate proviſi­on hath that bountiful hand made for
his palate, both of meats and liquors, by Land [[Page
24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=11) and Sea? What
rich orna­ments hath he laid up for him in his wardrobe of earth and waters?
and wherefore ſerves the various muſick of Birds, but to pleaſe his ear? For,
as for the brute Creatures, all harmony to them is but as ſilence. Wherefore
ſerves the excellent variety of Flow­ers, ſurpaſſing Solomon in all his glory,
but to pleaſe his eie? meer graſs is more acceptable to Beaſts. Yea, what
Crea­ture but he is capable to ſur­vey Gods wonders in the deep? to
contemplate the great fabrick of the Heavens? to obſerve the glorious bodies,
and regular motions of the Sun, Moon, Stars; and (which exceeds all
conceiveable mercies,) who but [[Page
25]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=11) he is capable of
that celeſtial Glory, which is within that beautiful contignation? to be a
companion of the bleſſed Angels, yea to be a limb of the myſtical Body of the
eternal Son of God, and to partake with him of his everlaſting and
incomprehenſible glory? Lord, what is man that thou art thus mindful of him?
and how utterly unworthy are we even of common mercies, if we re­turn not to
our God, more advantage of glory, then thoſe poor creatures that were made for
us, and which cannot in nature be ſenſible of his favors?

### 1.8. VIII.

How plain is it that all ſen­ſitive things are ordered by an [[Page
26]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=12) inſtinct from
their Maker? He that gives them being, puts into them their ſeveral
diſpo­ſitions, inclinations, facul­ties, operations. If we look to Birds; the
Mavis, the Black­bird, the Red-breſt have throats tuneable to any note, as we
daily ſee they may be taught ſtrains utterly vary­ing from their natural
tones, yet they all naturally have the ſame ſongs and accents different from
each other, and fully according to their own kinde; ſo as every Mavis hath the
ſame ditty with his fel­lows: If we mark the build­ing of their neſts, each
kinde obſerves its own faſhion and materials, ſome clay, others moſs, hair,
ſticks; yea if their very motions and reſt­ings, [[Page
27]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=12) they are conform
to their own feather, different from others. If to Beaſts, they all untaught
obſerve the faſhi­ons of their ſeveral kindes. Ga­len obſerves that when he
was diſſecting a She-goat big with young, a Kid then ready to be yeaned ſtarts
out, and walks up and down the room, and there being in the ſame place, ſet
ſeveral veſſels of oyl, hony, water, milk, the new faln Kid ſmells at them
all, and re­fuſing the reſt falls to lapping of the milk; whereupon he juſtly
infers, that nature ſtays not for a Teacher. Nei­ther is it other in Flies,
and all ſorts of the meaneſt vermine, all Bees build alike, and order the
Common-wealth of their [[Page
28]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=13) hive in one
maner; all Ants keep their own way in their houſing, journeys, proviſi­ons;
all Spiders do as per­fectly and uniformly weave their web, as if they had
been Apprentiſes to the trade, the ſame inſtincts are ſeen alſo in the
rational Creatures, al­though in moſt caſes overru­led by their higher
facul­ties.

What an infinite provi­dence then is this we live un­der, that hath
diſtributed to every creature, as a ſeveral form, ſo ſeveral inclinations,
qualities, motions, proper to to their own kinde, and diffe­rent from other;
and keeps them in this conſtant unifor­mity, and variety, for the de­light and
contentment of [[Page
29]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=13) man! O God, that
I could be capable of enough won­dring at thy great works! that I could be
enough hum­bled under the ſenſe of my own incapacity, that I could give thee
ſo much more glo­ry, as I finde more vileneſs in my ſelf.

### 1.9. IX.

When I ſaw my precious watch (now through an un­happy fall grown irregular)
taken aſunder, and lying ſcat­tered upon the workmans ſhop-board; ſo as here
lay a wheel, there the balance, here one gimmer, there another, ſtraight my
ignorance was ready to think, when and how will all theſe ever peece together
again in their former [[Page
30]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=14) order? But when
the skilful Artiſan had taken it a while in hand, and curiouſly pin­ed the
joynts, it now began to return to its wonted ſhape, and conſtant motion, as if
it had never been diſordered: How could I chuſe but ſee in this, the juſt
embleme of a diſtempered Church and State? wherein if all ſeem disjoynted, and
every wheel laid aſide by it ſelf, ſo as an unknowing beholder would diſpair
of a redreſs, yet if it ſhall pleaſe the great Artiſt of Heaven to put his
hand unto it, how ſoon might it return to an happy reſetlement? Even ſo,
bleſſed Lord, for thy great mercies ſake make up the breaches of thy Sion, &
repair the ruines of thy Jeruſalem

[[Page 31]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=14)

### 1.10. X

We are, and we are not, all one mans children: Our bodies once met in one
root, but our mindes and diſpoſiti­ons do ſo differ, as if we had never been
of kin: one man is ſo gentle and plauſible that he would fain pleaſe all;
ano­ther is ſo churliſh and dogged that he cares not whom he diſpleaſes, and
hardly can be well pleaſed with himſelf: One ſo ſparing and pinching that he
grudges himſelf ne­ceſſaries, another ſo vainly laviſh, that he cares not how
he ſquanders his eſtate: one is tenderly pitiful, another mercileſly cruel;
one religi­ouſly devout, another wildly profane; one cowardly fear­ful, [[Page
32]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=15) another
deſperately cou­ragious: one jovially cheer­ful and lightſome, another ſad and
dumpiſh, even to ſtu­pidity: one petulant and wan­ton, another auſterely
conti­nent; one humble and low-conceited of rich indow­ments, another ſwoln
big with a little. He did never read men to purpoſe that is too much troubled
with the harſh and unpleaſing contra­riety of humors, which he meets with in
the world; and he ſhall be too unthankful to God, that finding himſelf better
compoſed then others, knows not whither to aſcribe it; and too neglective of
him­ſelf, that finding his own diſtempered, labors not to re­ctifie it.

[[Page 33]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=15)

### 1.11. XI.

Nature, Law, and Grace divide all the Ages of the world; now as it is in man
(who is a leſſer world) that in every day there is a reſem­blance of his whole
life; the morning is his childehood, the mid-day his youth, the evening his
old age; ſo is it in this greater World; the dim break of day was the ſtate of
nature, and this was the non­age of the world, wherein the light of knowledg,
both of humane and divine things was but weak and obſcure. The Sun was riſen
higher in the ſtate of the Law, but yet not without thick miſts and ſhad­ows,
till the high-noon of that true Sun of Righteouſ­neſs, [[Page
34]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=16) who perſonally
ſhone forth to the world; upon whoſe vertical point began the age of Grace,
that ſtill continues, which is the clear afternoon, and full vigour of the
World, though now in its ſenſible declination: after this, there ſhall be no
time, but eternity. Theſe then are they, which both the Pro­phets and Apoſtles
have ſtiled the laſt days; not onely in re­ſpect of the times that went before
them, but in regard that no time ſhall follow them: neither have we reaſon to
bogle at the large latitude of ſixteen hundred years; there was neither of the
two other periods of age, but were longer then this: Be­ſides, how ever,
childehood [[Page
35]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=16) and youth have
their fixed terms which they ordinarily paſs not, yet the duration of old age
is indefinite: We have in our youth known ſome gray-heads that have con­tinued
vigorous, till we have lived to match them in the colour of their livery.

And if this be (as it is) the Evening of the World, do we not ſee much
difference of time in the ſhutting in of the Light? A Summers Evening, is a
Winters day; but if theſe were to the Apoſtles the laſt days, how can they be
other then in the laſt hour, yea, the laſt minute unto us?

Why do we not put our ſelves into a conſtant expecta­tion of the end of all
things, and ſet our ſelves in a meet [[Page
36]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=17) poſture for the
receit of our returning Saviour?

### 1.12. XII.

It is a feeling and experi­mental expreſſion that the Apoſtle gives of a
Chriſtian,2 Cor. 4. 18. That he looks not on the things which are ſeen; not
that his eyes are ſo dim as old Iſaacs, that he cannot diſcern them, or that
his inward ſenſes are ſo ſtupified, that he cannot judg of their true value:
but that, taking an exact view of theſe earthly things, he diſ­cries ſo much
vanity in them, as that he findes them not worthy to be lookt at with the full
bent of his deſires; like as it is not the meer ſight of a ſtrange beauty that
is forbidden (for a man may as [[Page
37]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=17) well look upon a
fair face, as upon a good picture) but a ſetled and fixed aſpect, that feeds
the eye, and draws the heart to a ſinful concupi­ſcence: Thus doth not the
Chriſtian look upon the things that are ſeen, as making them the full ſcope,
and aym of his deſires and affections: So far he takes notice of them, as to
make his beſt (that is, lawful and moderate) uſe of them; not ſo, as to make
them the chief object of his contemplation, the main drift of his cares. It is
well obſerved by S. Baſil, that as there are two contrary ways, the broad, and
the nar­row; ſo there are two guides, as contrary, Senſe and Faith: Senſe
preſents to us the plea­ſing [[Page
38]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=18) delights of this
world, on the one ſide; on the other, the preſent afflictions and
per­ſecutions that attend a good profeſſion: Faith lays before us the glorious
things of a future life, and the endleſs miſeries and torments abid­ing for
ſinful ſouls in the world to come: Now, it is not for every one to deny al
credit to his ſenſe, alluring him with all preſent, and viſible plea­ſures,
and diſcouraging him with the terror & pain of pre­ſent and viſible
afflictions, and to yield himſelf hood-winkt, to be led by Faith,
forepromi­ſing onely better things afar off, and foreadmoniſhing him of
dangers, future and inviſi­ble. Faith onely is that he­roical vertue, which
makes a [[Page 39]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=18)
man with an holy contempt to overlook all the pleaſing baits of the world, and
with a brave courage and fortitude to deſpiſe all the menaces, and painful
inflictions of his preſent fury: This works our eyes, not to look upon the
things which we cannot but ſee, the preſent ſhews of the world, whether
alluring, or terrifying: Had Lot but lookt back on Sodom; the pleaſant plain
of Sodom, that lay like the Garden of God behinde his back, he had never
eſcaped into the mountain: Had the glorious Protomartyr fixed his eyes onely
upon his perſecu­tors, his heart could not but have failed, to ſee the fire in
their faces, the ſparkling of their eyes, the grinding of [[Page
40]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=19) their teeth, the
bending of their brows, the ſtopping of their ears, their furious run­ing upon
him, their violent halings and draggings; and laſtly, a whole volly of ſtones
diſcharged mortally upon him; he had been utterly daunted with ſuch an
impe­tuoſity of death: But he, as not ſeeing any of this pomp, and oſtentation
of horror, looks up ſtedfaſtly to Heaven, and there ſees (that which might
well make him blinde to all other viſible objects) the Heavens open, and Jeſus
ſtanding at the right hand of God; and upon this ſight, he ſhut up his eyes,
and ſlept. The true Chriſtian then, hath with holy Job, made a cove­nant with
his eyes, not to look [[Page
41]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=19) upon, either the
cruel inſolen­cies of the raging world with fear and dejectedneſs, or on the
tempting vanities of the world with amorous glances; but with a ſober and
conſtant reſolution entertains the ob­jects of both kindes. Very juſtly did
Tertullian jeer that Heathen Philoſopher, who pulled out his eyes to avoyd
concupiſcence; and can tell him, that a Chriſtian can hold his eyes, and yet
behold Beau­ty unbewitched; and can be at once open-eyed to nature, and blinde
to luſt: and what the Apoſtle ſaid of the Uſe, he can practiſe of the ſight of
the world, and earthly objects; he can ſo behold them, as if he beheld them
not. How oft have we, in a deep ſtudy fixed [[Page
42]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=20) our eyes upon
that, which we, the while thought not upon, neither perceived that we ſaw? So
doth the Chriſtian to theſe worldly glories, plea­ſures, profits, whiles his
minde and affections are on the things above, Coloſ. 3. 1, 2. where Chriſt
ſitteth on the right hand of God. There, Lord, let me behold thoſe things
which cannot yet be ſeen, but ſhall, once, in the ſight of them make me
bleſs­ed: And let me not look on the things that are ſeen; for the things that
are ſeen are temporary, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.

### 1.13. XIII.

There is not more ſtrange­neſs then ſignificance in that charge of the
Apoſtle, That [[Page
43]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=20) we ſhould put on
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Rom. 13. 14. The ſoul is (as it were) a body;Gal. 3.
27. not really and properly ſo, according to the groſs error of Tertullian;
but by way of alluſion: This body of the ſoul, then, may not be naked, but
muſt be clad; as our firſt parents were aſhamed of their bodily nakedneſs,
(and ſo ſtill are all their (not ſavage) poſterity,) ſo may we of our
ſpiritual. Every ſinner is naked; thoſe rags that he hath, are ſo far from
hiding his nakedneſs, that they are part of it; his faireſt moralities are but
glit­tering ſins, and his ſins are his nakedneſs:Exod. 32. 25. Aaron had made
Iſrael naked to their ſhame; not ſo much in that they were ſtripped of their
earings, as [[Page
44]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=21) that they were
enwrapped in the ſin of idolatry. No mar­vel if we run away, and hide us from
the preſence of God, as our firſt parents did, whiles we are guilty to our
ſelves of our Spiritual deformity: As then we are bodily naked, when we come
into the world, ſo we are ſpiritually naked whiles we are of the world;
neither can it be either ſafe, or comely for us, till we be covered: There is
no clothing can fit the ſoul but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; all o­ther robes in
the wardrobe of Earth, or Heaven, are too ſhort, too ſtraight; like thoſe
which the ſcorn of Hanun put upon Davids meſſengers, reaching but to the hams;
for though the ſoul of man be [[Page
45]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=21) finite, the ſin
of the ſoul is ſcarce ſo; and that ſin muſt be covered, elſe there can be no
ſafety for the ſoul, accord­ing to that of the Pſalmiſt: Pſal. 32. 1. Bleſſed
is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is cover­ed: None therefore
but the robes of an infinite Righte­ouſneſs, can cover the ſoul ſo wofully
dreſſed; none there­fore but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for
ever, can cover the ſoul, that it may not appear unrigh­teous; or can cleanſe
the ſoul that it may not be unrighte­ous; and cleanſed it muſt be, ere the
Lord Jeſus can be put on: We ſhall wrong his perfit holineſs, if we think we
can ſlip him on, as a caſe, over our beaſtly rags: It is with [[Page
46]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=22) us, as with
Joſhua the high Prieſt;Zech. 3. 4. The filthy garments muſt firſt be taken
off, and then the Lord ſhall ſay unto us: Behold, I have cauſed thine iniquity
to paſs from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of rayment.

We put on a garment when we apply it all over to our body; ſo as that part
which is clothed, appears not, but is defended from the air, and from the eye:
if we have truely put on the Lord Jeſus, nothing of ours is ſeen, but Chriſt
is all in all, to us; al­though this application goes yet deeper; for we ſo
put him on, that we not onely put our ſelves into him, but alſo put him into
our ſelves, by a mu­tual kinde of Spiritual incor­poration.

[[Page 47]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=22) We put
him on then, upon our Intellectual parts, by knowing him, by beleeving on him.
(This is eternal life to know thee, and whom thou haſt ſent, ſaith our
Saviour;) and for Faith, no grace doth ſo ſenſibly apprehend him, and make him
ſo feelingly ours.

We put him on upon our wills, and affections, when we take pleaſure in him,
when we love him, delight in him, and prefer him to our chiefeſt joy.

Thus do we put him on; as our Lord, in our humble and dutiful ſubjection; as
our Jeſus, in our faithful affiance; as Chriſt, the anointed of God, to be our
King, in all holy obedience; our Prieſt, in our willing conſecration [[Page
48]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=23) to him; our
Prophet, in our cheerful readineſs to be in­ſtructed by him: How happy are we,
if we be thus decked; we prank up theſe poor carcaſſes of ours gaily, with no
ſmall expence; and when we have done, the ſtuff, or the faſhion, or both,
wears out to nothing: But, here is a garment that will never be out of
faſhion; Jeſus Chriſt yeſterday, and to day, and the ſame for ever; yea, the
ſame to us: here, we put him on in Grace, there, in eternal Glory.

The Iſraelites were fourty years in the wilderneſs,Deut. 16. yet their ſhooes
not worn, their apparel not impaired; but this attire ſhall not onely hold
good in the time of our wan­dring [[Page
49]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=23) in this deſart,
but after we are come into the Canaan of glory, and is beſt at laſt. Wherefore
do we put on our choiſeſt attire on ſome high days, but to teſtifie the
cheer­fulneſs of our hearts:Eccleſ. 9. 7, 8. Let thy garment be white, ſaith
the Preacher, for now God accept­eth thy works: Mephiboſheth changed not his
raiment ſince David went out, as one that would have the ſorrow of his heart
ſeen in the neglect of his clothes; although many a one under a gay coat hath
an heavy heart, but this attire doth not onely teſtifie, but make cheerfulneſs
in the ſoul; Thou haſt given me more joy of heart, Pſal. 4. 7. then they had
in the time that their corn and their wine increaſed; and, In thy preſence
[[Page 50]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=24) is the
fulneſs of joy; what can this apparel of ours do but keep us from a blaſt, or
a ſhowre? it is ſo far from ſafeguarding the ſoul, that it many times wounds
it, and that to the death. It was one of the main quarrels againſt the rich
glutton, that he was every day clothed in purple, and byſs: How many ſouls
ſhall once wiſh that their bodies had been ever either naked,Luk. 16. 19. or
clad with hair­cloth? But this aray, as it is infinitely rich and beautiful,
ſo it is as ſurely defenſative of the ſoul; and is no leſs then armor of proof
againſt all aſſaults,Epheſ. 6. all miſeries.

What a deal of coſt and pains do we beſtow upon theſe wretched bodies of
[[Page 51]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=24) ours,
onely to make them pleaſing and lovely to the eye of ſome beholders, as
miſe­rable, perhaps, as our ſelves; and yet when we have all done, we are (it
may be) no better then hard-favord, and unhandſome creatures, and contemptible
in thoſe eyes from whom we deſired moſt approbation; Jezebel, for all her
licking, is caſt out of the window, and troden to dirt in the ſtreets: But
this robe we can not wear, and not be amiable in the eyes of the holieſt:Cant.
1. 15. Behold thou art fair, my beloved; behold thou art fair, and there is no
ſpot in thee: Lo, in this caſe, the apparel makes the man; neither is it in
the power of any ſpiritual deformity, to make us other [[Page
52]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=25) then lovely, in
the ſight of our God, whiles we have Chriſt put on upon us. What ever
therefore become of the out­ward man, let it be my care that my ſoul be veſted
with my Lord Jeſus; ſo ſhall I be ſure, to be ſafe, rich, amiable here, and
hereafter glorious.

It was part of our Saviours charge upon the mount, Take no care what to put
on; but it muſt be the main care of our lives, how to put on Chriſt upon our
ſouls: This is the prime ſtole wherewith the fa­ther of the Prodigal, graceth
his returned ſon; the heaven of heavens is not worth ſuch another; when I have
once got this on my back, I ſhall ſay, though in a contrary ſenſe, with the
Spouſe in the [[Page
53]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=25) Canticles: Cant.
5. 3. I have put on my coat, how ſhall I put it off? I have waſhed my feet,
how ſhall I defile them?

### 1.14. XIIII.

With how devout paſſion doth the Pſalmiſt call to all the works of the
Almighty to praiſe him; as well ſuppoſing, that every creature (even thoſe
that have no tongues to ſpeak for themſelves) yet have a tongue to praiſe
their Maker;Pſal. 19. 1. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the
firmament ſheweth his handy work; Day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto
night ſheweth know­ledg: There is no ſpeech nor language, where their voyce is
not heard; neither is the very earth defective in this duty: [[Page
54]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=26) Every plant
ſayes, look on me, and acknowledg, the life, co­lour, form, ſmell, fruit,
force that I have from the power of my Creator: every worm and flie ſayes,
look on me, and give God the praiſe of my living, ſenſe, and motion: every
bird ſayes; hear me, and praiſe that God who hath given me theſe various
feathers, and taught me theſe ſeveral notes: every beaſt, whiles he bellows,
bleats, brays, barks, roars, ſayes, It is God that hath given me this ſhape,
this ſound; yea the very mute fiſhes, are in their very ſilence, vocal, in
magni­fying the infinite wiſdom and power of him that made them, and placed
them in thoſe watery habitations; [[Page
55]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=26) Let every thing
that hath breath ſaith the Pſalmiſt,Pſa. ult. ult. praiſe the Lord. Yea the
very winds whiſtle, and the ſea roars out the praiſe of the Almighty, who both
raiſes, and allays them at pleaſure; what a ſhame were it for man, to whom
alone God hath given an underſtanding heart, a nimble tongue, and articulate
language, wherein he can ex­preſs his rational thoughts, to be wanting to this
ſo univer­ſal devotion? and to be as in­ſenſible of the great works of God, as
the ground that he treads upon? If others ſhall be thus unthankfully dumb, Yet
praiſe thou the Lord, Pſal. 103. 1. 2. O my ſoul, and all that is within me
bleſs his holy name; Pſa. 146. 1, 2. whiles I live will I praiſe the Lord; I
will ſing [[Page 56]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=27)
praiſes to my God whileſt I have any being. But alas Lord thou knoweſt, I
cannot ſo much as will to praiſe thee, without thee; do thou fill my heart
with holy deſires, and my mouth with ſongs of thankſ­giving.

### 1.15. XV.

It may ſeem a ſtrange er­rand upon which our Saviour tells us he came into the
world;Luk. 12. 49. I am come to ſend fire on the earth: When the two fervent
Diſciples would have had fire ſent down from Hea­ven upon but a Samaritan
Village, our Saviour rebuked them, and told them they knew not of what ſpirit
they were; yet here, he makes it his own buſineſs, to ſend fire [[Page
57]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=27) on the earth:
Alas (may we think) we have fire too much already; how happy were it rather,
if the fire which is kindled in the world, were well quenched; and what is the
main drift of the Prince of darkneſs but fire? If not to ſend fire down from
Heaven, upon the inhabitants of the earth; yet, to ſend the inha­bitants of
the earth down to the fire of hell? As then we finde divers kindes of material
fire, Celeſtial, Elementary, Domeſtique, Artificial, Na­tural; ſo there is no
leſs varie­ty of ſpiritual fires: It was in fiery, cloven, tongues, where­in
the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon the Apoſtles,Acts 2. in their Pentecoſt;Joh. 16.
7. and even this fire did our Saviour come to ſend [[Page
58]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=28) down on the
earth: Thy word was in mee as fire,Jer. 5. 14. ſaith the Prophet; and did not
our harts burn within us (ſaid the two Diſciples,Luk. 23. 32. in their walk to
Emaus) whiles he talked with us; This fire he alſo came to ſend: Heavenly
Love, and holy Zeal are fire;Cant. 8 7. Many waters cannot quench love. My
zeal hath conſumed me, Pſal. 119. 139. ſaith the Pſalmiſt: and theſe fires our
Saviour came to ſend into the hearts of men; holy thoughts are no other then
the beams of celeſtial fire,Pſal. 39 4. My heart was hot within me; whiles I
was muſing, the fire burned, and theſe, we know he ſends:Pſal. 104. 4. He
maketh his An­gels ſpirits, Heb. 1. 7. and his miniſters a flame of fire:
Theſe he ſends forth to the earth to miniſter [[Page
59]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=28) for them that
ſhall be heirs of of ſalvation: Heb. 1. 14. Beſides theſe, afflictions and
perſecutions are fire: We have paſſed through fire and water:1 Pet. 4. 12.
Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal, which is to try you,
as if ſome ſtrange thing had happened to you: and even theſe are of his
ſending;Lament. 4. 11. The Lord hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath
devoured the foundations there­of. There is no evil in the city, but the Lord
hath done it: The Lord hath done that which he had deviſed, Lam. 2. 17. he
hath thrown down, and not pitied.

But this expreſſion of our Saviour goes yet deeper, and alludes to the effect
of Sepa­ration, which follows upon the fire of our tryal: When the lump of Oar
is put into the [[Page
60]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=29) furnace, the
fire tryes the pure mettal from the droſs, and makes an actual diviſion of the
one from the other; ſo doth Chriſt by his Word, and Spirit; even he that is
the Prince and God of Peace, comes to ſet diviſion in the world. Surely, there
are holy quarrels worthy of his en­gagement; for, as the fleſh luſteth and
warreth againſt the ſpirit, ſo the ſpirit fighteth againſt the fleſh; and this
du­el may well beſeem God for the Author, and the Son of God for the ſetter of
it: theſe ſecond blows make an happy fray.

Nothing is more properly compared then diſcord to fire; this,Judges 9. 20.
Chriſt (the firſt thing he does) ſets in every heart: there [[Page
61]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=29) is all
quietneſs, ſecure eaſe, and ſelf-contentment in the ſoul, till Chriſt come
there: How ſhould it be other, when Satan ſways all without reſiſt­ance? but
when once Chriſt offers to enter, there are ſtraight civil wars in the ſoul
betwixt the old man, and the new; and it fares with the heart, as with an
houſe di­vided in it ſelf, wherein the husband and the wife are at variance;
nothing is to be heard, but unquiet janglings, open brawlings, ſecret
oppo­ſition; the houſhold takes part, and profeſſes a mutual vexation: This
Spiritual ſelf-diviſion, where ever it is, though it be troubleſom, yet it is
cordial; it puts the ſoul into the ſtate of Rebecca [...]s [[Page
62]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=30) womb; which
barren, yield­ed no pain; but when an Eſau and Jacob were conceived, and
ſtrugling within, yielded for the time, no eaſe; yet this was that which
cauſed her juſt joy, That ſhe had not ſo much children, as nations in her
womb; even ſo the trou­ble of this inward conflict is abundantly requited with
the joy of this aſſurance, That now Chriſt is come into our ſoul, and is
working his own deſired ends, in, and upon us. Let vain and ſenſual hearts
pleaſe themſelves in their in­ward peace and calmneſs; there cannot be a
greater ſigne of graceleſneſs and disfavor of God; When they ſhall ſay Peace,
Peace, then ſhall come upon them ſudden deſtructi­on: [[Page
63]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=30) The old word
was, No ſafety in War; here it is con­trary, It is this inteſtine war of the
heart, with fire and ſword to our corruptions, that muſt bring us true reſt
for the preſent, and hereafter eternal peace and happineſs. Now, Lord, ſince
it is thy de­ſire that this fire ſhould be kindled, kindle thou and en­flame
my heart with a fervent deſire, and endeavor that this thy deſire may be
accom­pliſhed in me: Set me at war with my ſelf, that I may be at peace with
thee.

### 1.16. XVI.

In all that we have to do with God, he juſtly requires and expects from us, an
awful diſpoſition of heart towards [[Page
64]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=31) his
infiniteneſs; hereupon it was that he delivered his Law in thunder, fire,
ſmoke, and all dreadful magnificence; And when upon the ſame day, he would
ſend down his Spirit, for the propagation of the Goſpel, it was done with an
aſtoniſhing Majeſty; with a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty wind,
and with the apparition of cloven and fiery tongues:Acts 2. 2, 12. And as it
was thus in the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt in the miraculous gifts; ſo it is in
the ſanctify­ing Graces: Seldom ever doth God by them ſeize upon the heart,
but with a vehe­ment concuſſion going be­fore: That of St Pauls con­verſion,
was extraordinary and miraculous, but in ſome [[Page
65]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=31) degree it is
thus, in every ſoul; We are ſtruck down firſt, and are made ſenſible of our
ſpi­ritual blindneſs, ere our full call be accompliſhed; as it was with Elijah
in the Mount of Horeb, There came firſt a ſtrong wind, that tore the Rocks,
and Mountains, and after that, an earth-quake, then a fire, before the ſtill
ſmall voyce; ſo it is uſually in our breſts, ere the comfort­able voyce of
Gods Spirit ſpeak to our hearts, there muſt be ſome bluſtrings, and flaſhes of
the Law: It is our honor, and his favor, that we are allowed to love God; it
is our duty to fear him: We may be too familiar in our love, we cannot be too
aw­ful in our fear.

[[Page 66]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=32)

### 1.17. XVII.

All valuations of theſe out­ward things are arbitrary, ac­cording to the
opinion of their pleaſure, or their rarity, or the neceſſity of their uſe: Did
not mens mindes ſet a price upon mettals, what were they better then ſome
other entrails of the earth, or one better then other? If by publike law the
mint were or­dained to be onely ſupplyed by our ſtanneries, how cur­rantly
would they paſs for more precious then ſilver mines? To an Indian, a bracelet
of worthleſs Beads is eſtimated above his Gold; an hungry Eſau values a meſs
of pottage above his birth­right: In the ſiege of Samaria [[Page
67]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=32) an Aſſes head
was ſold for fourſcore peeces of ſilver; and a Kab of Doves dung for five
peeces:2 Kings 6. 25. We have heard that thoſe of Angola have valued a Dog at
the price of many ſlaves. In all theſe earthly commodities, the market riſes,
and falls accord­ing to conceit, and occaſion; neither is there any
intrinſe­cal, and ſetled worth in any of them; onely Spiritual things, as
Vertue and Grace are good in themſelves; and ſo carry their infinite value in
them, that they make their owner abſolutely rich, and happy: When therefore I
ſee a rich man hugging his bags, and admiring his wealth, I look upon that man
with pity, as knowing the poorneſs of [[Page
68]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=33) that pelf
wherein he placeth his felicity; neither can I be­hold him with other eyes,
then thoſe, wherewith, a diſ­creet European ſees a ſavage Indian priding
himſelf in thoſe trifles, which our chil­dren have learned to con­temn: On the
other ſide when I ſee a man rich in the endow­ments of minde, well-fraught
with knowledg, eminent in goodneſs, and truly gracious, I ſhall riſe up to
that man (how homely ſo ever his out­ſide be) as the moſt precious and
excellent peece which this world can afford.

### 1.18. XVIII.

Should I but ſee an Angel, I ſhould look (with Manoah) to dye no other death
then the [[Page 69]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=33)
ſight of that glory; and yet even that Angel is fain to hide his face, as not
able to behold the infinite Majeſty of God his Creator: When Moſes did but
talk with God in the Mount, for fourty days, his face did ſo ſhine, that the
Iſraelites could not look upon the luſtre of his countenance, even the very
preſence of the Divine Majeſty not onely hath, but communicates glo­ry: Lord,
that I could ſee but ſome glimpſe of the re­flection of thoſe glorious beams
of thine upon my ſoul; how happy ſhould I be in this viſion, whoſe next degree
is perfectly beatifical.

### 1.19. XIX.

As good, ſo evil is apt to [[Page
70]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=34) be communicative
of it ſelf; and this ſo much more, as it meets with ſubjects more capable of
evil then good; the breath of a plague-ſick man taints the air round about
him; yea, the very ſight of blear eyes infects the ſound; and one yawning
mouth ſtretcheth many jaws: How many have we known, that have been innocent in
their retiredneſs, miſerably de­baucht with leud converſati­on? Next to being
good, is, to conſort with the vertuous; It is the moſt merciful im­provement
of an holy power to ſeparate the precious from the vile; it is the higheſt
praiſe of a conſtant goodneſs, for a Lot to be righteous in the midſt of
Sodom.

### 1.20. XX.

We are all apt to put off the blame of our miſcarriages from our ſelves: Even
in para­diſe we did ſo: It was the wo­man, ſaith Adam, it was the Serpent,
ſaith the woman: How have we heard fond gameſters caſt the blame of their ill
luck upon the ſtanders by, which intermedled no­thing but by a ſilent
eye­ſight: So the idolatrous Pagans of old, though flagitiouſly wicked, yet
could impute their publike judgments to none but the Chriſtians, whoſe onely
innocence was their protection from utter ruine; So fooliſhly partial doth our
ſelf-love render us to our own demerits, that all are [[Page
72]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=35) guilty ſave our
ſelves: Yea, rather then we will want ſhifts, our very ſtars ſhall be blamed;
which are no more acceſſary to our harms, then our eyes are to the Eclipſes of
their moſt eminent Lights. As on the contrary, we are ready to arrogate unto
our ſelves thoſe bleſſings, which the meer bounty of Divine Providence hath
caſt upon us; whereto we could not contribute ſo much as an hand to receive
them, but by the mercy of the giver: It cannot be well with me, till I have
learned to correct this palpable injuſtice in both; challenging to my ſelf all
my errors, and guilt of ſufferings, and yielding to God the praiſe his own
[[Page 73]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=35) free and
gracious bene­ficence.

### 1.21. XXI.

How profitable and bene­ficial a thing is affliction; e­ſpecially to ſome
diſpoſitions more then other: I ſee ſome trees that will not thrive, un­leſs
their roots be laid bare; unleſs (beſides pruning) their bodies be gaſhed and
ſliced; others, that are too luxuri­ant, except divers of their bloſſoms be
ſeaſonably pulld off, yield nothing: I ſee too rank corn, if it be not timely
eaten down, may yield ſome­thing to the barn, but little to the granary: I ſee
ſome full bodies, that can enjoy no health without ſtrong evacu­ations, blood-
lettings, fonti­nels; [[Page
74]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=36) ſuch is the
condition of our ſpiritual part: It is a rare ſoul that can be kept in any
conſtant order without theſe ſmarting remedies; I confeſs mine cannot: How
wilde had I run, if the rod had not been over me? Every man can ſay he thanks
God for eaſe; for me, I bleſs God for my trou­bles.

### 1.22. XXII.

When I conſider what an inſenſible Atome man is, in compariſon of the whole
body of the Earth; and what a meer Center-point the Earth is, in compariſon of
the vaſt circumference of Hea­ven; and what an almoſt-in­finite diſtance there
is be­twixt this point of Earth, and [[Page
75]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=36) that large
circle of the Fir­mament; and therewithal think of the innumerable number, and
immenſe great­neſs of thoſe heavenly Lumi­naries: I cannot but appre­hend how
improbable it is, that thoſe Stars ſhould, at ſuch a diſtance, diſtinguiſh
be­twixt one man, and another; betwixt one limb of the ſame body, and another;
betwixt one ſpot of Earth, and ano­ther; and in ſo great a mix­ture, and
confuſion of influ­ences, ſhould give any diſtinct intimation of particular
e­vents in nature; and much more of meer contingencies of arbitrary affairs.
As for the Moon, by reaſon of her vicinity to the Earth, and ſenſible
predominance over [[Page
76]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=37) moyſture; and
for the Sun, the great magazin of Light and Heat, I acknowledg their powerful
(but unpartial) ope­rations upon this whole globe of Earth and Waters, and
every part of it, not without juſt wonder and aſtoniſh­ment; the other Stars
may have their ſeveral vertues and effects, but their marvelous remoteneſs,
and my un­diſcernable nothingneſs, may ſeem to forbid any certain intelligence
of their diſtinct workings upon me: But whe­ther theſe glorious Lights give,
or take any notice of ſuch an imperceptible mite as I; ſure I am, there is
great reaſon I ſhould take notice of them; of their beauteous luſtre, of their
wonderful [[Page 77]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=37)
magnitude, of their regular motion; and be tranſported with admiration of that
om­nipotent power, wiſdom, pro­vidence, which created this goodly and mighty
hoſt of Heaven, and guides them in their conſtant march, without the leaſt
deviation from their firſt ſetting out, to the laſt moment of their final
con­flagration. O the narrowneſs of my wretched heart, that affords not room
enough for wonder at that which I can­not but ſee!

### 1.23. XXIII.

It becomes not us to be niggardly where our Saviour intends bounty: How glad
ſhould we be rather to ampli­ate the benefit of the great [[Page
78]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=38) Work of our
Redeemer? but ſurely, I cannot ſee upon what warrant that favor is grounded,
that enlargeth the fruit of Chriſts redemption, to the Angels: the good needed
it not, the evil were not capable of it; onely man­kinde was captiv'd, and
re­deemable by that invaluable ranſom.

Doubtleſs thoſe bleſſed Spirits have their part in the joy and gratulation of
the in­finite mercy of our deliver­ance; for if they rejoyce at the converſion
of one ſinner, what triumph do we think there is in Heaven at the Uni­verſal
Redemption of all be­leevers? The propriety of this favor hath reaſon to
in­gage us ſo much the more: [[Page
79]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=38) Lord, thy mercy
is free, and boundleſs; thou wouldſt paſs by the lapſed Angels, and leave them
in their ſin, and their chains; and onely reſcue miſerable man out of their
Hell. O for an heart that might be in ſome meaſure anſwerable to ſo infinite
mer­cy; and that might be no leſs captiv'd to thy love, then it is freed by
thy Redemption.

### 1.24. XXIIII.

Men do commonly wrong themſelves with a groundleſs expectation of good;
fore­promiſing to themſelves all fair terms in their proceed­ings, and all
happy ſucceſs in the iſſue; boding nothing to themſelves but what they wiſh;
even the man after [[Page
80]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=39) Gods own heart
could ſay, In my proſperity I ſaid, Pſal. 30. 6. tuſh, I ſhall never be
removed; where­in their miſreckoning makes their diſappointment ſo much the
more grievous: Had not David made ſuch account of the ſtrength and ſtability
of his Mountain, it could not have ſo much troubled him to have it levell'd
with the Plain; on the contrary, the evils which we look for, fall ſo much the
leſs heavily, by how much we are fore-pre­pared for their entertainment; what
ever by-accidents I may meet withal beſides, I have two fixed matches that I
muſt inevitably incounter with, Age, and Death; the one is attended with many
inconve­niences, the other with much [[Page
81]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=39) horror: let me
not flatter my ſelf with hopes of jollity, and eaſe. My comforts for Hea­ven
ſhall (I truſt) never fail me; but for the preſent world, it ſhall be well for
me, if I can without too much difficulty ſcramble out of the neceſſary
miſeries of life; and without too much ſorrow crawl to my grave.

### 1.25. XXV.

Heaven hath many tongues that talk of it, more eyes to behold it, but few
hearts that rightly affect it: Ask any Chriſtian (eſpecially) whom ye ſhall
meet with; he will tell you, thither he ſhapes his courſe; there he hath
pitcht his hopes, and would think himſelf highly [[Page
82]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=40) wronged by that
man, who ſhould make doubt of either his intereſt or ſpeed: But, if we ſhall
caſt our eyes upon the lives of men, or they reflect their eyes upon their own
bo­ſomes, the hypocriſie will too palpably diſcover it ſelf: for ſurely, which
way ſo ever the faces look, the hands and feet of the moſt men move hell-ward:
If malice, fraud, cruelty, oppreſſion, injuſtice, exceſs, uncleanneſs, pride,
con­tention, covetouſneſs, lyes, hereſies, blaſphemies, diſobe­dience be the
way thither, wo is me, how many walk in that wide and open road to
de­ſtruction? but even there where the heart pretends to innocence, let a man
ſtrictly examine his own affections, [[Page
83]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=40) he ſhall finde
them ſo deeply earthed, that he ſhall be for­ced to confeſs his claim to
Heaven is but faſhionable: Ask thy ſelf but this one queſtion, O man,
whatſoever thou art, ask it ſeriouſly; Might I this very hour go to Heaven, am
I willing and de­ſirous to make a preſent change of this life for a bet­ter?
and tell me ſincerely, what anſwer thou receiveſt from thine own heart. Thy
judgment cannot but tell thee that the place is a thouſand times better; that
the condi­tion would be infinitely ad­vantageous, to exchange baſe­neſs for
glory, miſery for bleſſedneſs, time for eternity, a living death, for a life
im­mortal: If thou do now fum­ble, [[Page
84]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=41) and ſhuffle, and
demur upon the reſolution, be con­vinced of thine own world­lineſs, and
infidelity; and know, that if thy heart had as much of Heaven as thy tongue,
thou couldſt not but ſay with the choſen veſſel,Phil. 1. 23. I deſire to
depart hence, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.

### 1.26. XXVI.

There is no earthly pleaſure whereof we ſhall not ſoon grow weary; and be as
will­ing to intermit, as ever we were to entertain it; and if the uſe of it
continue, the very frequency makes it diſregard­ed; ſo as that which at firſt
we eſteemed rare and preci­ous, is now looked upon as common and deſpicable;
and [[Page 85]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=41) if it
be ſuch, as that our impetuous affection is too much tranſported with a
pre­ſent fruition, we are ſo much the more diſtempered in the loſs: on the
contrary, thoſe painful yokes, which at the firſt impoſing ſeemed
inſup­portable, grow tolerable by cuſtom and long acquaint­ance; ſo as I know
not how it comes to paſs, that time hath a contrary power, both to aggravate,
and lighten evils: thoſe pleaſures are onely worthy to carry our hearts, which
are meaſured by no leſs then eternity; and thoſe pains moſt juſtly for­midable
which know neither end, nor remiſſion.

[[Page 86]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=42)

### 1.27. XXVII.

The nearer our Saviour drew to his glory, the more humility he expreſſed: His
followers,Joh. 13. 16. were firſt his ſer­vants,Joh. 15. 8. and he their
Maſter;Joh. 15. 14. then his diſciples and he their Teacher; ſoon after they
were his friends, and he theirs; ſtraightways after his reſurrection, and
entrance into an immortal condition, they were his brethren;Joh. 20. 17. Go to
my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend to my Father, and your Father.
Laſtly, they are incorporated into him, and made partakers of his glory,Joh.
17. 21, 22, 23. That they alſo may be one with us, ſaith he, I in them, and
thou in me: that they may be made perfect in one; and the [[Page
87]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=42) glory which thou
gaveſt me, I have given them. O Saviour, was this done for the de­preſſing of
thy ſelf, or for the exaltation of us; or rather for both? how couldſt thou
more depreſs thy ſelf, then thus to match thy ſelf with us poor wretched
creatures? how couldſt thou more exalt us, then to raiſe us unto this
entireneſs with thee the All-glorious, and eternal Son of God? how ſhould we
learn of thee to improve our high­eſt advancement to our deep­eſt humility,
and ſo to regard each other, that when we are greateſt, we ſhould be leaſt?

### 1.28. XXVIII.

How apt we are to miſcon­ſtrue the Spirit of God, to [[Page
88]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=43) our own
diſadvantage? whiles the bleſſed Apoſtle bids us to work out our ſal­vation
with fear and trembling; he doth not bid us to work it out with doubt and
diſtruſt: It is the Pſalmiſts charge,Pſal. 2. that we ſhould ſerve the Lord
with fear, and rejoyce in him with trembling; ſo as there is a fear without
diffidence, and a trembling that may conſiſt with joy; trembling is an effect
of fear, but this fear which we muſt affect is re­verential, not ſlaviſh, not
diſtruſtful: Indeed, when we look upon our ſelves, and con­ſider our own
frailties and corruptions, and Gods in­finite juſtice, we have too juſt cauſe
of doubt and dejection, yea (were it not for better [[Page
89]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=43) helps) of utter
deſpair; but when we caſt up our eyes to the power of him that hath undertaken
for us, and the faithfulneſs of him that hath promiſed; and the ſure mer­cies
of him that hath begun his good work in us, we can fear with confidence, and
re­joyce in our trembling: For what are our ſins to his mer­cies, our
unworthineſs to his infinite merits, our weakneſſes to his omnipotence! I will
therefore ſo diſtruſt my ſelf, that I will be ſtedfaſtly con­fident in the God
of my ſal­vation; I will ſo tremble be­fore the glorious Majeſty of my God,
that I may not abate of the joy of his never-failing mercy.

[[Page 90]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=44)

### 1.29. XXIX.

What a large and open hand hath our God? how in­finitely doth his bounty
tran­ſcend not the practiſe onely, but the admiration of man? We think it well
if upon often asking we can receive ſmall favors: if after long delay, we can
be gratified with a condeſcent; and if we have received one curteſie, that is
a bar to a ſecond; whereas our munificent God gives us not onely what we ask,
but what we ask not; and there­fore before we ask: yea, it is he that gives us
to ask, neither could we ſo much as crave good things, if he did not put into
us thoſe holy deſires; yea, he not onely gives us [[Page
91]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=44) bleſſings,
before we ask; but he gives us the beſt things, a right to eternal glory,
before we are at all, yea, before the world was; and as he prevents us in
time, ſo he exceeds our thoughts in meaſure, giving us more then we ask:
Rachel would have a Son; God gives her two: Abraham ſues that Iſhmael may
live; God gives him to proſper and to be the father of many Princes: Yet more,
he gives us what we cannot ask. The dumb Demoniack could not ſue for himſelf;
his very ſilence was vocal, and receives what he would, and could not requeſt:
yea laſtly, which is the great improvement of his mercy, he gives us againſt
our asking; our ignorance ſues againſt our [[Page
92]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=45) ſelves,
requiring hurtful things, he will not ſuffer our hearts and tongues to wrong
us; but withholds what we unfitly crave, and gives us what we ſhould, and do
not crave; as the fond childe cryes to his father for a knife; he reaches him
a ſpoon that may feed, and not hurt him. O the Ocean of divine bounty,
boundleſs, bottom­leſs; O our wretched un­worthineſs, if we be either
niggardly to our ſelves in not asking bleſſings, or unthank­ful to our God in
not ac­knowledging them!

### 1.30. XXX.

Infidelity and faith look both through the ſame per­ſpective glaſs, but at
contrary [[Page 93]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=45)
ends: Infidelity looks through the wrong end of the glaſs, and therefore ſees
thoſe objects which are neer, a far off; and makes great things little;
diminiſhing the greateſt ſpiritual bleſſings; and re­moving far from us,
threat­ned evils: Faith looks at the right end, and brings the bleſſings that
are far off in time, cloſe to our eye; and multiplies Gods mercies which in a
diſtance loſt their greatneſs: Thus the Father of the faithful ſaw his ſeed
poſſeſſed of the promiſed land, when as yet he had no ſeed, nor was likely to
have any; when the ſeed which he ſhould have, ſhould not enjoy it till after
four hundred years; thus that good Patri­ark [[Page
94]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=46) ſaw Chriſts day,
and re­joyced: Thus our firſt parent comforted himſelf after his ejection out
of paradiſe, with the foreſight of that bleſſed ſeed of the woman, which
ſhould be exhibited almoſt four thouſand years after: ſtill, and ever faith is
like it ſelf; what uſe were there of that grace, if it did not fetch home to
my eye things fu­ture, and inviſible?

That this diſſolved body ſhall be raiſed out of the duſt, and enlived with
this very ſoul wherewith it is now animated; and both of them put into a
condition eternally glorious, is as clearly repre­ſented to my ſoul in this
glaſs, as if it were already done. Faithful is he that hath pro­miſed, [[Page
95]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=46) which will alſo
do it.

### 1.31. XXXI.

Who can think other then with ſcorn of that baſe and unworthy conceit which
hath been entertained by ſome, that our Saviour lived here on earth upon alms?
He that vouchſafed to take upon him the ſhape of a ſervant, would have hated
to take upon him the trade of a begger: Service is a lawful calling; beggery
not ſo: he that gave life to all creatures, could take a main­tenance from
them without asking: he that did command the fiſh to bring the tribute money
for himſelf and his diſciples, and could multiply a few loaves and fiſhes for
the [[Page 96]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=47)
relief of thouſands; could rather raiſe a ſuſtenance to himſelf, and his, then
beg it: But here was neither need, nor cauſe; even ordinary means failed not;
many wealthy followers, who had received cures and miracu­lous deliverances
(beſides heavenly doctrine) from him,Luk. 8. 2. miniſtred to him of their
ſub­ſtance: neither was this out of charity, but out of duty; in the charge
which he gave to his diſciples (when he ſent them by payrs to preach a­broad)
he tells them the labor­er is worthy of his wages; and can we think this rule
doth not much more hold concern­ing himſelf? had not him­ſelf and his family
been fur­niſhed with a meet ſtock [[Page
97]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=47) raiſed from
hence; what purſe was it which Judas bore? and how could he be a theif in his
office, if his bags were empty? He therefore that could ſay, It is a more
bleſſed thing to give, then to receive; certainly would not chooſe (when it
was in his power) rather to receive then give: The earth is the Lords, and the
fulneſs thereof; and he di­ſtributes it as he pleaſeth, amongſt the children
of men: For me, I hope I ſhall have the grace to be content with whatſoever
ſhare ſhall fall to my lot; but my prayer ſhall be that I may beg of none but
God.

### 1.32. XXXII.

What a madneſs it is in [[Page
98]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=48) us to preſume,
on our in­tereſt in Gods favor, for the ſecuring of our ſinful­neſs from
judgment? The Angels were deeper in it then we mortals can ever hope to be, in
theſe houſes of clay; yet long ſince are ugly Devils; and they which enjoyed
the liberty of the glorious Heavens, are now reſerved in everlaſting chains of
darkneſs; And if we look down upon earth, what darl­ing had God in the world
but Iſrael? This was his firſt born, his lot, his inhe­ritance; of whom he
ſaid, Here I have a delight to dwell. And now, where is it? O the woful
deſolations of that ſelect people! What is it to tell of the ſuffoſſion of
[[Page 99]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=48) her
vineyards?Pſa. 80. 13. vaſtation of her tents?Jer. 4. 20. the devouring of her
land?Eſa. 1. 7. demolition of walls?Pſa. 89. 40. breaking down Al­tars?Eſa.
27. 11. burning of Cities?Eſa. 13. 16. ſpoyling of houſes? daſhing in peices
their children, raviſhing their wives,Pſa. 78. 84. killing of their Prieſts,
eating of their own children of but a ſpan long,Lam. 2. 26. and a thouſand
ſuch woful ſymptomes of war: the Pſalmiſt hath ſaid a word for all (in a juſt,
but contrary ſenſe) Deſtructions are come to a perpetual end; what
deſtru­ction can be more, when there is no Iſrael? How is that wretched nation
vaniſh­ed no man knows whither! ſo as it was Jezebels curſe that nothing was
left, whereof it could be ſaid, this was [[Page
100]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=49) Jezebel, So
there is not one peece of a man left in all the world, of whom we can ſay;
This was of one of the tribes of Iſrael: as for thoſe famous Churches, which
were, (ſince that) honored with the preaching, and pens of the bleſſed
Apoſtles, where are they now to be lookt for, but amongſt the rubbiſh of
cur­ſed Mahumetiſm? O that we could not be high-minded, but fear.

### 1.33. XXXIII.

What a woful converſion is here? The ſting of death is ſin; and the ſting of
ſin is death; both meet in man, to make him perfectly miſera­ble; Death could
not have ſtung us; no, could not have [[Page
101]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=49) been at all, if
it had not been for ſin: And ſin, though in it ſelf extreamly heinous yet were
not ſo dreadful, and horrible, if it were not attend­ed with death: How do we
owe our ſelves to the mercy of a Saviour, that hath freed us from the evil of
both; ha­ving pulled out the ſting of death which is ſin, that it cannot hurt
us; and having taken ſuch order with the ſting of ſin, which is death, that in
ſtead of hurting, it ſhall turn beneficial to us: Lord, into what a ſafe
con­dition haſt thou put us? If neither ſin, nor death can hurt us, what
ſhould we fear?

[[Page 102]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=50)

### 1.34. XXXIV.

How unjuſtly hath the preſumption of blaſphemous cavillers been wont to caſt
the envy of their condemna­tion meerly upon the abſolute will of an
unreſpective power, as if the damnation of the creature were onely of a
ſupreame will, not of a juſt merit; the very name of Ju­ſtice convinces them;
a puni­tive Juſtice cannot but ſup­poſe an offence: It is not for us to rack
the brains, and ſtrain the heart-ſtrings of plain honeſt Chriſtians with the
ſubtilties of diſtinctions, of a negative, and poſitive reprobation, of cauſes
and conſequences; truths meet for the Schools: It is enough that all Chriſtian
Divines; the [[Page
103]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=50) Synods both of
Dort and Trent agree in this truth; that never man is, was, can be miſerable
but for ſin, yea, for his own ſin; The Prophet tells us ſo in terms,Lam. 3.
39. Why is the living man ſorrowful, man ſuffereth for his ſin: Nothing can be
more true then that of Bildad the Shuhite,Job. 8. 20. Behold, God will not
caſt away a perfect man: thy perdition is of thy ſelf, O Iſrael. It is no leſs
then rank blaſphemy to make God the author of ſin:Pſa. 5. 4. Thou art the God
that haſt no pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall any evil dwel with thee,
ſaith the Pſalmiſt; our ſin is our own, and the wages of ſin is death; he that
doth the work earns the wages; ſo then the righteous God is cleared [[Page
104]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=51) both of our
ſin, and our death; onely his juſtice pays us what we will needs
de­ſerve;Ezek. 18. 23. Have I any pleaſure at all (ſaith he) that the wicked
ſhould die, and not that he ſhould return from his ways and live? wherefore
return yea and live. What a wretched thing is a willful ſinner that will needs
be guilty of his own death? Nothing is more odious a­mongſt men, then for a
man to be a felon of himſelf; beſides the forfeiture of his eſtate, Chriſtian
burial is denied him, and he is caſt forth into the highway, with a ſtake
pitcht through his body, ſo as every paſſenger that ſees that woful monument
is rea­dy to ſay: There lyes the car­caſs, but where is the ſoul?

[[Page 105]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=51) But ſo
much more hein­ous is the ſelf-felony of a wilful ſinner, becauſe it is
immediatly acted upon the ſoul; and carries him with pleaſure in the ways of
an eternal death.Pſal. 19. 12, 13. O Lord, cleanſe thou me from my ſecret
faults; keep thy ſervant alſo from pre­ſumptuous ſins, leſt they get the
dominion over me.

### 1.35. XXXV.

We are wont to ſay, That we ought to give even the Devil his due; and ſurely,
it is poſſible for us to wrong that malignant ſpirit, in caſt­ing upon him
thoſe evils which are not properly his: It is true, that he is the tempter;
and both injects [[Page
106]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=52) evil motions,
and draws them forth into act: but yet, all ill is not immediatly his; we have
enough beſides, of our own:Jam. 1. 14, 15. Every man, ſaith St. James, is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed; then when luſt
hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin; and ſin when it is fi­niſhed bringeth
forth death; Lo, both the luſt, and the ſeducement are our own; the ſin is
ours, the death ours: There are indeed dia­bolical ſuggeſtions which are
immediatly caſt into us by that wicked one; but there are carnal tentations
that are raiſed out of our own corrupt nature; theſe need not his immediate
hand; he was the maine agent in our de­pravation; [[Page
107]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=52) but being once
depraved we can act evil of our ſelves: And if Satan be the father of ſin, our
will is the mother; and ſin is the curſed iſſue of both: He could not make our
ſin with­out our ſelves; we concur to our own undoing: It was the charge of
the Apoſtle, That we ſhould not give place to the Devil; Lo, he could not take
it, unleſs we gave it; our will betrays us to his tyranny; in vain ſhall we
cry out of the malice and fraud of wicked ſpirits, whiles we nouriſh their
complices in our boſomes.

### 1.36. XXXVI.

I cannot but think with what unſpeakable joy old [[Page
108]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=53) Simeon dyed,
when, after long waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael, he had now ſeen, the
Lords Chriſt; when I hear him ſay, Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart
in peace, ac­cording to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation;
Methinks I ſhould ſee his ſoul ready to flie out of his mouth in an heavenly
raviſhment; and even then upon its wing towards its glory; for now his eyes
ſaw, and his arms embraced, in Gods ſalvati­on, his own; in Iſraels glory, his
own: How gladly doth he now ſee death, when he hath the Lord of life in his
boſome? or how can he wiſh to cloſe up his eyes with any other object? yet
when I have ſeriouſly con­ſidered [[Page
109]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=53) it, I cannot
ſee wherein our condition comes ſhort of his: He ſaw the childe Jeſus but in
his ſwathing-bands, when he was but now en­tering upon the great work of our
redemption; we ſee him, after the full accom­pliſhment of it, gloriouſly
triumphing in Heaven: He ſaw him but buckling on his armor, and entring into
the liſts; we ſee him victorious. Who is this that cometh from Edom with dyed
garments from Bozra; Eſa. 63. 1. this that is glorious in his apparel,
traveling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength, migh­ty to ſave? He could onely
ſay:Eſa. 9. 6. To us a childe is born, to us a ſon is given: We can ſay, Thou
haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led captivity [[Page
110]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=54) captive, Pſa.
68. 18. thou haſt received gifts for men: It is true, the difference is, he
ſaw his Savi­our with bodily eyes, we with mental; but the eyes of our Faith
are no leſs ſure and unfailing, then thoſe of Senſe: Lord, why ſhould not I,
whoſe eyes have no leſs ſeen thy ſalvation, ſay, Now let thy ſervant depart,
not in peace onely, but in a joyful ſence of my inſtant glory.

### 1.37. XXXVII.

When I think on my Sa­viour in his agony, and on his croſs, my ſoul is ſo
cloud­ed with ſorrow, as if it would never be clear again: thoſe bloody drops,
and thoſe dreadful ejulations (methinks) ſhould be paſt all [[Page
111]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=54) reach of
comfort: but when I ſee his happy eluctation out of theſe pangs, and hear him
cheerfully rendring his ſpirit into the hands of his Father; when I finde him
trampling upon his grave, at­tended with glorious Angels, and aſcending in the
chariot of a cloud to his Heaven; I am ſo elevated with joy, as that I ſeem to
have forgotten there was ever any cauſe of greif in thoſe ſufferings. I could
be paſſionate to think, O Saviour, of thy bitter and and ignominious death,
and moſt of all, of thy vehement ſtruglings with thy fathers wrath for my
ſake, but thy conqueſt and glory takes me off, and calls me to Hallelu­jahs of
joy and triumph; [[Page
112]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=55) Bleſsing,
Revel. 5. 13. honor, glory, and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the
Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.

### 1.38. XXXVIII.

It is not hard to obſerve that the more holy any per­ſon is, the more he is
afflicted with others ſin: Lot vexed his righteous ſoul with the un­clean
converſation of the So­domites; Davids eyes guſh't out rivers of water becauſe
men kept not the Law; Thoſe that can look with dry and undiſpleaſed eyes upon
ano­thers ſin, never truly mourn­ed for their own: Had they abhorred ſin, as
ſin, the offence of a God would have been grievous to them in whomſoever: It
is a godleſs [[Page
113]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=55) heart that doth
not finde it ſelf concerned in Gods quarrel; and that can laugh at that, which
the God of Heaven frowns at; my ſoul is neareſt to me, my ſorrow therefore for
my ſin muſt begin at home, but it may not reſt there; from thence it ſhall
diffuſe it ſelf all the world over:2 Cor. 11. 19. Who is offended, and I burn
not? who offendeth, and I weep not?

### 1.39. XXXIX.

The world little conſiders the good advantage that is made of ſins: ſurely the
whole Church of God hath reaſon to bleſs God for Thomas his unbelief, not in
the act, which was odious (after ſo good aſſurances) but in the [[Page
114]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=56) iſſue his doubt
proves our evi­dence; and his confeſſion (after his touch had convin­ced him)
was more noble, then his incredulity was ſhameful. All his attendance upon
Chriſt had not taught him ſo much divinity, as this one touch: Often had he
ſaid, my Lord, but never my God, till now: Even Peters con­feſſion (though
rewarded with the change of his name) came ſhort of this: The flame that is
beaten down by the blaſt of the bellowes, riſes higher then otherwiſe it
would; and the ſpring water that runs level in the Plain, yet if it fall low,
it will there­fore riſe, high; the ſhaken tree roots the deeper: Not that we
ſhould ſin that grace may abound, [[Page
115]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=56) God forbid; he
can never hope to be good that will be there­fore ill, that he may be the
better: but that our holy zeal ſhould labor to improve our miſcarriages to our
ſpiri­tual gain, and the greater glo­ry of that Majeſty whom we have offended:
To be better­ed by grace it is no maſtery; but to raiſe more holineſs out of
ſin, is a noble imita­tion of that holy God, who brings light out of darkneſs,
life out of death.

### 1.40. XL.

Every man beſt knows his own complaints, we look up­on the outſides of many,
whom we think happy; who in the meane time are ſecretly wrung with the inward
ſenſe [[Page 116]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=57) of
their own concealed ſor­rows, and under a ſmooth and calm countenance ſmo­ther
many a tempeſt in their boſome. There are thoſe, whoſe faces ſmile, whiles
their conſcience gripes them cloſely within; There are thoſe that can
diſſemble their poverty, and domeſtick vexa­tions, reſerving their ſighs till
their back be turned; that can pick their teeth abroad, when they are faſting,
and hungry at home: and many a one forces a ſong when his heart is heavy: No
doubt Naomi made many a ſhort meal after her return to Bethlehem, yet did not
whine to her great kinred in a bemoaning of her want: And good Hannah bit in
many a grief, which her [[Page
117]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=57) inſulting rival
might not ſee: On the contrary, there are many whom we pity as mi­ſerable,
that laugh in their ſleeve, and applaud them­ſelves in their ſecret felicity;
and would be very loath to exchange conditions with thoſe that commiſerate
them. A ragged Cynick likes him­ſelf at leaſt as well as a great Alexander:
The mortifyed Chriſtian that knows both worlds, looks with a kinde of
contented ſcorn upon the proud gallant, that con­temns him; as feeling that
heaven within him, which the other is not capable to believe.

It is no judging of mens real eſtate by their ſem­blance; nor valuing others
[[Page 118]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=58) worth by
our own rate: And for our ſelves, if we have once laid ſure grounds of our own
inward contentment and hap­pineſs, it matters not greatly if we be miſ-known
of the world.

### 1.41. XLI.

For one man to give titles to another is ordinary; but for the great God to
give titles to a poor wretched man is no leſs then wonder­ful: Thus doth the
Lord to Job; There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man: O
what muſt he needs be, in whom his maker glories! Lo; who would have looked
for a Saint in ſo obſcure a corner of the eaſt, and in ſo dark a time, [[Page
119]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=58) before ever the
Law gave light to the world? yet even then the land of UZ yields a Job; no
time, no place can be any bar to an infinite mer­cy: Even this while, for
ought I ſee, the Sun ſhined more bright in Midian then in Goſhen: Gods
election will be ſure to finde out his own any where out of hell; and if they
could be there, even there al­ſo: Amongſt all thoſe ido­latrous heathen, Job
is perfect and upright; his religion and integrity is ſo much the more
glorious, becauſe it is ſo ill neighbored; as ſome rich Diamond is ſet off by
a dark foyl. O the infinite goodneſs of the Almighty that picks out ſome few
grains out of the large chaff-heap of the [[Page
120]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=59) world, which he
reſerves for the granary of a bleſſed im­mortality: It is not of him that
willeth, nor in him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy.

We might well imagine that ſuch a ſprig muſt ſprout out of the ſtock of
faithful Abraham; what other loyns were likely to yield ſo holy an iſſue? And
if his Sarah muſt be the mother of the promiſed ſeed, yet why might he not
alſo raiſe a bleſ­ſed ſeed from Keturah? The birth doth not always follow the
belly: even this ſecond brood yields an heir of his fathers faith;Gen. 25. 6.
it is ſaid, That to the ſons of the Concubines Abraham gave gifts, and ſent
them away to the Eaſt: [[Page
121]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=59) Surely this ſon
of the Con­cubine carries away as rich a legacy of his fathers grace as ever
was enjoyed by the Son of the promiſe at home.

The gifts that Abraham gave to Midian were no­thing to thoſe gifts which the
God of Abraham gives to this ſon of Midian; who was perfect and upright, one
that feared God and eſchued evil. I perceive the holy and wiſe God meant to
make this man a patern as of pati­ence, ſo of all heavenly ver­tues; he could
not be fit for that uſe if he were not exqui­ſite; and what can be want­ing to
that man, of whom God holily boaſts that he is Perfect?

And now what mettal is ſo [[Page
221]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=60) fit to
challenge the fire of affliction as this pure gold? and who is ſo fit a match
for the great Adverſary as this Champion of God? Never had he been put upon ſo
hard a combat, if God had not well known both the ſtrength that he had given
him, and the happy ſucceſs of his con­flict: little doth that good man know
what wager is laid on his head, but ſtrongly in­counters all his tryals: The
Sabeans have bereft him of his Oxen; the Chaldees of his Camels; the fire from
Hea­ven of his ſheep; the tempeſt of his children; Satan of his health; and
had not his wife been left to him for his great­eſt croſs, and his friends for
his further tormentors, I [[Page
123]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=60) doubt whether
they had eſcaped.

Lo there ſits the great Po­tentate of the Eaſt, naked and forlorn in the
aſhes; as deſtitute of all comforts, as full of painful boyls and botches;
ſcraping his loath­ſome hide with a potſheard; yet even in that woful poſture
poſſeſſing his ſoul in patience, maintaining his innocence, juſtifying his
Maker, cheering himſelf in his Redeemer, and happily triumphing over all his
miſeries, and at laſt made the great miroir of divine bounty to all
generations: Now muſt Job pray for his freindly perſecutors, and is ſo high in
favor with God, that it is made an argument of extream wrath againſt Iſrael;
[[Page 124]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=61) that
though Noah, Ezek 14. 14, 20. Daniel, and Job were in the land they ſhould
deliver none but their own ſouls: O God, this Saint could not have had this
ſtrength of invincible pati­ence without thee: thou that rewardeſt it in him,
didſt be­ſtow it upon him: it is thy great mercy to crown thine owne works in
us: thy gifts are free, thou canſt fortifie even my weak ſoul with the ſame
powers, ſtrengthen me with the ſame grace, and im­poſe what thou wilt.

### 1.42. XLII.

As it ſhall be once in glory, ſo it is in grace, there are de­grees of it: The
Apoſtle that ſaid of his auditors, they have received the holy Ghoſt as [[Page
125]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=61) well as we, did
not ſay; they have received the holy Ghoſt as much as we: We know the Apoſtles
had ſo much as to give it to others; none beſides them could do ſo: It is an
happy thing to have any quantity of true ſanctifiying grace at all; every drop
of water is water, and every grain of gold is gold, every meaſure of grace is
precious: But who is there that when he is dry would take up with one drop of
liquor when he might have more? or if co­vetouſly minded, would ſit down
content with one dram of gold? in ſuch caſes a little doth but draw on a
deſire of more: it is ſtrange to ſee that in all other commodities we deſire a
fulneſs: If God give [[Page
126]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=62) us fruit of our
bodies, it con­tents us not to have an imper­fect childe, but we wiſh it may
have the full ſhape and proportion: and, when God hath anſwered us in that, we
do not reſt in the integrity of parts, but deſire that it may attain to a
fulneſs of under­ſtanding, and of ſtature; and then laſtly to a fulneſs of
age: We would have full diſhes, full cups, full cofers, full barns; a fulneſs
of all things, ſave the beſt of all, which is, the holy Ghoſt. Any mea­ſure of
ſpiritual grace con­tents us; ſo as we are ready to ſay with Eſau: I have
enough my brother. There is a ſinful kinde of contentation, where­with many
faſhionable Chriſtians ſuffer themſelves [[Page
127]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=62) to be beguiled,
to the utter undoing of their ſouls: for hereupon they grow utterly careleſs
to get, what they think they have already: who cares to eat that is full
cram­ed? and by this means they live and die graceleſs: for had they ever
taſted how ſweet the Lord is in the Graces of his holy Spirit, they could
never think they had enough; and whiles they do think ſo, they are utterly
uncapable of either having, or deſiring more: As there is a ſinful; ſo there
is an holy covetouſneſs, which the more it hath, the more it affects: Lord
make me thus cove­tous, and I cannot chuſe but be rich▪

### 1.43. XLIII.

What a marvelous famili­arity was this which Moſes had with God:Exod. 33. 11.
That the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, face to face, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend!
and yet more, that Moſes ſo ſpake to God! what a bold and high requeſt was
that which Moſes made to God: I be­ſeech thee ſhew me thy glory, that is (as
it is there interpreted) thy face! that face which no man might ſee and live:
Lo; God had immediately be­fore ſpoken to Moſes even to his face, out of the
cloudy pillar: that doth not ſatisfie his holily-ambitious ſoul: but, as he
heard the voyce, ſo he muſt ſee the face of the Almighty: That cloudy [[Page
129]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=63) pillar did
ſufficiently repreſent unto him the preſence of the great God of Iſrael; yet
ſtill he ſues for a ſight of his glory: This is no patern for fleſh and blood;
far be it from our thoughts to aſpire ſo high: Thy face, O God, will we ſeek:
but in thy bleſſed ordinances, not in thy glorious and in­comprehenſible
eſſence: It is not for me as yet to preſume ſo far as to deſire to ſee that
infinite light which thou art, or that light wherewith thou art cloathed, or
that light in­acceſſible wherein thou dwel­eſt: Onely, now ſhew me the light
of thy countenance in grace, and prepare my ſoul for that light of glory; when
I ſhall ſee as I am ſeen.

### 1.44. XLIV.

In the waters of life, the divine Scriptures, there are ſhallows, and there
are deeps; ſhallows where the lamb may wade, and deeps where the Elephant may
ſwim: If we be not wiſe to diſtinguiſh, we may eaſily miſ-carry: he that can
wade over the foord, cannot ſwim through the deep; and if he miſtake the
paſſage he drowns: What in­finite miſcheif hath ariſen to the Church of God
from the preſumption of ignorant and unlettered men, that have taken upon them
to interpret the moſt obſcure Scriptures, and pertinaciouſly defended their
own ſenſe? How con­trary is this to all practiſe in [[Page
131]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=64) whatſoever
vocation? In the Taylors trade, every man can ſtitch a ſeam, but every man
cannot cut out a gar­ment: In the Saylers art, eve­ry one may be able to pull
at a cable, but every one can­not guide the helm: In the Phyſitians
profeſſion, every goſſip can give ſome ordina­ry receits upon common
ex­perience; but to finde the na­ture of the diſeaſe, and to pre­ſcribe proper
remedies from the juſt grounds of art, is pro­per to the profeſſors of that
ſcience; and we think it ab­ſurd and dangerous to allow every ignorant
Mountebank to practiſe: In matter of law, every plain country-man knows what
belongs to diſtraining, impounding, re­plevying: [[Page
132]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=65) but to give
ſound counſel to a clyent in a point of difficulty, to draw firm conveyances;
to plead effectu­ally, and to give ſound judgment in the hardeſt caſes, is for
none but Barriſters, and Benchers: And ſhall we think it ſafe that in
Divinity, which is the miſtreſs of all Sciences, and in matters which may
concern the eternal ſafety of the ſoul, every man ſhould take upon him to
ſhape his own coat, to ſteer his own way, to give his own doſe, to put and
adjudg his own caſe? The old word was, that Ar­tiſts are worthy to be truſted
in their own trade: Wherefore hath God given to men skill in arts and tongues?
Where­fore do the apteſt wits ſpend [[Page
133]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=65) their times and
ſtudies from their infancy upon theſe ſa­cred imployments, if men al­together
inexpert in all the grounds, both of art and lan­guage, can be able to paſs as
ſound a judgment in the depths of Theological truths, as they? How happy were
it if we could all learn (accor­ding to that word of the A­poſtle) to keep our
ſelves within our own line: As Chriſtians, the Scriptures are ours; but to
uſe, to enjoy; to read, to hear, to learn, to meditate, to practiſe; not to
in­terpret according to our pri­vate conceit; for this faculty we muſt look
higher:Mal. 2. 7. The Prieſts lips are to preſerve know­ledg: and they ſhall
ſeek the Law at his mouth: for he is the [[Page

the Lord of hoſts.

### 1.45. XLV.

When we ſee the year in his prime and pride, decked with beautiful bloſſoms,
and all goodly varieties of flowers, cheered with the Muſick of birds, and
ſtated in a ſweet and moderate temper of heat and cold; how glad we are that
we have made ſo good an exchange for an hard and chilling winter; and how
rea­dy we could be to wiſh that this pleaſant and happy ſeaſon might laſt all
the year long: But herein (were our deſires ſatisfied) we ſhould wiſh to our
own great diſadvantage: for if the ſpring were not fol­lowed with an intenſion
of Summers heat, thoſe fruits [[Page
135]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=66) whoſe hopes we
ſee in the bud and flower, could never come to any perfection: and even that
ſucceeding fervor, if it ſhould continue long, would be no leſs prejudicial to
the health and life of all creatures; and if there were not a relaxation of
that vigo­rous heat in Autumn, ſo as the ſap returns back into the root, we
could never look to ſee but one years fruit. And thus alſo it is ſpiritually:
if our proſperity were not inter­mixed with viciſſitudes of croſſes; and if
the lively beams of grace were not ſometimes interchanged with cold
deſer­tions, we ſhould never know what belongs to ſpiritual life: What ſhould
we do then, but be both patient of, and [[Page
136]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=67) thankful for
our changes; and make no account of any con­ſtancy, till we attain to the
Region of reſt and bleſſed­neſs?

### 1.46. XLVI.

What fools doth the devil make of thoſe men which would fain otherwiſe be
accounted wiſe? who would think that men could be ſo far forſaken of their
reaſon, as to fall down before thoſe ſtocks and ſtones which their own hands
had carved; to guide their enterpriſes by the fond auguries of the flying, or
poſture, or noyſe of fowls; or the inſpection of the en­trails of beaſts; to
tye the confidence of their ſucceſs to certain ſcrawls, and [[Page
137]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=67) characters,
which themſelves have deviſed: to read their own or others fortunes in their
hands or ſtars: to ſuffer themſelves mocked with de­ceitful viſions? neither
are his ſpiritual deluſions leſs groſs and palpable; wiſe Solomon ſpeaks of
the wickedneſs of folly;Eccleſ. 7. 25. and we may no leſs truly invert it; the
folly of wickedneſs,Matth. 7. 26. the fool, ſaith our Saviour, builds his
houſe upon the ſand, 1 Tim 6. 17. ſo as it may be waſht away with the next
waves; what other doth the fooliſh worldling, that builds all his hopes upon
uncertain riches,Heb 11. 25. momen­tany pleaſures,Prov. 31. 30. deceitful
favors?Eccleſ. 2. 14. The fool (ſaith So­lomon) walketh in darkneſs; Eccleſ.
10. 15. the ſinner walks in the darkneſs [[Page
138]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=68) of ignorance,
through the works of darkneſs, to the pit of darkneſs: The fool, ſaith the
Preacher, knows not the way into the city: The world­ling may perhaps hit the
way through the golden gates of honor; or down to the mines of wealth; or to
the flowry garden of pleaſure; but the way of true peace he knows not: he no
more knows the way to Heaven, then if there were none: The fool (ſaith the
Pſalmiſt) hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God; Did not the wicked man ſay
ſo, he durſt not wilfully ſin in the face of ſo mighty and dreadful an
a­venger. Laſtly, the fool is apt to part with his patrimony for ſome gay
toys: and how ready is the carnal heart to [[Page
139]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=68) caſt away the
Favor of God, the inheritance of Heaven, the ſalvation of his ſoul, for theſe
vain earthly trifles? Holy men are wont to paſs with the world for Gods fools;
(alas! how little do theſe cenſurers know to paſs a true judgment of wiſdom
and folly? he that was rapt into the third Heaven, tells us, That the
fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, 1 Cor. 1. 25. and the weak­neſs of God
ſtronger then men; but this we are ſure of, that wicked men are the devils
fools;Pro. 19. 29: and that judgments are prepared for ſcorners, and ſtripes
for the back of fools.

### 1.47. XLVII.

There are ſome things which are laudable in man, [[Page
140]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=69) but cannot be
incident into God; as a baſhful ſhamefaſt­neſs, and holy fear: And there are
ſome diſpoſitions blame-worthy in men, which are yet, in a right ſence, holily
aſcribed unto God, as unchangeableneſs, and irrepentance: Attributes and
qualities receive their limitations according to the meet ſubjects to which
they belong; with this ſure rule, That whatſoever may import an infinite
purity and perfecti­on, we have reaſon to aſcribe to our Maker; whatever may
argue infirmitie, miſery, cor­ruption, we have reaſon to take to our ſelves:
Neither is it otherwiſe in the condition of men: One mans vertue is anothers
vice; ſo boldneſs in a [[Page
141]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=69) woman,
baſhfulneſs in an old man, bounty in a poor man, parſimony in the great, are
as foully unbeſeeming, as bold­neſs in a Soldier, baſhfulneſs in a childe,
bounty in the rich, parſimony in the poor, are juſtly commendable. It is not
enough for us to know what is good in it ſelf, but what is proper for us:
elſe, we may be blemiſhed with that which is anothers honor.

### 1.48. XLVIII.

It is eaſie to obſerve that there are five degrees of the digeſtion of our
ſpiritual food: Firſt it is received into the cell of the ear, and there
digeſted by a careful attenti­on; then it is conveyed into the brain, and
there concoct­ed [[Page
142]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=70) by due
meditation, from thence it is ſent down into the heart, and there digeſted by
the affections; and from thence it is conveyed to the tongue, in conference,
and holy confeſſion; and laſtly, it is thence tranſmitted to the hand, and
there receives per­fect digeſtion, in our action and performance: And as the
life and health of the body cannot be maintained, except the material food
paſs through all the degrees of bodily concoction, no more can the ſoul live
and proſper in the want of any of theſe ſpiritual degrees of digeſtion; And as
where the food is per­fectly concocted, the body grows fat and vigorous; ſo is
it with the ſoul, where the [[Page
143]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=70) ſpiritual
repaſt is thus kind­ly digeſted: Were there not failings in all theſe degrees,
the ſouls of men would not be ſo meager and unthriving as they are. Some there
are that will not give ſo much as ear-room to the word of truth; ſuch are
willing recu­ſants: others will admit it per­haps, ſo far, but there let it
reſt; theſe are faſhionable au­ditors: ſome others can be content to let it
enter into the brain, and take up ſome place in their thoughts and memo­ries;
theſe are ſpeculative pro­feſſors; ſome (but fewer) others let it down into
their hearts, and there entertain it with ſecret liking, but hide it in their
boſomes, not daring to make profeſſion of it to the [[Page
144]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=71) world; theſe
are cloſe Nico­demians: Others take it into their mouthes, and buſie their
tongues in holy chat, yet do nothing; theſe are formal diſ­courſers: But alas,
how few are there whoſe hands ſpeak louder then their tongues; that
conſcionably hear, me­ditate, affect, ſpeak, do the word of their Maker, and
Redeemer?

### 1.49. XLIX.

Men that are in the ſame condition ſpeed not always alike: Barabbas was a
theif, murderer, ſeditionary, and deſerved hanging no leſs then the two
theeves that were crucified with our Saviour, yet he is diſmiſſed, and they
executed; And even of theſe [[Page
145]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=71) two (as our
Saviour ſaid of the two women grinding at the mill) one was taken, the other
refuſed; one went be­fore Peter to paradiſe, the other went before Judas into
hell: The providence and e­lection of a God may make a difference; we have no
reaſon in the ſame crime, to preſume upon a contrary iſſue: If that gracious
hand ſhall exempt us from the common judgment of our conſorts in evil, we have
cauſe  [...] leſs his mercy; but if his juſt hand ſhall ſweep us away in the
company of our wicked conſociates, we have reaſon to thank none but our ſelves
for our ſufferings.

### 1.50. L.

How ſweet a thing is re­venge [[Page
146]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=72) to us
naturally? even the very infant rejoyces to ſee him beaten that hath angerd
him; and is ready with his little hand to give that ſroke to the by-ſtander,
which he would have with more force returned to the offender; and how many
have we known in mortal quarrels cheerfully bleeding out their laſt drop, when
they have ſeen their enemy gaſping, and dying before them: This alone ſhews
how much there is re­maining in our boſome of the ſting of that old Serpent,
who was a murderer from the beginning, delighting in death, and enjoying our
torment; whereas, on the contrary, true grace is merciful, ready to forgive,
apt to return good [[Page
147]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=72) for evil,Col.
3. 13. to pray for our per­ſecutors; Nothing doth more clearly evince what
ſpirit we are of, then our diſpoſition in wrongs received: The car­nal heart
breathes nothing but revenge, and is ſtraight wringing the ſword out of the
hands of him that hath ſaid,Rom. 12. 19. Vengeance is mine: The regenerate
ſoul,Deut. 32. 35. contrarily, gives place to wrath, and puts on the bowels of
mercies, Col. 3. 12. 13. kind­neſs, humbleneſs of minde, meek­neſs, long
ſuffering, forbearing, forgiving: Rom. 12. 21. and will not be overcome with
evil, but over­comes evil with good. We have ſo much of God, as we can remit
injuries; ſo much of Satan, as we would revenge them.

It is worth obſerving how nature hath taught all living creatures to be their
own phyſitians; The ſame power that gave them a being hath led them to the
means of their own preſervation: No Indian is ſo ſavage, but that he knows the
uſe of his Tobac­co and Contra-yerva; yea even the brute creatures are bred
with this skill: The Dog when he is ſtomack-ſick can go right to his proper
Graſs; the Cat to her Nep; the Goat to his Hemlock; the Weaſel to Rue; the
Hart to Dittany; the ſick Lyon can cure himſelf with an Ape; the Monkey with a
Spider; the Bear with an Ant-heap; the [[Page
149]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=73) Panther with
mans dung; and the Stork is ſaid to have taught man the uſe of the glyſter; to
what purpoſe ſhould we inſtance when the caſe is univerſal? The Toad hath
recourſe to his Plantain­leaf; the Tortois to his Peni­royal; & in ſhort,
there is none but knows his own medicine: As for the reaſonable crea­ture, in
all the civilized re­gions of the world, we may well ſay now of every nation
as it was of old ſaid of Egypt, That it is a countrey of Phy­ſitions: There is
not an huſ­wife, but hath an Apothe­caries ſhop in her Garden; which affords
her thoſe re­ceipts, whereby ſhe heals the ayls of her complaining family.
Onely mankinde is [[Page
150]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=74) mortally ſoul-
ſick, and na­turally neither knows, nor ſeeks, nor cares for remedy. O thou
that art the great Phy­ſitian in Heaven, firſt cure our inſenſibleneſs; make
thou us as ſick of our ſins, as we have made our ſelves ſick by ſin, and then
ſpeak the word, and we ſhall be whole.

### 1.52. LII.

When I conſider the preci­ous ornaments of the high Prieſt, the rich Fabrick
and furniture of the Tabernacle, the bountiful gifts which the Princes of the
Tribes offered at the dedication of the Altar;Num. 8. I cannot but think what
a maſs of wealth Iſrael brought with them out of Egypt; theſe treaſures grew
not in the [[Page
151]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=74) wilderneſs;
neither did Jacob and his ſons bring them out of Canaan; they were ga­thered
in their Goſhen: It was an hard bondage under which Iſrael was held by the
latter Pharaohs; yet, as if then, in ſtead of the furnaces of bricks, they had
been labor­ing in the Silver mines, to their own advantage, they come out
laden with precious mettals: What ſhould I ſay to this? God ſaid, Iſrael is my
firſt born, and the firſt born was to have a double portion: What was Iſrael
but a type of Gods Church? now the Church of God may be held down with cruel
tyranny; but in ſpight of all oppoſition it will thrive;Pſal. 68. 13. And
though they have lyen among the pots, yet ſhall [[Page
152]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=75) they be as the
wings of a Dove covered with ſilver, and her feathers with yellow gold; And if
the Spouſe of Chriſt ſhall be ſtripped of her outward or­naments; yet the
kings daughter is allglorious within; rich in thoſe heavenly endowments of
Grace and holineſs, which ſhall make her dear and lovely in the eyes of her
ce­leſtial Bride-groom; ſhortly, the Church may be impair­ed in her external
eſtate; but if, the while, ſhe gathers ſo much the more of thoſe bet­ter
treaſures▪ what hath ſhe loſt? Godlineſs is great gain with contentment; If
ſhe have leſs of the world and more of God, what cauſe can ſhe have of
complaint, or her enemies of inſultation?

He that is a God of Order loves both to ſet, and keep it; For the ſervice of
his Sanctu­ary he appointed ſeveral offi­ces, and in thoſe offices ſe­veral
degrees; none of thoſe might enterfer with others: The Levites might not medle
with the Preiſts charge; nor one degree of Levites with another: The Porters
might not thruſt in amongſt the Singers, though perhaps ſome of their voyces
might be more tuneable; neither might the Singers change pla­ces with the
Porters: The ſons of Merari, that were to carry the boards,Num. 4. 29. 23.
bars, and pillars of the Tabernacle, and the Court, might not change [[Page
154]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=76) with the ſons
of Gerſhon for the lighter burthen of the curtains, and hangings; nor thoſe of
Gerſhon, Num. 4. 15. for the more holy load of the veſſels of the Sanctuary,
committed to the ſons of Kohath: Neither might the ſons of Kohath ſo much as
go in to ſee the co­vering of thoſe ſacred uten­ſils by Aaron, Num. 4. 20. and
his ſons; upon no leſs pain then death: So punctual was God in ſet­ing every
man his proper ſtation; and holding him to it, without either neglect, or
change: And why ſhould we think God leſs curious in his Evangelical Church? It
was the charge of him, who next under the Almighty, had the marſhalling of the
Church of the Gentiles; Let every man [[Page
155]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=76) abide in the
ſame calling, 1 Cor. 7. 20. where­in he was called: perhaps there may be a
better head for po­licy upon Plebeian ſhoulders then the Governors: ſhall that
man leave his rank, and thruſt into the chair of government? Neither is it
other in ſpiritual offices; It is no thinking that the wiſe and holy God will
be pleaſed with a wel-meant confuſion: For all our im­ployments in the ſervice
of the Almighty, we muſt con­ſult, not with our abilities, but with our
vocation.

### 1.54. LIIII.

I ſee too many men willing to live to no purpoſe; caring only to be rid of
time on what terms ſoever, making it the onely ſcope of their life to [[Page
156]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=77) live; A
diſpoſition that may well befit brute creatures, which are not capable of any
other aym ſave meerly their own preſervation: but for men that enjoy the
priviledg of reaſon, for Chriſtians that pretend a title to Religion, too baſe
and unworthy; where God hath beſtowed theſe higher faculties, he looks for
other improvements; For what a poor thing is it onely to live? a thing com­mon
to us, with the moſt de­ſpiſed vermin, that breeds on our own corruption: but
to live for ſome more excellent ends, is that which Reaſon ſuggeſts, and
Religion per­fits: Here then are divers ſubordinations of ends, whereof one
makes way for [[Page
157]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=77) another, and
all for the ſu­pream. We labor and exer­ciſe that we may eat, we eat that we
may live, and main­tain health and ſtrength; we deſire health and ſtrength
that we may do good to our ſelves and many; that we may be able to do ſervice
to God, King, and Country; and therein, we drive at the teſti­mony of a good
conſcience, approving to God our holy deſires, and endeavors; and in all
theſe, at the glory and ſalvation of our ſouls; and laſtly, in that, as the
higheſt of all ends, at the glory of our bleſſed Creator and Redeemer: This is
indeed to live: otherwiſe, we may have a being for a time upon earth, but a
life I cannot call it; and [[Page
158]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=78) when we muſt
ceaſe to be, we are neceſſarily ſwallowed up with the horror of either not
being at all, or of being e­ternally miſerable.

### 1.55. LV.

All our love is moved from ſome good which we appre­hend in the party loved;
car­nal love from beauty; world­ly from gain; ſpiritual from grace; divine,
from infinite goodneſs: It muſt needs be therefore, that when the ground and
motive of our love faileth, the affection it ſelf muſt ceaſe; thoſe that are
enamoured of a beautiful face, finde their paſſion cooled with a loathſome
deformity; thoſe that are led by the hopes of profit, like waſps, [[Page
159]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=78) leave buzzing
about the gal­ly-pot, when all the hony is gone; thoſe that could carry the
rod familiarly in their hand, run from it when they ſee it turnd to a Serpent:
Contrarily, when that which attracts our love is conſtant to it ſelf, and
everlaſting, the affection ſet upon it is perma­nent, and eternal: If then I
love God for riches, for pre­ferment, for my own in­dempnity; when intervening
croſſes ſtrip me of the hopes of all theſe, I ſhall be ready to ſay, with that
diſtemper­ed King of Iſrael: 2 Kings. 6. 33. Behold, this evil is of the Lord,
What ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer? If my reſpects to my Saviour be for
the loaves, and fiſhes; my heart is carried a­way [[Page
160]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=79) with thoſe
baskets of fragments: but if I can love God for his goodneſs ſake,Cant. 8. 6.
this love ſhall out-laſt time; and over-match death.

### 1.56. LVI.

What a wretched narrow­neſs of heart is this which I finde in my ſelf; that
when I may have all things, I take up with nothing; and when I may be
poſſeſſed of an infi­nite good, I pleaſe my ſelf in graſping a little thick
clay? It was a large word that the Apoſtle ſaid to his Corinthi­ans;1 Cor. 3.
22. Whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or
things preſent, or things to come, all are yours. What, ſhall we think they
were richer then their neigh­bors? [[Page
165]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=79) or is not this
the con­dition of all thoſe, of whom he can ſay in the next words, ye are
Chriſts? There, there comes in all our right to this infinite wealth; of our
ſelves we are beggars; in him, who is Lord of all, we are feoffed in all
things; for whiles he ſaith, All are yours, and ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is
Gods; he doth in effect ſay, Chriſt is yours, and in him, God is yours; for
this right is mutual: How elſe ſhould all things be ours, if God were not
ours; without whom all is no­thing? and how ſhould God the Father be ours,
without that Son of his love, who hath ſaid,Joh. 16. 15. All things that the
Father hath, Joh. 17. 21. are mine; Joh. 14. 6. Thou O Father art in me, and I
in thee: [[Page 162]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=80)
No man cometh to the Father, but by me? If then Chriſt be mine, all is mine:
and if I have ſo oft received him, and ſo often renued my union with him, how
is he but mine? O Saviour, let me feel my ſelf throughly poſ­ſeſt of thee,
whether the world ſlide, or ſink, I am happy.

### 1.57. LVII.

God will not vouchſafe to allow ſo much honor to wicked inſtruments, as to
make them the means of re­moving publike evils: The Magicians of Egypt could
have power to bring ſome plagues upon the Land, but had not the power to take
them away; Certainly, there [[Page
163]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=80) needed a
greater power to give a being to the frogs, then to call them off; yet this
lat­ter they cannot do who pre­vailed in the firſt: Moſes and Aaron muſt be
called to fetch off that judgment, which the Sorcerers have brought upon
themſelves; neither is it o­therwiſe ſtill: Wicked men can draw down thoſe
plagues upon a nation, which onely the faithful muſt remove: The ſins of the
one make work for the others inter­ceſſion: Do we therefore ſmart, and groan
under hea­vy calamities? we know to whom we are beholden:Jer. 14. 10, 12. Thus
ſaith the Lord to this people, thus have they loved to wander; they have not
refrained their feet, therefore he will now re­member [[Page
164]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=81) their iniquity,
and viſit their ſins; When they faſt, I will not hear their cry; and when they
offer burnt offrings and an oblation, I will not accept them; but I will
conſume them by the ſword, and by the famine, and by the peſtilence. Do we
deſire to be freed from the preſent evils and to eſcape an utter deſolation?
They are Moſes and Aaron that muſt do it; He ſaid that he would deſtroy them:
Pſal. 106. 23. had not Moſes his choſen ſtood before him in the breach to turn
away his wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them: When our quarrel is with Heaven,
it is not our force, or our policy that can ſave us: Every faith­ful man is a
favorite of the King of glory, and can do more then command Legi­ons: [[Page
165]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=81) Then is a
people in ſome good way towards ſafety, when they have learned to know their
friends. Whiles we have good mens prayers to grapple with wicked mens ſins,
there may be hopes of recovery.

### 1.58. LVIII.

The ayming at a good end can be no juſt excuſe for an unlawful act, or
diſpoſition; but if contentment did con­ſiſt in having much, it were a ſore
temptation to a man to be covetous; ſince that con­tentation is the thing
wherein the heart of man is wont to place it's chief felicity: nei­ther indeed
can there be any poſſible happineſs without it; but the truth is, abun­dance
[[Page 166]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=82) is no
whit guilty ſo much as of eaſe, much leſs of a full joy: how many have we
known that have ſpent, more pleaſed and happy hours, under an houſe of ſticks,
and walls of mud, and roof of ſtraw, then great Po­tentates have done under
marbles, and cedar? And how many, both wiſe Hea­then, and mortified
Chriſti­ans have rid their hands of their cumberſome ſtore, that they might be
capable of being happy? Other crea­tures do naturally neglect that which
abuſed reaſon bids us dote upon: If we had no bet­ter powers then beaſt, or
fowls, we ſhould not at all care for this either white, or red earth; and if
our graces [[Page
167]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=82) were as great
as the leaſt of Saints, we ſhould look care­leſly upon the preciouſeſt and
largeſt treaſures that the earth can afford; now our debauch­ed reaſon, in
ſtead of ſtir­ing us up to emulate the beſt creatures, draws us down below the
baſeſt of them; moving us to place our hap­pineſs in thoſe things which have
neither life, nor true worth; much leſs can give that which they have not; It
is not for the generous ſouls of Chriſtians to look ſo low, as to place their
contentment in any thing, whether within the bowels, or upon the face of this
earth; but to raiſe their thoughts up to the glo­rious region of their
original, and reſt: looking not at the [[Page
168]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=83) things which
are ſeen,2 Cor. 4. 18. but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things
that are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.

### 1.59. LIX.

The holy Pſalmiſt knew well what he ſaid when he called the thunder in the
clouds,Pſal. 29. 4. The voyce of the Lord: a voyce powerful and full of
Majeſty: The very Heathens made this the moſt awful act of their Jupiter;
which the Spirit of God expreſſes in a more divine language: The God of glory
thundreth; upon this dreadful ſound it is, that the Pſalmiſt calls to the
migh­ty ones,Pſal. 29. 3. to give unto the Lord glory and ſtrength, Pſal, 29.
1. 2. to give unto the Lord the glory due to his [[Page
169]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=83) name: as it
were adviſing the great Commanders of the world, when they hear it thunder, to
fall down on their knees, and to lift up their hands, and eyes, to that great
God that ſpeaks to them from Heaven: No man needs to bid the ſtouteſt heart to
fear, when this terrible ſound ſtrikes through his ear; which is able to drive
even Neroes and Caligulaes into bench-holes: But this mighty voyce calls for
an improve­ment of our fear, to the glo­ry of that Almighty power whence it
proceeds: Perhaps, the preſumption of man will be finding out the natural
cauſes of this fearful uproar in the clouds; but the work­ing by means
derogates no­thing [[Page
170]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=84) from the God of
nature; neither yet are all thunders natural: That whirlwind and thunder,
wherein God ſpake to Job; Job. 40. 9. 38. 1. that thunder and lightning
wherein God ſpake to Moſes and Iſrael in mount Sinai; Exod. 19. that thunder
and rain wherewith God anſwered the prayer of Samuel in wheat-harveſt,1 Sam.
12. 17, 8. for Iſraels conviction in the unſeaſonable ſuit for their King;
that thundering voyce from Heaven that an­ſwered the prayer of the Son of
God,Joh. 12. 28, 29. for the glorifying of his Name; the ſeven thun­ders that
uttered their voyces to the beloved Diſciple in Pathmos, Revel. 10. 3. 4. had
nothing of or­dinary nature in them: And how many have we heard, and read of,
That for ſleight­ing [[Page
171]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=84) of this great
work of God, have at once heard his voyce, and felt his ſtroke. Shortly, if
any heart can be unmoved at this mighty voyce of God, it is ſtiffer then the
rocks in the wilderneſs;Pſ. 29. 8. for, The voyce of the Lord ſhaketh the
wilder­neſs, the Lord ſhaketh the wil­derneſs of Kadeſh: For me, I tremble at
the power, whiles I adore the mercy of that great God, that ſpeaks ſo loud to
me: It is my com­fort that he is my Father, who approves himſelf thus
omni­potent; his love is no leſs in­finite then his power; let the terror be
to them that know him angry; let my confidence overcome my fear: It is the
Lord, let him do what he will: All is not right with me till I [[Page
172]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=85) have attained
to tremble at him while he ſhineth, and to rejoyce in him whiles he thundreth.

### 1.60. LX.

We talk of mighty warri­ors that have done great ex­ploits in conquering
king­doms; but the Spirit of God tells us of a greater conqueſt then all
theirs; Whatſoever is born of God overcometh the world; 1 Joh. 5. 4. and this
is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith; A­laſs, the conqueſt
of thoſe great Commanders was but poor and partial, of ſome ſmall ſpots of the
earth; the conqueſt of a regenerate Chriſtian is univerſal, of the whole
world: Thoſe other [[Page
173]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=85) conquerors,
whiles they pre­vailed abroad, were yet o­vercome at home: and whiles they
were the Lords of nati­ons, were no other then vaſ­ſals to their own luſts:
Theſe begin their victories at home, and enlarge their Triumphs over all their
ſpiritual ene­mies: The glory of thoſe o­ther victors was laid down with their
bodies in the duſt; the glory that attends theſe, is eternal; What pity it is
that the true Chriſtian ſhould not know his own greatneſs; that he may raiſe
his thoughts accordingly; and bear him­ſelf as one that tramples the world
under his feet? For all that is in the world, 1 Joh. 2. 16. is the luſt of the
fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life; theſe he [[Page
174]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=86) hath truly
ſubdued in him­ſelf; not ſo as to bereave them of life, but of rule; if he
have left them ſome kinde of being ſtill in him, yet he hath left them no
dominion; and therefore may well ſtile him­ſelf the Lord of the world: Far,
far therefore be it from him, that he ſhould ſo abject, and debaſe himſelf, as
to be a ſlave to his vaſſals: none but holy and high thoughts, and demeanors,
may now beſeem him; and in theſe ſpiritual regards of his inward great­neſs,
and ſelf-conqueſts, his word muſt be; either Ceſar, or nothing.

### 1.61. LXI.

I ſee ſo many kindes of phrenſies in the world, and [[Page
175]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=86) ſo many
ſeemingly wiſe brains taken with them, that I much doubt whom I may be ſure to
account free from either the touch, or (at leaſt) the danger of this
indiſpoſiti­on; How many opinions do I ſee raiſed every day, that argue no
leſs then a meer ſpiritual madneſs? ſuch as if they ſhould have been but
mentioned ſeven years ago, would have been queſtioned out of what Bedlam they
had broken looſe. And for diſ­poſitions; how do we ſee one ſo ragingly
furious, as if he had newly torn off his chaines, and eſcaped; ano­ther ſo
ſtupidly ſenſeleſs, that you may thruſt pins into him, up to the head, and he
ſtartles not at it: One ſo [[Page
176]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=87) dumpiſhly ſad,
as if he would freez to death in melancholy, and hated any contentment but in
ſorrow; another ſo apiſhly jocund, as if he cared for no other paſtime then to
play with feathers: One ſo ſuperſtitiouſly devout, that he is ready to cringe,
and crouch to every ſtock; ano­ther ſo wildly prophane, that he is ready to
ſpit God in the face: ſhortly, one ſo cenſori­ous of others, as if he thought
all men mad but himſelf; an­other ſo mad, as that he thinks himſelf and all
mad men ſo­ber, and well-witted.

In this ſtore and variety of diſtempers (were I not ſure of my own principles)
I could eaſily miſdoubt my ſelf; now, ſetled on firm grounds, I can [[Page
177]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=87) pity and bewail
the woful diſtraction of many; and can but ſend them for recovery to that
divine wiſdom, who calls to them in the openings of the gates, and uttereth
her words, ſaying; Prov. 1. 22. How long ye ſilly ones will ye love
ſimplicity? and the ſcorners delight in their ſcorn­ing, and fools hate
knowledg; turn you at my reproof:Prov. 8. 5. O ye ſim­ple underſtand wiſdom,
and ye fools be ye of an underſtanding heart:Prov. 8. 34, 36. Bleſſed is the
man that heareth me, watching daily at my ga [...]es: But he that ſinneth
againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul: all they that hate me, love death.

### 1.62. LXII.

Man, as he confiſts of a double nature, fleſh and ſpi­rit, ſo is he placed in
a middle [[Page 178]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=88)
rank betwixt an angel, which is ſpirit, and a beaſt, which is fleſh; partaking
of the qualities, and performing the acts of both: he is angelical in his
underſtanding, in his ſenſual affections, beaſtial: and to whether of theſe he
moſt enclineth, and con­formeth himſelf, that part wins more of the other, and
gives a denomination to him; ſo as, he that was before half angel, half beaſt,
if he be drowned in ſenſuality, hath loſt the angel, and is become a beaſt; if
he be wholly taken up with heavenly Me­ditations, he hath quit the beaſt, and
is improved an­gelical: It is hard to hold an equal temper; either he muſt
degenerate into a beaſt, or be [[Page
179]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=88) advanced to an
angel; meer reaſon ſufficiently appre­hends the difference of the condition:
Could a beaſt be capable of that faculty, he would wiſh to be a man, ra­ther
then a brute, as he is: There is not more difference betwixt a man, and beaſt,
then between an angel and a brutiſh man; How muſt I needs therefore be worſe
then beaſt, if, when I may be pre­ferred to that happy honor, I ſhall rather
affect to be a beaſt, then an angel? Away then with the beſtial delights of
the ſenſual appetite; let not my ſoul ſink in this mud; let me be wholly for
thoſe intel­lectual pleaſures which are pure and ſpiritual: and let my
ambition be, to come as [[Page
180]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=89) neer to the
Angel as this clog of my fleſh will permit.

### 1.63. LXIII.

There is great difference in mens diſpoſitions under affli­ction: Some there
are, dead­hearted patients, that grow mopiſh and ſtupid, with too deep a ſence
of their ſuffer­ings; others out of a careleſs jollity are inſenſible even of
ſharp and heavy croſſes: We are wont to ſpeak of ſome, whoſe inchanted fleſh
is in­vulnerable; this is the ſtate of thoſe hearts, which are ſo bewitched
with worldly pleaſur [...]s, that they are not to be peirced with any
cala­mity, that may befal them in their eſtates, children, husbands, wives,
friends; [[Page 181]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=89)
ſo as they can ſay with Solo­mons drunkard,Prov. 23. 35. They have ſtricken me
and I was not ſick, they have beaten me but I felt it not; Theſe are dead
fleſh, which do no more feel the knife, then if it did not at all enter; for
whom ſome corro­ſives are neceſſary to make them capable of ſmart: This
diſpoſition, though it ſeem to carry a face of Fortitude, and Patience, yet is
juſtly offenſive; and not a little in­jurious both to God, and the ſoul: To
God; whom it in­deavors to fruſtrate of thoſe holy ends which he pro­poſeth to
himſelf in our ſufferings; for wherefore doth he afflict us, if he would not
have us afflicted? where­fore doth the father whip [[Page
182]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=90) the childe, but
that he would have him ſmart; and by ſmarting bettered? he looks for cryes and
tears; and the childe that weeps not under the rod is held graceleſs: To the
ſoul, whom it robs of the benefit of our ſuffering; for what uſe can there be
of patience where there is no ſence of evil? and how can patience have its
perfect work, where it is not?

Betwixt both theſe ex­treams, if we would have our ſouls proſper, a mid-
diſpoſi­tion muſt be attained; we muſt be ſo ſenſible of evils, that we be not
ſtupified with them; and ſo re [...]olute under our croſſes, that we may be
truly ſenſible of them: not ſo brawned under the rod, that [[Page
183]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=90) we ſhould not
feel it; nor yet ſo tender that we ſhould over-feel it: not more pa­tient
under the ſtripe, then willing to kiſs the hand that inflicts it.

### 1.64. LXIV.

God as he is one, ſo he loves ſingleneſs and ſimplici­ty in the inward parts:
as therefore he hath been plea­ſed to give us thoſe ſences double, whereby we
might let in for our ſelves, as our eyes, and ears; and thoſe limbs double,
whereby we might act for our ſelves, as our hands and feet; ſo thoſe which he
would appropriate to himſelf, as our hearts for beleef, and our tongue for
confeſſion, he hath given us [[Page
184]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=91) ſingle; neither
did he ever ordain, or can abide two hearts in a boſome, two tongues in one
mouth: It is then the hateful ſtile, which the Spirit of God gives to an
hypocrite;Jam. 4. 8. that he is double­minded; In the language of Gods Spirit,
a fool hath no heart, and a diſſembler hath an heart, and an heart; and
ſurely, as a man that hath two heads is a monſter in nature, ſo he that hath
two hearts is no leſs a ſpiritual monſter to God: For the holy and wiſe God
hath made one for one; One minde, or ſoul, for one body: And if the regenerate
man have two men in one; the old man, and the new; yet it is ſo, as that one
is fleſh, the other ſpirit; the minde [[Page
185]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=91) then is not
double; but the law of the mind is oppoſed to the law of the fleſh;Rom. 7. 23.
ſo as here are ſtrivings, in one heart, not the ſidings of two: for ſurely,
the God of unity can neither indure multiplication, nor diviſion of hearts, in
one breſt: If then we have one heart for God, another for Mammon, we may be
ſure God will not own this latter; how ſhould he, for he made it not? Yea,
moſt juſtly will he diſclaim both, ſince that which he made was but one, this
double. And as the wiſe man hath told us, That God hates nothing which he hath
made; ſo may we truly ſay, God hateth whatſoever he made not; ſince what he
made not, is onely evil: [[Page
186]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=92) When I have
done my beſt, I ſhall have but a weak and a faulty heart; but, Lord, let it be
but a ſingle one:Pſal. 134. 23, 24. Search me, O God, and know my heart, try
me, and know my thoughts: and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
me in the way everlaſting.

### 1.65. LXV.

There is a kinde of not-be­ing in ſin; for ſin is not an exiſtence of ſomewhat
that is, but a deficiency of that recti­tude which ſhould be: it is a
privation, but not without a real miſchief; as blindneſs is but a privation of
ſight, but a true miſery: Now, a priva­tion cannot ſtand alone; it muſt have
ſome ſubject to lean upon; there is no blind­neſs [[Page
187]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=92) but where there
is an eye, no death but where there hath been a life: ſin therefore ſup­poſes
a ſoul, wherein it is, and an act whereto it clea­veth: and thoſe acts of ſin
are they which the Apoſtle calls the works of darkneſs▪ Eph. 5. 12. So as
there is a kinde of operoſity in ſin, in regard whereof ſin­ners are
ſtiled,Luk. 13. 27. The workers of iniquity: And ſurely there are ſins,
wherein there is more toyl and labor, then in the holieſt actions: What pains
and care doth the theef take in ſetting his match, in watching for his prey?
How doth he ſpend the darkeſt and coldeſt nights in the executi­on of his
plot? What fears, what flights, what hazards, what ſhifts are here to a­voyd
[[Page 188]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=93) notice
and puniſhment?

The adulterer ſays, That ſtoln waters are ſweet; but that ſweet is ſauced to
him with many careful thoughts, with many deadly dangers: The ſuperſtitious
bygot, who is himſelf beſotted with er­ror, how doth he traverſe Sea and land
to make a Proſe­lyte? What adventures doth he make, what perils doth he run,
what deaths doth he challenge, to mar a ſoul?

So as ſome men take more pains to go to Hell, then ſome others do, to go to
Heaven: O the ſottiſhneſs of ſinners, that with a temporary miſery will needs
purchaſe an eter­nal! How ſhould we think no pains ſufficient for the
at­taining of Heaven, when we [[Page
189]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=93) ſee wretched
men toyl ſo much for damnation?

### 1.66. LXVI.

With what elegance and force doth the holy Ghoſt ex­preſs our Saviours leaving
of the world; which he cals his taking home again;Luk. 9. 51. or his
re­ceiving up? In the former, implying, That the Son of God was, for the time,
ſent out of his Fathers houſe, to theſe lower regions of his exile, or
pilgrimage, and was now re-admitted into thoſe his glorious manſions; In the
latter, ſo intimating his triumphant aſcenſion, that he paſſeth over his
bitter paſſion: Surely, he was to take death in his way; ſo he told his
Diſciples, in the walk to [[Page
190]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=94) Emaus: Luk. 24.
26. Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and to enter into his glory? He
muſt be lift­ed up to the Croſs, ere his Aſ­cenſion to Heaven; but, as if the
thought of death were ſwallowed up in the bleſſed iſſue of his death, here is
no mention of ought but his aſſumption: Lo, death truly ſwallowed up in
victory: Neither is it otherwiſe pro­portionally with us: wholly ſo it cannot
be; for, as for him, Death did but taſte of him, could not devour him, much
leſs put him over; It could not but yield him whole & entire the third day,
without any impairing of his nature; yea, with an happy addition to it, of a
glorious immortality: and in that glo­rified [[Page
191]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=94) humanity he
aſcended by his own Power into his Heaven: For us, we muſt be content that one
part of us lye rotting for the time, in the duſt, whiles our ſpiritual part
ſhall by the miniſtery of An­gels be received up to thoſe everlaſting
habitations: Here is an Aſſumption therefore, true and happy, though not, as
yet, total: And why ſhould I not therefore have my heart taken up with the
aſſured expectation of this receiving up into my glory? Why do I not look
beyond death, at the eternally-bleſſed condition of this ſoul of mine; which
in my diſſolu­tion is thus crowned with im­mortality? So doth the Sea­beaten
Marriner chear up [[Page
192]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=95) himſelf with
the ſight of that Heaven, which he makes for; So doth the Travailer com­fort
himſelf, when after a tempeſtuous ſtorm he ſees the Sun breaking forth in his
brightneſs.

I am dying; but, O Savi­our, Joh. 11. 23. thou art the reſurrection and the
life; he that beleeves in thee, though he be dead yet ſhall he live:Eſa. 26.
19. Awake, and ſing ye that dwel in the duſt; for thy dew is as the dew of
herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead: Bleſſed are the dead that dye in
the Lord for they reſt from their labors, and their works follow them.

### 1.67. LXVII.

What need I be troubled that I finde in my ſelf a fear of [[Page
193]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=95) Death? what
Iſraelite is not ready to run away at the ſight of this Goliah? This fear is
natural; and ſo far from being evil, that it was inci­dent into the Son of
God, who was heard in that which he feared; Chriſtianity ſerves not to
deſtroy, but to rectifie nature. Grace regulates this paſſion in us, and
corrects the exorbitances of it, never intended to root it out: Let me
therefore entertain this fear, but ſo, as that I may maſter it; if I cannot
avoyd fear, let it be ſuch as may be incident into a faithful man: Whiles my
fear apprehends juſt terror in the face of Death, let my faith lay faſt hold
on that bleſſed Saviour, who hath both overcome, [[Page
194]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=96) and ſweetned
it; on that bleſſed eſtate of glory which accompanies it; my fear ſhall end in
joy, my death in ad­vantage.

### 1.68. LXVIII.

It is too plain that we are faln upon the old age of the world; the laſt
times, and therefore neareſt to the diſ­ſolution; and if time it ſelf did not
evince it, the diſ­poſition and qualities would moſt evidently do it; For to
what a cold temper of charity are we grown? what meer Ice is in theſe
ſpiritual veins? the unnatural and unkindly fluſhings of ſelf-love abound
indeed every where; but for true Chriſtian love it is come to old Davids paſs,
it may [[Page 195]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=96)
be covered with clothes,1 King. 1. 1. but it can get no heat: Beſides, what
whimſies, and fancies of dotage do we finde the world poſſeſſed withal,
be­yond the examples of all for­mer times? what wilde and mad opinions have
been late­ly broached, which the ſetled brains of better ages could never have
imagined? Unto theſe, how extreamly cho­lerick the world is grown, in theſe
later times, there needs no other proof then the effu­ſion of ſo much blood in
this preſent age, as many preced­ing centuries of years have been ſparing to
ſpill.

What ſhould I ſpeak of the moral diſtempers of diſeaſes, the confluence
whereof hath made this age more wicked­ly-miſerable [[Page
196]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=97) then all the
former? for, when ever was there ſo much prophane­neſs, atheiſm, blaſphemy,
ſchiſm, exceſs, diſobedience, oppreſſion, licentiouſneſs, as we now ſigh
under? Laſtly, that which is the common fault of age, loquacity, is a plain
evidence of the worlds declinedneſs: for, was there ever age guilty of ſo much
tongue, and pen as this laſt? were ever the Preſſes ſo cloy­ed with frivolous
work? E­very man thinks what he liſts, and ſpeaks what he thinks, and writes
what he ſpeaks, and prints what he writes; Neither would the world talk ſo
much, did it not make account it cannot talk long. What ſhould we do then,
[[Page 197]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=97) ſince we
know the world truly old, and now going upon his great, and fatal
Climacterical, but as diſcreet men would carry themſelves to impotent and
decrepit age; bear with the infirmities of it, pity and bewail the diſtempers,
ſtrive againſt the enormities, and prepare for the diſſolution.

### 1.69. LXIX.

There cannot be a ſtronger motive to awe and obedience, then that which Saint
Peter enforceth;1 Pet. 1. 17. That God is both a Father and a Judg: The one is
a title of Love and Mercy; the other of Juſtice. What ever God is, he is all
that; he is all Love and Mercy; He is all Juſtice; He is not ſo a Judg, that
he hath [[Page 198]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=98)
waved the title and affection of a Father: He is not ſo a Fa­ther that he will
remit ought of his infinite juſtice as a Judg: He is, he will ever be both
theſe in one; and we muſt faſten our eyes upon both theſe at once; and be
accordingly affected unto both: He is a Father, there­fore here muſt be a
loving awe; He is a Judg, and there­fore here muſt be an awful love and
obedience. So muſt we lay hold upon the tender mercies of a Father that we may
rejoyce continually; ſo muſt we apprehend the Juſtice of a righteous Judg,
that we do lovingly tremble; Why then ſhould man deſ­pair? God is a father;
All the bowels of mortal and hu­mane [[Page
199]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=98) love,Iſa. 49.
15. are ſtraight to his: Can a woman forget her ſucking childe, that ſhe
ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget; yet
will I not forget thee: ſaith the Lord. That which is the title of his
perſonality in di­vine relation, is alſo the title of his gracious relation to
us, Father; neither can he be other then he is ſtyled; And contrarily how dare
man pre­ſume, ſince this Father is a Judg? It is for ſinful fleſh and blood to
be partial; fooliſh parents may be apt to connive at the ſins of their own
loyns, or bowels, be­cauſe theirs; either they will not ſee them, or not hate
them, or not cenſure them, or not puniſh them: The infinite [[Page
200]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=99) juſtice of a
God cannot wink at our failings: There is no debt of our ſin, but muſt be paid
in our ſelves, or our ſurety:1 Pet. 1. 17. If then we call him Father, who
without reſpect of perſons judgeth according to every mans work; why do we not
paſs the time of our ſojourn­ing here in fear?

### 1.70. LXX.

How terrible a motion was that, (which was made by the two Diſciples) of
com­manding fire to come down from Heaven, and conſume the inhoſpital
Samaritans? Me thinks, I could tremble but at the imagination of ſo dreadful a
judgment, as they did not fear to ſue for; Yet if we look to the offence, it
was [[Page 201]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=99) no
poſitive act of indignity offered to Chriſt; but the meer not lodging of his
train; and that, not out of a rude inhumanity, but out of a re­ligious
ſcruple: what could they have ſaid if theſe Sama­ritans had purſued them with
ſwords, and ſtaves, and ſtones? Whom ſhall we hope to finde free from cruelty
of revenge, when even the Diſciple of Love was thus over-taken? What wonder is
it if natural men be tranſported with fu­rious deſires, when ſo emi­nent
Domeſticks, and follow­ers of our Saviour were thus faulty? Surely nature in
man is cruel; neither is there any creature under Heaven ſo bloody to its own
kinde: Even Bears and Wolves, and [[Page
202]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=100) Tigers devour
not one ano­ther; and if any of them fall out in ſingle combats for a prey,
here is no publique en­gaging for blood; neither do they affect to enjoy each
o­thers torment; rather enter­taining one anothers com­plaints with pity; Let
but a ſwine cry, the reſt of the herd within the noyſe, come run­ing in, to
ſee and compaſſion­ate his pain; onely man re­joyces in the miſery of the ſame
fleſh and blood with himſelf, and loves to triumph in his revenge: whiles we
are thus affected, we know not of what ſpirit we are; we may ſoon learn; we
are even of that ſpirit who was a man­ſlayer from the beginning; Joh. 8. 44.
as for the good ſpirit, his juſt [[Page
203]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=100) ſtyle is the
preſerver of men; Job. 7. 20. and the errand of the ſon of man was,Luk. 9▪ 56.
not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave to them: and his charge to theſe, and
all other his diſciples;Luk. 6. 36. Be mercifull, as your Father alſo is
merciful and how eaſily may we obſerve that this very diſciple (as if in way
of abundant ſatisfaction for this raſh over-ſight) calls more for love, then
all the reſt of his maſters train, tel­ling us that God is love, 1 Joh. 4. 16.
and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him: and, Beloved,
let us love one ano­ther: 1 Joh. 4. 7. For love is of God; and every one that
loveth is of God, and knoweth God: 1 Joh. 4. 8. He that loveth not, knoweth
not God: for God is love. Shortly then, what would not this holy [[Page
204]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=101) diſciple have
given to have recalled this fiery motion? The more mercy and charity is in us,
the more we have of God; the more fury, and re­venge; of Satan.

### 1.71. LXXI.

Much caution muſt be had in our imitation of the actions of the holieſt:
cautions, both in reſpect of the perſons, and of the actions: God himſelf;
yea, God cloathed in fleſh, (though the pattern of all perfection) is not for
our uni­verſal imitation; the moſt of their actions are for our won­der, not
for our exampling; and amongſt men; how ab­ſurd were it in a Peaſant to
imitate a King? or one of the long robe, a Souldier? [[Page
205]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=101) If Moſes
climbe up the hill of God, Sinai; ſhall another Iſraelite ſay, Moſes goes up,
why not I? So he might have paid dear for his pre­ſumption: Moſes was called
up, the reſt were limited; and if a beaſt touch the hill, he ſhall dye. That
act may beſeem one, which would be very incongruous in another; The dog fawns
upon his ma­ſter, and hath his back ſtroaked; if the Aſs do the like, he is
beaten: We are naturally apt to be carried with examples: It is one of the
greateſt improvements of wiſedom to know, whom, in what, and how far we may
imitate:Phil. 3. 17. The beſt have their weakneſſes;1 Cor. 4. 16. there is no
copy without a blur:1 Cor. 11. 1. Be ye fol­lowers [[Page
206]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=102) of me, ſaith
the choſen Veſſel; but how? Even as I am of Chriſt: It is ſafe follow­ing him
that cannot erer.

### 1.72. LXXII.

God who is ſimply one, infinitely perfect, abſolutely compleat in himſelf,
enjoys himſelf fully, from all eter­nity, without any relation to the
creature: but knowing our wants, and weakneſſes, he hath ordained a ſociety
for our well-being; and therefore even in mans innocency, could ſay, It is not
good for man to be alone: And why Lord? why might not man have taken pleaſure
enough in the beauty and ſweetneſs of his Paradiſe, in contempla­ting thine
Heaven, in the [[Page
207]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=102) command of
thine obſequi­ous creatures, and above all, in the fruition of thy divine
preſence, in that happy inte­grity of his nature without any acceſſion of
other helps? Surely, thou who kneweſt well what diſpoſition thou hadſt put
into him, intend­edſt to fit him with all meet conveniences: and thou who
madeſt him ſociable, before he could have any ſocie­ty; thoughtſt fit to ſtead
him with ſuch a ſociety, as might make his life comfort­able to him. Wiſe
Solomon obſerves it out of his deep ex­perience,Eccl. 4. 7, 8, 9. for a vanity
under the Sun, That there is one alone, and there is not a ſecond; and that,
two are better then one, becauſe they have a good reward for their labor.

[[Page 208]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=103) In the
Plantation of the Evangelical Church, the A­poſtles are not reckoned
ſin­gle,Matt. 10. 2, 3, 4, but by pairs; and ſo doth their Lord ſend them upon
the great errand of his Goſpel: And when he ſe­conded that Work by a
com­miſſion given to his ſeventy Diſciples;Luke. 10. 1. He ſent them two and
two before his face, into every City and place, whither he himſelf would come▪
After this, when our Saviour had left the earth, Paul and Barnabas go
together; and when they are parted, Paul and Silas, Bar­nabas and Mark are
ſorted: Single indeavors ſeldom proſ­per; many hands make the work both quick
and ſure: They can be no friends to the happy eſtate of a Family or [[Page

labor to cauſe diſtractions; Diviſion makes certain way for ruine.

### 1.73. LXXIII.

Under the Law there was difference, as of Ages, ſo of Sexes: Circumciſion was
ap­propriated to the Male: In the Temple there was the Court of the Jews; and
without that, the Court of the Women; neither might that Sex go beyond their
bounds; and ſtill it is ſo in their Jewiſh Synagogues: But in Chriſt, there is
neither Male, nor Female. As the ſoul hath no Sex; ſo God makes no difference
in the ac­ceptation of either: As it is the honor of the one Sex, that Chriſt
the Son of God was a [[Page
210]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=104) man; ſo it is
the honor of the other Sex, that he was born of a woman: And if the woman be
(as ſhe is in nature) the weaker veſſel, yet ſhe is no leſs capable of Grace,
then the ſtronger; as the thineſt glaſs may receive as precious liquor, as the
beſt plate▪ Good Anna as well as Simeon, Luk. 2. 38. gave glory to their new-
born Saviour, to all that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem: And afterwards,
the holy women were no leſs zealous attend­ants of Chriſt, both in his life
and death,Luk. 8. 2, 3. then the moſt forward Diſciples; yea, they followed
him, when his do­meſtick followers forſook him; neither could be parted by
either his Croſs, or his Grave.

[[Page 211]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=104) And
they were the firſt that were honored with the no­tice, and meſſage of their
Saviours bleſſed Reſurrecti­on,Joh. 20. 17. and Aſcenſion; then which, what
imployment could be more noble? The Lord gave the word, Pſal. 68. 11. ſaith
the Pſalmiſt, great was the com­pany of the Preachereſſes; the word is
Feminine: However therefore in natural, and po­litique reſpects, the
Philo­ſopher might have ſome rea­ſon to bleſs God, that he had made him a man,
and not a woman; yet in ſpiritual (which are the beſt) regards, here is no
inequality; ſo that it is the great mercy and good­neſs of our common Creator,
that though he hath made a difference in the ſmalleſt mat­ters, [[Page
212]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=105) yet he makes
none in the greateſt;King Iames his preface monitory. and that he ſo
in­differently peoples Heaven with both Sexes, that, for ought we know, the
greateſt Saint there, is of the weaker Sex.

### 1.74. LXXIV.

There is nothing more eaſie then for a man to be courageous in a time of
ſafety; and to defie thoſe dangers which he neither feels nor ſees. Whiles the
coaſt is clear, every man can be ready to ſay, with Peter; Though all men,
Mark. 14. 31. yet not I; If I ſhould dye with thee, I will not deny thee in
any wiſe: But when the evil hour cometh, when our enemy appears armed in the
liſts, ready to encounter [[Page
213]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=105) us, then to
call up our ſpirits, and to grapple reſolutely with dangers and death, it is
the praiſe and proof of a true Chriſtian valour▪

And this is that which the Apoſtle calls ſtanding; Epheſ. 6. 13, 14. in
op­poſition to both falling, and fleeing: Falling, out of faint­neſs, and
fleeing for fear. It ſhall not be poſſible for us thus to ſtand, if we ſhall
truſt to our own feet; In, and of our ſelves, the beſt of us are but meer
cowards; neither can be able ſo much as to look our enemy in the face: Would
we be perfect victors? we muſt go out of our ſelves, into the God of our
ſtrength: If we have made him ours, who ſhall, yea, who can be againſt
us?Phil. 4. 13. We can do all [[Page
214]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=106) things through
him that ſtrengthens us: Phil. 4. 13. All things; therefore conquer Death and
Hell: If we be weakneſs, he is omnipotence;Rom. 13. 14. Put we on the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt by a lively Faith, what enemy can come within us, to do us
hurt?Pſal. 56. 3, 4. What time I am afraid, I will truſt in thee, O God: In
thee, O God, have I truſted, I will not fear what (either) fleſh (or ſpirit)
can do unto me: The Lord is my rock, Pſal. 18. 2, 3. and my fortreſs, and my
deliverer; my God, my ſtrength, in whom I will truſt, my buckler, and the horn
of my ſalvation; I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praiſed; ſo
ſhall I be ſaved from mine enemies.

### 1.75. LXXV.

It is diſparagement enough that the Apoſtle caſts upon all the viſible things
of this world,2 Cor. 4. 18. That the things which are ſeen are temporary: Be
they never ſo glorious, yet being tranſitory, they cannot be worthy of our
hearts: Who would care for an houſe of glaſs, if never ſo curiouſly painted,
and gilded? All things that are meaſured by time, are thus brittle: Bodily
ſubſtances of what kinde ſo­ever, lye open to the eye; and being ſeen, can be
in no other, then a fading condition; even that goodly Fabrick of Hea­ven,
which we ſee, and ad­mire, muſt be changed, and in a ſort diſſolved: How
[[Page 216]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=107) much
more vaniſhing are all earthly glories?2 Pet. 3. 7. 12, and by how much
ſhorter their continu­ance is, ſo much lower muſt be their valuation: We
ac­count him fooliſh that will dote too much upon a flower, though never ſo
beautiful; becauſe we know it can be but a moneths pleaſure; and no care, no
art can preſerve it from withering; amongſt the reſt the Hemerocallis is the
leaſt eſteemed, becauſe one day ends its beauty: what madneſs then were it in
us to ſet our hearts upon theſe periſhing contentments which we muſt ſoon
mutually leave, we them, they us: Eternity is that onely thing which is worthy
to take up the thoughts of a wiſe man; [[Page
217]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=107) That being
added to evil makes the evil infinitely more intolerable; and being added to
good, makes the good in­finitely more deſireable.

O Eternity! thou bottom­leſs abyſs of miſery to the wicked; thou
indeterminable pitch of joy to the Saints of God; what ſoul is able to
comprehend thee? what ſtrength of underſtanding is able to conceive of thee?
Be thou ever in my thoughts, ever before mine eyes: Be thou the ſcope of all
my acti­ons, of all my indeavors: and in reſpect of thee, let all this viſible
world be to mee as nothing: And ſince onely the things which are not ſeen by
the eye of ſenſe are eternal; Lord, ſharpen thou the eyes [[Page
218]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=108) of my faith
that I may ſee thoſe things inviſible, and may in that ſight, enjoy thy
bleſſed eternity.

### 1.76. LXXVI.

What is all the world to us in compariſon of the Bird in our boſome, our
conſcience? In vain ſhall all the world ac­quite, and magnifie us, if that
ſecretly condemn us; and if that condemn us not,1 Joh. 3. 21. We have
confidence towards God, and may bid defiance to men and devils: Now that it
may not condemn us; it muſt be both pacified, and purged: paci­fied in reſpect
of the guilt of ſin purged in reſpect of the corruption:

For ſo long as there is guilt in the ſoul, the clamors of an [[Page
219]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=108) accuſing, and
condemning conſcience can no more be ſtilled, then the waters of the Sea can
ſtand ſtill in a ſtorm: There is then no pacification without removing the
guilt of ſin; no removing of guilt without remiſſion; no re­miſſion without
ſatisfaction; no ſatisfaction without a price of infinite value anſwerable to
the infiniteneſs of the Juſtice offended: and this is no where to be had, but
in the blood of Chriſt, God, and Man: All created and finite powers are but
miſera­ble comforters, Phyſitians of no value, to this one.

And the ſame power that pacifieth the conſcience from the guilt, muſt alſo
purge it from the filthineſs of ſin;Heb. 9. 14. [[Page
220]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=109) even that
blood of the Son of God,Heb. 9. 14. who is made unto us of God, 1 Joh. 1. 7.
Sanctification and Redemp­tion: That Faith which brings Chriſt home to the
ſoul, doth by the efficacy of his bleſſed Spirit,Act. 15. 9. purifie the heart
from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit: Being juſtified by this faith,
we have peace with God: When once the heart is quiet­ed from the uproars of
ſelf­accuſation, and cleanſed from dead works; what in this world can ſo much
concern us, as to keep it ſo? Which ſhall be done, if we ſhall give Chriſt the
poſſeſſion of our ſouls, and commit the keys into his onely hands; ſo ſhall
nothing be ſuffered to enter in, that may diſturb or defile it; if we ſhall
ſettle firm [[Page
221]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=109) reſolutions in
our breſts, never to yield to the com­miſſion of any known, enor­mious ſin:
Failings and ſlips there will be in the holieſt of Gods Saints, whiles they
carry their clay about them; For theſe we are allowed to fetch forth a pardon
of courſe from that infinite mer­cy of our God,Zechar. 13. 1. who hath ſet a
Fountain open to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for
ſin, and for uncleanneſs; by the force of our daily prayers: But if, through
an over-bold ſecuri­ty, and ſpiritual negligence, we ſhall ſuffer our ſelves
to be drawn away into ſome hei­nous wickedneſs, it muſt coſt warm water to
recover us: Neither can it, in ſuch a caſe, [[Page
222]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=110) be ſafe for
us, to ſuffer our eyes to ſleep, or our eye-lids to ſlumber, till we have made
our peace with Heaven: This done, and carefully maintain­ed, what can make us
other then happily ſecure? Bleſſed is he whoſe conſcience hath not condemned
him, Ecclu. 14. 2. and who is not faln from his hope in the Lord.

### 1.77. LXXVII.

We cannot apprehend Hea­ven in any notion but of ex­cellency, and glory; that
as it is in it ſelf a place of won­derful reſplendance, and Ma­jeſty; ſo it is
the Palace of the moſt high God, wherein he exhibites his infinite
magni­ficence; that it is the happy receptacle of all the elect of [[Page
223]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=110) God; that it
is the glorious rendezvous of the bleſſed Angels; that we have parents,
children, husband, wife, brothers, ſiſters, friends whom we dearly loved,
there: For ſuch is the power of love that it can endeare any place to us where
the party affected, is; much more the beſt; If it be a loathſome gaol, our
affection can make it a delightful bower; yea the very grave cannot keep us
off: The women could ſay of Ma­ry, that ſhe was gone to the grave of Lazarus
to weep there: and the zeal of thoſe holy clyents of Chriſt carries them to
ſeek their (as they ſuppoſed ſtill dead) Saviour, even in his Tomb: Above all
conceivable apprehenſions [[Page
224]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=111) then, wherein
Heaven is en­deared to us, there is none comparable to that, which the Apoſtle
enforceth to us, that, there Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God: Coloſ.
3. 1. If we have an hus­band, wife, childe, whom we dearly love, pent up in
ſome Tower or Caſtle afar off, whi­ther we are not allowed to have acceſs; how
many long­ing eyes do we caſt thither; how do we pleaſe our ſelves to think,
within thoſe walls is he incloſed whom my ſoul lo­veth; and who is incloſed in
my heart; but if it may be poſ­ſible to have paſſage (though with ſome
difficulty and dan­ger) to the place, how gladly do we put our ſelves upon the
adventure? When therefore we hear and certainly know [[Page
225]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=111) that our moſt
dear Saviour is above, in all heavenly glory; and that the Heavens muſt
contain him till his coming again, with what full content­ment of heart ſhould
we look up thither? How ſhould we break thorow all theſe ſecular diſtractions,
and be carried up by our affections (which are the wings of the ſoul) towards
an happy fruition of him? Good old Jacob, when he heard that his dearling ſon
was yet alive, in Egypt, how doth he gather up his ſpirits, and takes up a
cheerful reſolution, Joſeph my ſon is yet alive, Gen. 45. 26. I will go and
ſee him before I dye? Do we think his heart was any more in Canaan, after he
heard where his Joſeph was? And ſhall we, when we hear, [[Page
226]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=112) and know,
where our deareſt Saviour (typified by that good Patriark) is; that he is gone
before to provide a place for us in the rich Goſhen above, ſhall we be
heartleſs in our deſires towards him, and take up with earth? How many poor
ſouls take tedious, coſtly, perilous voy­ages to that land (which one­ly the
bodily preſence of our Saviour could denominate holy, their own wickedneſs
juſtly ſtiles accurſed) onely to ſee the place, where our dear Saviour trod;
where he ſtood, where he ſate, lay, ſet his laſt footing; and finde a kinde of
contentment in this ſacred curioſity, returning yet, never the holier, never
the happier; how then ſhould I be affected [[Page
227]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=112) with the ſight
of that place, where he is now in perſon, ſitting gloriouſly at the right hand
of Majeſty, adored by all the powers of Heaven? Let it be a covenant between
me and my eyes, never to look up at Heaven, (as how can I look beſide it?) but
I ſhall, in the ſame inſtant, think of my bleſſed Saviour, ſitting there in
his glorified humanity, united to the incomprehenſible — glorious Deity,
attended and wor­ſhiped by thouſand thou­ſands of Saints and Angels, preparing
a place for me and all his elect in thoſe eternal Manſions.

### 1.78. LXXVIII.

How lively doth the Spirit [[Page
228]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=113) of God
deſcribe the heaven­ly affections of faithful Abra­ham; that he looked for a
city which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God: Heb. 11. 10. What
city was this, but the celeſtial Jeruſalem, the glori­ous ſeat of the Great
Empire of Heaven? The main ſtrength of any building is in the foundation; if
that be firm and ſure, the fabrick well knit together will ſtand: but if that
be either not laid, or lye looſe and unſetled, the tottering frame doth but
wait upon the next wind for a ruine: The good Patriark had been uſed to dwell
in Tents, which were not cap­able of a foundation: It is like, he and his
anceſtors wanted not good houſes in [[Page
229]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=113) Chaldea, where
they were formerly planted; God calls him forth of thoſe fixed habi­tations in
his own Countrey, to ſojourn in Tabernacles, or Booths in a ſtrange land; his
faith carries him cheerfully along; his preſent fruition gives way to hope of
better things: In ſtead of thoſe poor ſheds of ſticks and skins, he looks for
a City; in ſtead of thoſe ſtakes and cords, he looks for Foundations; in ſtead
of mens work, he looks for the Architecture of God. Alaſs, we men will be
build­ing Caſtles, and Towers here upon earth, or, in the ayr rather; ſuch as
either have no foundation at all; or at the beſt, onely a foundation in the
duſt; neither can they [[Page
230]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=114) be any other,
whiles they are of mans making; for what can he make in better condi­tion then
himſelf? The City that is of Gods building is deep, and firmly grounded upon
the rock of his eternal decree; and hath more found­ations then one; and all
of them both ſure and coſtly; Gods material houſe built by Solomon had the
foundation laid with great ſquared ſtone;Revel. 21. 19. but the foundations of
the wall of this City of God are garniſhed with all manner of precious ſtones:
Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou city of God: Why do I ſet up my
reſt in this houſe of clay, which is every day falling on my head, whiles I
have the aſſured expectation of ſo glo­rious [[Page
231]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=114) a dwelling
above?2 Cor. 4. 1. For we know that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle
were diſſolved, we have a building of God; an houſe not made with hands,
eternal in the Heavens.

### 1.79. LXXIX.

God, though he be free of his entertainments, yet is curious of his gueſts: we
know what the great houſe­keeper ſaid to the ſordid gueſt; Friend how cameſt
thou in hither, not having on a wedding garment? To his feaſt of glory none
can come but the pure; without this diſpoſition no man ſhall ſo much as ſee
God,Heb. 12. 14. much leſs be entertained by him: To his feaſt of grace none
may come but the clean, and thoſe [[Page
232]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=115) who upon
ſtrict examination have found themſelves wor­thy: That we may be meet to ſit
at either of theſe Tables, there muſt be a putting off,Coloſ. 3. 9, 10. ere
there can be a putting on; a putting off the old garments, ere there can be a
putting on the new; the old are foul and ragged, the new clean and holy; for
if they ſhould be worn at once; the foul and beaſtly under-garment would ſoyl,
and defile the clean; the clean could not cleanſe the foul: As it was in the
Jewiſh law of holineſs, holy fleſh in the skirt of the garment could not
infuſe an holineſs into the garment;Haggai. 2. 12, 13. but the touch of an
unclean perſon might diffuſe uncleanneſs to the garment: Thus our pro­feſſed
[[Page 233]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=115)
holineſs, and pretended graces are ſure to be defiled by our ſecretly-
maintained corruption, not our corrup­tion ſanctified by our graces; as in
common experience, if the ſound perſon come to ſee the infected; the infected
may eaſily taint the ſound; the ſound cannot by his pre­ſence heal the
infected: If ever therefore we look to be welcome to the feaſts of God, we
muſt put off the old man with his deeds, Coloſ. 3▪ 9, 10. and put on the new
man, which is renewed in knowledg after the image of him that created him.

### 1.80. LXXX.

It is not for us to caſt a diſ­paragement upon any work of our Maker; much
leſs [[Page 234]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=116)
upon a peece ſo neer, ſo eſſen­tial to us: yet with what con­tempt doth the
Apoſtle ſeem ſtill to mention our fleſh? and, as if he would have it ſleighted
for ſome forlorn out-caſt, he charges us, not to make proviſion for the fleſh:
What?Rom. 13. 14. ſhall we think the holy man was faln out with a part of
himſelf? Surely, ſometimes his language that he gives it, is hard: The fleſh
rebels againſt the ſpirit: Rom. 7. 18. I know that in me (that is in my fleſh)
dwelleth no good thing: but how eaſie is it to obſerve, that the Fleſh
ſometimes goes for the body of man; ſome­times for the body of ſin: as the
firſt, it is a partner with the ſoul; as the latter, it is an enemy; and the
worſt of [[Page
235]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=116) enemies,
ſpiritual: No mar­vel then if he would not have proviſion made for ſuch an
enemy: In outward and bo­dily enmity, the caſe, and his charge is
otherwiſe:Prov. 25. 21. If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirſt, Rom.
12. 20. give him drink: but here, make no proviſion for the fleſh: What reaſon
were there that a man ſhould fur­niſh, and ſtrengthen an enemy againſt
himſelf? But if the fleſh be the body of the man, it muſt challenge a reſpect;
but the very name carries an intimation of baſeneſs; at the beſt, it is that
which is com­mon to beaſts with us;1 Cor. 15. 39. There is one fleſh (ſaith
the Apoſtle) of men, another fleſh of beaſts; both are but fleſh: Alas, what
is it but a clod of earth better [[Page
236]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=117) molded, the
clog of the ſoul, a rotten pile, a pack of duſt, a feaſt of worms? But even as
ſuch, proviſion muſt be made for it; with a moderate and thrifty care, not
with a ſolicitous: a proviſion for the neceſſities and convenience of life,
not for the fulfilling of the luſts: This fleſh muſt be fed, and clad; not
humord, not pampered: ſo fed as to hold up nature, not inordi­nateneſs;
ſhortly, ſuch an hand muſt we hold over it, as that we may make it a good
ſervant, not a lawleſs wan­ton.

### 1.81. LXXXI.

What action was ever ſo good, or ſo compleatly done, as to be well taken of
all [[Page 237]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=117)
hands? Noah and Lot fore­tel of judgments from God, upon the old world, and
So­dom, and are ſcoffed at: Iſrael would go to ſacrifice to God in the
wilderneſs, and they are idle; Moſes and Aaron will be governing Iſrael
according to Gods appointment; Ye take too much upon you, ye ſons of Levi:
David will be dancing before the Ark of the Lord;2 Sam. 6. 20. He uncovers
himſelf ſhame­leſly as one of the vain fel­lows:Matt. 11. 18, 19. Our Saviour
is ſocia­ble; He is a wine-bibber, a freind of publicans and ſinners: John
Baptiſt is ſolitary, and auſtere; He hath a devil: Chriſt caſts out devils; He
doth it by Beelzebub the prince of devils: He rides in an homely pomp through
Jeruſalem; he affects a [[Page
238]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=118) temporal
kingdom; and he is no friend to Ceſar that can ſuffer him to live. He is by
his Almighty powr riſen from the dead; his Diſciples ſtole him away, whiles
the Soldiers ſlept: The Spirit of God deſcends upon the Apo­ſtles in fiery and
cloven tongues,Act. 2. 13. and they, thus in­ſpired, ſuddenly ſpeak all
Languages; they are full of new wine. Stephen preach­eth Chriſt the end of the
Law;Act. 6. 11. He ſpeaks blaſphe­mous words againſt Moſes and againſt God;
and what aſ­perſions were caſt upon the primitive Chriſtians, all Hiſtories
witneſs: What can we hope to do, or ſay, that ſhall eſcape the cenſures, and
miſ-interpretations of men, [[Page
239]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=118) when we ſee
the Son of God could not avoyd it? Let a man profeſs himſelf honeſtly
conſcionable, he is a ſcrupu­lous hypocrite; Let him take but a juſt liberty
in things meerly indifferent, he is looſely profane; Let him be charitably
affected to both parts (though in a quarrel not fundamental,) he is an odious
neuter, a luke-warm Laodice­an: It concerns every wiſe Chriſtian to ſettle his
heart in a reſolved confidence of his own holy and juſt grounds, and then to
go on in a con­ſtant courſe of his well-war­ranted judgment, and practiſe,
with a careleſs diſ-regard of thoſe fools-bolts which will be ſure to be ſhot
at him, which way ſoever he goes.

### 1.82. LXXXII.

All Gods dear and faith­ful ones are notably deſcri­bed by the Apoſtle, to be
ſuch as love the appearing of our Lord Jeſus: 2 Tim. 4. 8. for certain­ly, we
cannot be true friends to thoſe whoſe preſence we do not deſire and delight
in; now this appearing is either in his coming to us, or our going to him;
whether ever it be, that he makes his glo­rious return to us for the judg­ment
of the world, and the full redemption of his elect; or, that he fetches us
home to himſelf, for the fruition of his bleſſedneſs; in both, or either, we
enjoy his appear­ance: If then we can onely be content with either of [[Page
241]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=119) theſe; but do
not love them, nor wiſh for them; our hearts are not yet right with God: It is
true that there is ſome terror in the way to both theſe; his return to us is
not without a dreadful Majeſtie;2 Pet. 3. 10. for the Heavens ſhall paſs away
with a great noyſe; and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; and the
glori­ous retinue of his bleſſed An­gels muſt needs be with an aſtoniſhing
magnificence; and on the other part our paſſage to him muſt be through the
gates of death, wherein na­ture cannot but apprehend an horror; but the
immediate iſſue of both theſe is ſo in­finitely advantageous, and happy, that
the fear is eaſily ſwallowed up of the joy; [[Page
242]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=120) Doth the
daughter of Jephtah abate ought of her timbrels and dances becauſe ſhe is to
meet a father,Judg. 11. 34. whoſe armes are bloody with victory? Doth a loving
wife entertain her returning husband other­wiſe then with gladneſs, be­cauſe
he comes home in a military pomp? Is the con­queror leſs joyful to take up his
crown, becauſe it is con­gratulated to him with many peals of Ordnance?
Certainly then, neither that heavenly ſtate wherein Chriſt ſhall re­turn to
us; nor the fears of an harmleſs and beneficial death, wherein we ſhall paſs
to him, either may, nor can hinder ought of our love to his appearing: O
Saviour, come in whatever equipage, [[Page
243]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=120) or faſhion
thou wilt, thou canſt be no other then lovely, and welcome: Come Lord Je­ſus,
come quickly.

### 1.83. LXXXIII.

Suppoſe a man comes to me on the ſame errand which the Prophet delivered to
He­zekiah; 2 Kin. 20. 1. Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye, and not
live: with what welcome do I en­tertain him? Do I, with that good King, turn
my face to the wall, and weep? or do I ſay of the meſſenger as David ſaid of
Ahimaaz; 2 Sam. 18. 27. He is a good man, and brings good tidings? Surely,
Nature urges me to the former, which can­not but hold Diſſolution her greateſt
enemy; for what can ſhe abhor ſo much as a not-being? [[Page
244]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=121) Faith
perſwades me to the latter; telling me that, To dye is gain; Philip. i. 23.
Now, whe­ther of theſe two ſhall prevail with me? Certainly, as each of them
hath a ſhare in me; ſo ſhall either of them act its own part in my ſoul:
Nature ſhall obtain ſo much of me, as to fetch from me, upon the ſuddain
apprehenſion of death, ſome thoughts of fear; Faith ſhall ſtrait ſtep in, and
drive away all thoſe weak fears; and raiſe up my heart to a cheerful
expectation of ſo gainful, and happy a change: Nature ſhews me the gaſtli­neſs
of death; Faith ſhews me the tranſcendency of Hea­venly glory: Nature
repre­ſents to me a rotten carkaſe; Faith preſents me with a glo­rious [[Page
245]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=121) ſoul; Shortly,
nature ſtartles at the ſight of death; Faith out-faces and over­comes it; ſo
then, I who at the firſt bluſh could ſay,Ecclus. 41. 1. O Death how bitter is
thy remem­brance; can now upon my deliberate thoughts, ſay, I deſire to depart
and to be with Chriſt. Philip. 1. 23.

### 1.84. LXXXIIII.

In the carriage of our holy profeſſion, God can neither abide us cowardly, nor
in­diſcreet: The ſame mouth that bad us, when we are per­ſecuted in one city,
flee into another, ſaid alſo; he that will ſave his life, ſhall looſe it; we
may neither cloak cowardice with a pretended diſcretion; nor loſe our
diſ­cretion [[Page
246]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=122) in a raſh
courage; He that is moſt skilful and moſt valiant, may in his combat traverſe
his ground for an ad­vantage; and the ſtouteſt Commander may fall flat to
avoyd a Cannon-ſhot; True Chriſtian wiſdom, and not carnal fear, is that,
wherewith we muſt conſult for advice, when to ſtand to it; and when to give
back. On the one ſide, he dies honorably that falls in Gods quarrel; on the
other, he that flies may fight again; Even our bleſſed lead­er that came
purpoſely to give his life for the world, yet when he found that he was laid
for in Judea, flees into Galilce. The practiſe of ſome Primitive Chriſtians,
that, in an ambition of martyrdom [[Page
247]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=122) went to ſeek
out and chalenge dangers and death, is more worthy of our wonder, and
applauſe, then our imitation. It ſhall be my reſolution to be warily thrifty
in managing my life, when God offers me no juſt cauſe of hazard; and to be
willingly profuſe of my blood, when it is called for by that Saviour, who was
not ſparing of ſhedding his moſt precious blood for me.

### 1.85. LXXXV.

He had need to be well un­der-laid, that knows how to entertain the time and
him­ſelf with his own thoughts: Company, variety of im­ployments, or
recreations, may wear out the day with the emptieſt hearts; but, [[Page
248]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=123) when a man
hath no ſociety but of himſelf, no task to ſet himſelf upon, but what a­riſes
from his own boſome; ſurely, if he have not a good ſtock of former notions, or
an inward mint of new, he ſhall ſoon run out of all, and (as ſome forlorn
bankrupt) grow weary of himſelf: Hereupon it is that men of barren, and
unexerciſed hearts can no more live without company, then fiſh out of the

devotion, have no mental abilities to ſet themſelves on work, are fain to tire
themſelves, and their unwelcome hours, with the perpetual repetitions of the

tedious, and heartleſs formality: Thoſe contemplative ſpirits that are

weariſome to themſelves.

### 1.86. LXXXVI.

There is nothing more eaſie then to be a Chriſtian at large; but the
beginnings of a ſtrict and ſerious Chriſtianity are not without much
difficulty; for nature affects a looſe kinde [[Page
250]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=124) of liberty,
which it cannot indure to have reſtrained: nei­ther fares it otherwiſe with
it, then with ſome wilde colt; which at the firſt taking up, flings and
plunges, and will ſtand on no ground; but af­ter it hath been ſomwhile
diſ­ciplin'd at the Poſt, is grown tractable, and quietly ſub­mits either to
the ſaddle, or the collar: The firſt is the worſt; afterwards that which was
tolerable, will prove eaſie, and that which was eaſie will be found pleaſant:
For in true practi­cal Chriſtianity, there is a more kindly and better
liber­ty;Gal. 5. 1. Standfaſt (ſaith the Apo­ſtle) in that liberty wherewith
Chriſt hath made you free: Lo here a liberty of Chriſts ma­king, [[Page
251]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=124) and therefore
both juſt, and excellent: for what other is this liberty then a free­dome, as
from the tyranny of the law, ſo from the bon­dage of ſin?Rom. 6. 18. Being
then made free from ſin (ſaith Saint Paul) ye became the ſervants of
righte­ouſneſs: Here are two ma­ſters, under one of which eve­ry ſoul muſt
ſerve; either ſin, or righteouſneſs: if we be free from the one, we are bond-
men to the other; we ſay truly, the ſervice of God (that is of righteouſneſs)
is perfect freedom; but to be free to ſin is a perfect bon­dage; and to ſerve
ſin is no other then a vaſſallage to the devil: From this bondage Chriſt onely
can free us;Joh. 8. 36. If the Son ſhall make you free, yee [[Page
252]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=125) ſhall be free
indeed; and we are no Chriſtians, unleſs we be thus freed: and being thus
freed, we ſhall rejoyce in the pleaſant fetters of our volun­tary and
cheereful obedience to righteouſneſs▪ neither would we for a world return to
thoſe gieves and manacles of ſin, which we once beld our moſt dear and comely
ornaments: and can truly ſay, Thou haſt ſet my feet in a large room. Pſal. 31.
8. I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy precepts. Pſal. 119. 45.

### 1.87. LXXXVII.

I cannot but pity and la­ment the condition of thoſe Chriſtians who for the
hope of a little earthly droſs do willingly put themſelves for a continuance
out of the pale [[Page
253]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=125) of Gods
Church: What do they elſe, but caſt themſelves quite out of the Almighties
protection; who hath not bound himſelf to follow them out of his own walks; or
to ſeek them out amongſt Turks and Infidels? well may he ſay to them (as to
the chief Paſtor of Pergamus) I know thy works, Revel. 2. 13. and where thou
dwelleſt; even where Satans ſeat is; but have they any reaſon to expect that
he ſhould dwell with them there, under the raign of that Prince of dark­neſs?
Theſe men put upon themſelves that hard mea­ſure, which the man after Gods own
heart complains to be put upon him by his worſt enemies:Pſal 120. 5. Wo is me
that I am conſtrained to dwell with [[Page
254]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=126) Meſhech, and
to have my habi­tation in the Tents of Kedar: That holy man could in the
bitterneſs of his ſoul inveigh againſt his perſecutors for no other terms then
theſe men offer to themſelves:1 Sam. 26. 19. Curſed be they before the Lord,
for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the
Lord; ſaying, go ſerve other gods: I ſpeak not of thoſe, who carry God along
with them in his ordinance; all earths are alike to us, where we may freely
enjoy his pre­ſence: but of thoſe ſtraglers, who care not to live without God,
ſo they may be befrien­ded by Mammon. How ill a match theſe poor men make for
themſelves, I ſend them to their Saviour to learn [[Page
255]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=126) What is a man
profited if he ſhall gain the whole world; Matt. 16. 26. and loſe his own
ſoul; or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul? God forbid, I ſhould
give their ſouls for loſt, but I muſt ſay, they are hazarded; for herein
doubtleſs, they tempt God, who hath not promiſed to keep them in any other,
then their juſt wayes; and they do in a ſort tempt and challenge Satan, to
draw them on either to a love of error and impiety, or at leaſt to a cooling
of their care and love of truth: How un­like are theſe men to that wiſe
merchant in the Goſpel; He ſold all that he had to buy the pearl of great
price:Matt. 13. 45. 46. they ſell the pearl to buy a little worthleſs
merchandize. As [[Page
256]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=127) the greateſt
part of their tra­fick ſtands upon exchange; ſo I heartily wiſh they would
make this one exchange more; of leſs care of their wealth, for more care of
their ſouls.

### 1.88. LXXXVIII.

Even when Joſeph was a great lord in Egypt, ſecond to none but Pharaoh, and
had the command of that richeſt countrey of the world▪ yet then his old Father
Jacob thought his poor parcel of Shechem worthy to be be­queathed to him, and
embra­ced of him, as a noble patri­mony; becauſe it was in the promiſed land,
and the legacy of a dying Father: How juſt­ly do I admire the faith both
[[Page 257]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=127) of the
father and ſon in this donation! Jacob was now in Goſhen; Shechem was in
Canaan; neither was the father now in the preſent poſſeſſion; nor were the
ſons in ſome ages to enjoy it: It was four hun­dred and thirty years that
Iſrael muſt be a ſojourner in a ſtrange countrey,Exod, 12. 41. ere they ſhall
enter into the promiſed Land; yet now, as foreſeeing the future poſſeſſion,
which his poſterity ſhould take of this ſpot of earth, ſo long af­ter, Jacob
gives Shechem to Joſeph, and Joſeph apprehends it as a rich bleſſing, as the
double portion of the divi­ded primogeniture: Infidelity is purblinde, and can
ſee no­thing but that which is hard at hand; Faith is quick-ſight­ed, [[Page
258]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=128) and diſcerns
the events of many centuries of years, yea of ages to come; A­braham ſaw his
Saviours day, and rejoyced to ſee it, a thouſand nine hundred and fourty years
off; and Adam (before him) almoſt four thouſand years. As to God all things
are preſent, even fu­ture, ſo to thoſe that by a live­ly faith partake of him:
Why do I not by that faith ſee my Saviour returning in his Hea­venly
magnificence, as truly as now I ſee the Heaven whence he ſhall come; and my
body as verily raiſed from the duſt, and become glorious, as now I ſee it weak
and decrepit, and falling into the duſt?

### 1.89. LXXXIX.

True knowledg cauſeth ap­petite and deſire; For the will follows the
underſtanding; whatſoever that apprehends to be good for us, the affective
part inclines to it: No man can have any regard to an un­known good: If an
hungry man did not know that food would refreſh and nouriſh him, or the
thirſty that drink would ſatisfie him, or the naked that fire would warm him,
or the ſick that Phyſick would recover him; none of theſe would affect theſe
ſuc­cors: And according to our apprehenſion of the goodneſs and uſe of theſe
helps, ſo is our appetite towards them: For the object of the will is a [[Page
260]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=129) known good,
either true, or appearing ſo: And if our ex­perience can tell us of ſome that
can ſay, with her in the Poet; I ſee and approve bet­ter things, but follow
the worſe: It is not for that evil, as evil, (much leſs as worſe) can fall
into the will; but, that their appetite over-car­ries them to a miſconceit of
a particular good; ſo as, how­ſoever in a generality, they do confuſedly
aſſent to the goodneſs of ſome holy act, or object, yet upon the preſent
occaſion, (here and now, as the School ſpeaketh) their ſenſi­tive appetite
hath prevailed to draw them to a perſwaſion, that this pleaſure, or that
pro­fit is worthy to be imbraced: Like as our firſt parents had a [[Page
261]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=129) general
apprehenſion that it was good to obey all the commands of their Creator; but
when it came to the for­bidden fruit; now their eye, and their ear, and their
heart tell them, it is good for them, both for pleaſure, and for the gain of
knowledg, to taſte of that forbidden tree: So then, the miſcarriage is not in
that they affect that which they think not to be good; but in that they think
that to be good which is not; for alaſs, for one true good there are many
ſeeming, which delude the ſoul with a fair ſem­blance: As a man in a
gene­rality eſteems ſilver above braſs, but when he meets with a ruſty piece
of ſilver, and a cleer piece of braſs, he [[Page
262]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=130) chooſes rather
the clear braſs then the ſilver defaced with ruſt: Surely, it is our
ignor­ance that is guilty of our cool neglect of our ſpiritual good; if we did
know how ſweet the Lord is, in his ſure promiſes, in his unfailing mercies, we
could not but long after him, and remain unſatisfied till we finde him ours:
would God be pleaſed to ſhine in our hearts by the light of the true knowledg
of himſelf, we could not have cauſe to complain of want of heat in our
affections towards his infinite goodneſs.

Did we but know how ſweet and delectable, Chriſt, the Heavenly Manna, is, we
could not but hunger after him; and we could not [[Page
263]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=130) hunger, and
not be ſatisfied; and, in being ſatisfied, bleſſed.

### 1.90. XC.

Thoſe which we miſ-cal goods, are but in their nature, indifferent, and are
either good or evil as they are affect­ed, as they are uſed: Indeed, all their
malignity, or vertue, is in the minde, in the hand of the poſſeſſor: Riches
ill got ill kept, ill ſpent are but the Mammon of iniquity; but if well,Pro
14. 24. The Crown of the wiſe is their riches: How can it be amiſs to have
much, when he that was the richeſt man of the Eaſt,Job. 1. 1, 3. was the
holieſt? Yea, when God himſelf is juſtly ſtiled the poſſeſſor of Heaven, and
Earth? How [[Page
264]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=131) can it be
amiſs to have little; when our Saviour ſayes: Bleſſed are ye poor: Luke. 6.
20. And if from that divine mouth, we hear a wo to the rich;Luke. 6, 24.
him­ſelf interprets it of them that truſt in riches:Mar. 10. 24. If our riches
poſſeſs us,1 Tim. 6. 17. in ſtead of our poſſeſſing them, we have changed our
God, and loſt our ſelves; but if we have learnt to uſe our wealth, and not
enjoy it, we may be no leſs gracious then rich: If a rich man have a large and
humble heart, and a juſt hand, he inherits the bleſſing of the poor: If a poor
man have a proud heart,Prov. 30. 9. and a theeviſh hand, he carryes a­way the
wo from the rich: Riches (ſaith wiſe Solomon) make themſelves wings, they
[[Page 265]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=131) fly
away as an Eagle towards Heaven; So as we may uſe the matter, our ſouls may
fly thitherward with them; If we do good, and be rich in good works, ready to
diſtribute, willing to communicate, laying up in ſtore for our ſelves a good
foundation againſt the time to come, 1 Tim. 6. 18, 19. that we may lay hold on
eternal life. Let me ſay with Agur, Prov. 38. Give me neither pover­ty, nor
riches; but whetherſo­ever God gives, I am both thankful and indifferent, ſo
as whiles I am rich in eſtate, I may be poor in ſpirit; and whiles I am poor
in eſtate, I may be rich in grace.

Had I been in the ſtreets of Jericho, ſure, me thinks, I [[Page

juſtled with Za­cheus for the Sycomore, to ſee Jeſus; and ſhould have bleſs­ed
my eyes for ſo happy a proſpect: and yet, I conſider that many a one ſaw his
face on earth, which ſhall never ſee his glory in Heaven: and I hear the
Apoſtle ſay, Though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, 2 Cor. 5. 16. yet
now hence­forth know we him ſo no more. O for the eyes of a Stephen, Act. 7.
55, 56. that ſaw the Hea­vens opened, and the glory of God, and Jeſus ſtanding
on the right hand of God! That proſpect did as much tran­ſcend this of
Zacheus, as Heaven is above Earth; cele­ſtial glory above humane in­firmity:
And why ſhould not the eyes of my faith behold [[Page
267]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=132) the ſame
object which was ſeen by Stephens bodily eyes? I ſee thee, O Saviour, I ſee
thee, as certainly, though not ſo clearly: Do thou ſharpen, and fortifie theſe
weak eyes of mine,Pſa.▪ 36. 9. that in thy light I may ſee light.

### 1.92. XCII.

How gracious a word was that which God ſaid to Iſrael, I have called thee by
thy name, Iſa. 43. 1. and thou art mine. He that im­poſed that name upon
Jacob; makes familiar uſe of it to his poſterity: Neither is the caſe
ſingular, but univerſally com­mon to all his ſpiritual iſſue. There is not one
of them, whom he doth not both call by his name, and challenge for his
own:Pſa. 147. 4. He that tells the [[Page
268]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=133) number of the
ſtars, and calls them all by their names; hath alſo a name for every of theſe
earthly luminaries; He who brought all other living creatures unto man, to ſee
how he would call them, and would make uſe of Adams appellation;Gen. 2. 19,
20. reſerved the naming of man to him­ſelf; neither is there any one of his
innumerous poſterity, whom he knowes not by name: But it is one thing to take
notice of their names; another thing to call them by their names; that denotes
his omniſcience; this his ſpecial­ty of favor: none are thus graced but the
true Sons of Iſrael. As Gods children do not content themſelves with a
confuſed knowledg of a [[Page
269]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=133) Deity, but
reſt not till they have attained a diſtinct appre­henſion of their God, as he
hath revealed himſelf to man; ſo doth God again to them: It is not enough that
he knows them in a general view as in the throng, wherein we ſee many faces,
none diſtinct­ly; but he ſingles them out in a familiar kinde of ſeveral­ty
both of knowledg and re­ſpect: As then he hath names for the ſeveral Stars of
Hea­ven,Job 9 9. Cimah, Ceſil, Mazzaroth, &c. Job. 38. 31. And for the ſeveral
An­gels, Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, &c. and calls them by the proper names
which he hath given them; ſo he doth to every of his faithful ones: Of one he
ſaith,Luk. 1. 13. Thou ſhalt call his name John: Joh. 1. 42. Of another, Thou
[[Page 270]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=134) art
Simon, Joh. 1. 42. thou ſhalt be called Cephas: Luke 19. To one he ſays,
Za­cheus, come down; to another, Cornelius, Acts 103, 4. thy prayers, and
thine alms are come up: In ſhort, there is no one of his, whom he doth not
both know, and call by his name. What a comfort is this to a poor wretched man
to think; Here I walk obſcure and contemp­tible upon earth, in a conditi­on
mean, and deſpiſed of men; but the great God of Heaven is pleaſed to take ſuch
notice of me, as even from Heaven to call me by my name; and to ſingle me out
for Grace, and Salvation; and not onely to mention my name from above, in the
gra­cious offer of his Ordinances,Luk. 10. 2 [...]. but to write it in the
eternal [[Page 271]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=134)
Regiſter of Heaven? What care I to be inglorious, yea cauſeleſly infamous with
men, whiles I am thus honor­ed by the King of glory?

### 1.93. XCIII.

It is the great wiſdom and providence of the Almighty, ſo to order the
diſpoſitions and inclinations of men, that they affect divers and different
works, and pleaſures: Some are for manuary trades, others for intellectual
imployments: One is for the Land, another for the Sea; one for hus­bandry,
another for merchan­diſe; one is for Architecture, another for Veſtiary
ſervices; one is for fiſhing, another for paſturage; and in the learn­ed
trades, one is for the [[Page
272]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=135) miſtreſs of
Sciences, Divini­ty; another for the Law, whe­ther Civil, or Municipal; a
third is for the ſearch of the ſecrets of Nature, and the skill and practice
of Phyſick; and each one of theſe di­vides it ſelf into many differ­ing
varieties; Neither is it otherwiſe in matter of plea­ſures; one places his
delight in following his Hawk and Hound, another in the har­mony of Muſick;
one makes his Garden his paradiſe, and enjoys the flouriſhing of his fair
Tulips; another findes contentment in a choice Li­brary; one loves his Bowl,
or his Bowe, another pleaſes himſelf in the patient paſtime of his Angle: For
ſurely, if all men affected one and the [[Page
273]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=135) ſame trade of
life, or pleaſure of recreation, it were not poſ­ſible that they could live
one by another: Neither could there be any uſe of com­merce, whereby mans life
is maintained; neither could it be avoyded, but that the envy of the
inevitable rivality, would cut each others throat. It is good reaſon we ſhould
make a right uſe of this gra­cious and provident diſpen­ſation of the
Almighty; and therefore that we ſhould im­prove our ſeveral diſpoſitions and
faculties to the advancing of the common ſtock; and withal, that we ſhould
nei­ther encroach upon each o­thers profeſſion, nor be apt to cenſure each
others recrea­tion.

He were very quick-ſight­ed that could perceive the growing of the graſs, or
the moving of the ſhadow upon the Dial; yet, when thoſe are done, every eye
doth eaſi­ly diſcern them. It is no otherwiſe in the progreſs of grace; which
how it increa­ſeth in the ſoul, and by what degrees, we cannot hope to
perceive; but being grown, we may ſee it: It is the fault of many Chriſtians,
that they depend too much upon ſenſe; and make that the judg of their
ſpiritual eſtate; being too much dejected when they do not ſenſibly feel the
proofs of their proficiency, and the preſent proceedings [[Page
275]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=136) of their
regeneration: why do they not as well queſtion the growth of their ſtature,
becauſe they do not ſee every day how much they are thri­ven? Surely, it muſt
needs be that ſpiritual things are leſs perceptible then bodily; much more
therefore muſt we in theſe, wait upon time for neceſſary conviction; and well
may it ſuffice us, if upon an impartial comparing of the preſent meaſure of
our know­ledg, faith, obedience with the former, we can perceive our ſelves
any whit ſenſibly advanced.

The wiſe Chriſtian hath learned to value every thing according to its own
worth; [[Page 276]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=137)
If we be too glad of theſe earthly things, it is the way to be too much
afflicted with their loſſe; and whiles we have them, to be tranſported into
pride and wantonneſs; If we eſteeme them too little, it is the way to an
unthankful diſreſpect of the giver. Chriſtianity carries the heart in a juſt
equipoiſe; when they come, they are wel­com'd without too much joy; and when
they go, they part without teares: we may ſmile at theſe earthly favors, not
laugh out; we may like them, but we muſt take heed of being in love with them:
For love, of what kinde ſoe­ver it be, is not without the power of
aſſimilation; If we love the world, we cannot [[Page
277]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=137) but be
worldly-minded:Rom. 8. 5, 6. They that are after the fleſh, do minde the
things of the fleſh; and to be carnally minded is death: Con­trarily if we
love God, we are made partakers of the di­vine nature; and we are ſuch as we
affect: If we be Chriſti­ans in earneſt; certainly the inner rooms of our
hearts, which are the holy of holies, are reſerved for the Almighty; the outer
courts may be for the common reſort of lawful cares and deſires, they may come
and go; but our God ſhall have his fixed habitation here for ever.

Nature is ſlie and cunning; neither is it poſſible to take her without a
ſhift: The light [[Page

her mouth,Prov. 30. 20. and it was not ſhe: Rachel hath ſtoln her fathers
Teraphim, and the cuſtom of women is upon her: Saul reſerves all the fat
cattle of the Amalekites; it is for a ſacrifice to the Lord thy God: Neither
is it ſo onely in excuſing an evil done, but in waving a good to be done: I am
not elo­quent, ſaith Moſes; ſend by him, by whom thou ſhouldſt ſend; Pharaoh
will kill me; there is a lyon in the way, ſaith the Sluggard: I have marryed a
wife, I cannot come, ſaith the ſenſual Gueſt. If I give I ſhall want; If I
make a ſtrict profeſſion, I ſhall be cenſured: Whereas true Grace is on the
one ſide down right, and ingenuous in its [[Page
279]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=138) confeſſions;
not ſparing to take ſhame to it ſelf, that it may give glory to God; on the
other ſide, reſolutely con­ſtant to its holy purpoſes. I and my houſe will
ſerve the Lord: If I periſh, I periſh: I am ready not to be bound onely; but
alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus: It is not hard
therefore for us to know what miſtreſs we ſerve: If our care and endeavor be
by witty evaſions to ſhuffle off both evil and good, we are the vaſ­ſals of
nature; but if we ſhall with an humble penitence ac­knowledg our evil; and ſet
our ſelves with firm reſoluti­ons upon the tasks of good, we are under Grace,
in a way to glory.

It is good for a man not al­ways to keep his eyes at home, but ſometimes to
look abroad at his neighbors; and to compare his own conditi­on with the worſe
eſtate of others: I know I deſerve no more then the meaneſt, no better then
the worſt of men; yet how many do I ſee, and hear to lye groaning upon their
ſick beds, in great ex­tremity of torment, whereas I walk up and down in a
com­petency of health? How many do I ſee ready to famiſh, and forced to either
beg, or ſtarve, whereas I eat my own bread? How many lye rot­ing in Goals and
Dungeons, or are driven to wander in un­known [[Page

amongſt people whoſe language they underſtand not, whereas I enjoy home and
liberty? How many are ſhrieking un­der ſcourges and racks, where­as I ſit at
eaſe? And if I ſhall caſt mine eyes upon my ſpiri­tual condition; alaſs, how
many do I ſee ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death;Mal. 4. 2. whereas
the Sun of Righte­ouſneſs hath ariſen to me with healing in his wings? How
many lye in a woful bondage under ſin and Satan, whereas my Saviour hath freed
me from thoſe helliſh chains, and brought me to the glorious liberty of the
ſons of God? how many are miſerably miſ-led into the dangerous by-paths of
error, whereas he [[Page

graciouſly kept me in the plain and ſure way of his ſa­ving Truth? If we do
not ſometimes make theſe (not proud, but thankful) compa­riſons, and look upon

never be ſenſible enough of our own mercies.

The true Chriſtian is in a very happy condition, for no man will envy him, and
he can envy no body: None will envy him, for the world can­not know how happy
he is; How happy in the favor of a God; how happy in the en­joying of that
Favor: Thoſe ſecret delights that he findes in the preſence of his God; [[Page
283]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=140) thoſe
comfortable pledges of Love, and mutual inter­changes of bleſſed Intereſt
which paſs between them, are not for worldly hearts to con­ceive; and no man
will envy an unknown happineſs. On the other ſide, he cannot envy the worlds
greateſt favorite under Heaven; for he well knows how fickle and uncer­tain
that mans felicity is; he ſees him walking upon Ice, and perceives every foot
of his ſliding, and threatning a fall; and hears that brittle pavement, at
every ſtep, crackling under him, and ready to give way to his ſwal­lowing up:
and withal, findes, if thoſe pleaſures of his could be conſtant and permanent,
how poor and unſatisfying [[Page
284]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=141) they are, and
how utterly un­able to yield true content­ment to the ſoul. The Chriſti­an
therefore, whiles others look upon him with pity and ſcorn, laughs ſecretly to
him­ſelf in his boſom, as well knowing there is none but he, truly happy.

### 1.99. XCIX.

It was an high and honor­able embaſſie, whereon the Angel Gabriel was ſent
down to the bleſſed Virgin; that ſhe ſhould be the Mother of her Saviour:
Neither was that inferior of the glorious Angel that brought the joy­ful
tidings of the incarnation and birth of the Son of God, to the ſhepherds of
Bethle­hem; but a far more happy [[Page
285]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=141) errand was
that which the Lord Jeſus, after his Reſur­rection, committed to the Maries:
Go to my brethren, and ſay to them, Joh. 20. 17. I aſcend to my Father, and
your Father, and to my God, and your God: Lo, he ſays not I am riſen, but I
aſcend; as if he had forgot the Earth, whence he aroſe; and thought onely on
that Heaven whither he was go­ing: Upon his Eaſter, his minde is on his
Aſcenſion day. As there had been no­thing but diſcomfort in death, without a
Reſurrection; ſo there had been little comfort in a Reſurrection, without an
Aſcenſion to glory. There is a contentment in the very act, I aſcend; even
nature is am­bitious; and we do all affect [[Page
286]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=142) to mount
higher; as to come down is a Death; but this height is, like the aſcendent,
infinite, I aſcend to my Father: There was the glory which he put off in his
humble In­carnation; there was the glory which he was now to reſume, and
poſſeſs to all eternity:

And, as if Nature and A­doption could give a like in­tereſt, he puts both
together; My Father, and your Father; my God, and your God: His mercy
vouchſafes to ſtile us Brethren; yet the diſtance is unmeaſureable, betwixt
him, the Son of his eternal Eſſence, and us the naturally-wretched ſons of his
gracious Election; yet, as if both he and we ſhould be coheirs of the ſame
[[Page 287]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=142)
bleſſedneſs (though not in the ſame meaſure) he ſays, My Father, and your
Father: Firſt, my Father, then yours; and indeed therefore ours, becauſe his:
It is in him that we are elected, that we are adopted: Without him, God were
not onely a ſtranger, but an ene­my; It is the Son that muſt make us free; It
is the Son that muſt make us ſons: If we be his, the Father cannot but be
ours.

O the unſpeakable comfort and happineſs of a Chriſtian; In reſpect of his
bodily na­ture, he cannot but ſay (with Job) to the worm, Job 17. 15. Thou art
my mother, and my ſiſter; in his ſpiritual right, God the Son hath here
authorized him to ſay to the Almighty, Thou art [[Page
288]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=143) my Father: And
if nature ſhall, in regard of our frail and dying condition, whiningly ſay, I
deſcend to the grave; Faith makes abundant a­mends in him, and can as
cheerfully ſay, I aſcend to my Father: And what ſon (that is not altogether
graceleſs) would not be glad to go to his father, though it were to a meaner
houſe then his own? and therefore is ready to ſay, I will deſcend to my
Father; How much more, when his many Manſions are infinitely glorious; and
when all our happineſs conſiſts in his bleſs­ed Preſence, muſt we needs ſay,
with a joy unſpeakable, and glorious, I aſcend to my Father?

### 1.100. C.

God made man the lord of his Creatures; he made him not a Tyran; he gave the
Creatures to man for his law­ful uſe, not for his wanton cruelty: Man may
therefore exerciſe his juſt ſoveraignty over the beaſts of the field, and
fowls of the air, and fiſhes of the ſea, not his law­leſs will to their
needleſs de­ſtruction, or torment: Had man made the Creature, he could but
challenge an abſo­lute dominion over that work of his hands; but now that he
is onely a fellow creature to the meaneſt worm, What an inſolent uſurpation is
this, ſo licentiouſly to domineer over his fellow duſt? Yea, [[Page
290]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=144) that great
God, who gave a Being to the creature; and therefore hath a full and
il­limited power over his own workmanſhip, takes no plea­ſure to make uſe of
that power to the unneceſſary vexation, and torture of what he hath made: That
all-wiſe and bountiful Creator, who hath put into the hands of man the
ſubordinate Dominion over all the ſtore of theſe inferior Elements, hath made
the limit of his command, not neceſſity onely, but conveni­ence too; but if
man ſhall go beyond theſe bounds, and will deſtroy the creature one­ly,
becauſe he will, and put it to pain becauſe it is his pleaſure; he abuſeth his
ſo­veraignty to a ſinful imperi­ouſneſs, [[Page
291]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=144) and ſhall be
account­able for his cruelty. When the Apoſtle, upon occaſion of the Law for
not muzzling the mouth of the Ox,1 Cor. 9. 9. asks, Doth God take care for
oxen? Can we think he meant to queſtion the regard that God hath to ſo uſeful
a Creature? Do we not hear the Pſalmist ſay,Pſ. 147. 9. He giveth to the beaſt
his food, and to the young ravens that cry? Do we not hear our Saviour
ſay,Mat. 10. 29. That not a ſpar­row falls to the ground without our heavenly
Father? And of how much more value is an Ox then many thouſands of Sparrows?
Is not the ſpeech therefore, both comparative and typical? Is the main care
that God takes in that Law, for proviſion to be made for [[Page
292]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=145) the beaſt; and
doth he not rather under that figure give order for the maintenance of thoſe
ſpiritual Oxen, that labor in the husbandry of the Almighty? Doubtleſs, as
even the ſavage creatures,Pſal 104. 21, 27, 28. The young lyons ſeek their
meat from God; ſo they finde it from him in due ſeaſon; He open­eth his hand
and filleth every creature with good: Is God ſo careful for preſerving, and
ſhall man be ſo licentious in deſtroying them?Pro. 12. 10. A righ­teous man
(ſaith Solomon) re­gardeth the life of his beaſt, he is no better, therefore,
then a wicked man that regardeth it not: To offer violence to, and to take
away the life from our fellow-creatures, without a cauſe, is no leſs then
tyran­ny: [[Page
293]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=145) Surely, no
other meaſure ſhould a man offer to his beaſt, then that, which if his beaſt
(with Balaams) could expoſtulate with him, he could well juſtifie to it; no
other, then that man, if he had been made a beaſt, would have been content
ſhould have been offered by man to him; no other then he ſhall make account to
anſwer to a common Creator. Juſtly do we ſmile at the niceneſs of the fooliſh
Manichees, who made ſcruple to pull an herb or flower, and were ready to
Preface apologies and excuſes for the reaping of their Corn, and grinding the
grain they fed upon, as if theſe Veget­ables were ſenſible of pain, and
capable of our oppreſſion; [[Page
294]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=146) but ſurely,
for thoſe creatures which enjoying a ſenſitive life, forgo it with no leſs
an­guiſh and reluctation then our ſelves; and would be as willing to live,
without harm, as their owners, they may well challenge both ſuch mercy and
juſtice at our hands, as that in the uſage of them we may approve our ſelves
to their Maker: Where­in I bluſh and grieve to ſee how far we are exceeded by
Turks and Infidels; whom meer nature hath taught more tenderneſs to the poor
brute creatures, then we have learn­ed from the holier rules of charitable
Chriſtianity.

For my part, let me rather affect and applaud the harm­leſs humor of that miſ-
called [[Page 295]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=146)
Saint, who in an indiſcreet humility called every Woolf his brother, and every
Sheep, yea, every Ant his ſiſter, fel­lowing himſelf with every thing that had
life in it, as well as himſelf; then the ty­rannical diſpoſition of thoſe men
who take pleaſure in the abuſe, perſecution, deſtructi­on of their fellow-
creatures, upon no other quarrel, then becauſe they live.

## 2\. Supernumeraries.

### 2.1. I.

THere is a ſatiety in all other (even the beſt) things that I either have, or
doe: I can be eaſily apt to complain of being wearied, or cloyed with the ſame
objects but in the thoughts of ſpiritual things, mee thinkes, I can never have
enough: For as there is infinite ſcope and variety of matter, wherein to
employ my meditations, ſo in each one of them, there is ſuch marvellous depth,
that I ſhould in vaine hope, after all [[Page
297]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=147) my exquiſiteſt
ſearch, to reach unto the bottome: Yea the more I look upon the
in­comprehenſible Deity, in any one of his glorious attributes, or any one of
his omnipotent works, of creation, govern­ment, redemption; the more I long to
ſee, and the leſs am I ſatisfied in ſeeing: and now I finde cauſe to bleſs
that un­ſpeakable goodneſs, that he hath vouchſafed to give leave to his
unworthy creaturs, to contemplate thoſe excellent glories, and thoſe ſaving
myſteries; and think my ſelf happy in ſo gracious a liberty of exchanging
theſe worth­leſs thoughts of the world, for the deare and precious meditations
of heavenly things; and now how juſtly [[Page
298]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=148) do I fall out
with my wretch­ed ſelf, that I have given way to ſecular diſtractions? ſince
my heart can be ſometimes in Heaven, why ſhould it not be alwaies there?

### 2.2. II.

What is this that I ſee? my Saviour in an Agonie, and an Angel ſtrengthening
him? Oh the wonderful diſpenſati­on of the Almighty! That the eternal Son of
God, who promiſed to ſend the comfor­ter to his followers, ſhould need
comfort! That he, of whom the voice from Hea­ven ſaid, This is my well-
belo­ved Son in whom I am well plea­ſed, ſhould be ſtrugling with his Fathers
wrath even to blood! That the Lord of [[Page
299]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=148) life ſhould in
a languiſhing horror, ſay, My ſoul is ex­ceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death!
Theſe, theſe, O Sa­viour, are the chaſtiſements of our peace, which both thou
wouldſt ſuffer, and thy Father would inflict; The leaſt touch of one of thoſe
pangs, would have been no leſs then an hell to mee; the whole brunt whereof
thou enduredſt for my ſoul; what a wretch am I, to grudg a little paine from,
or for thee who wert content to under­goe ſuch preſſure of torment for me, as
ſqueezed from thee a ſweat of blood! ſince my miſerable ſinfulneſs de­ſerved
more load, then thou in thy merciful compaſſion wilt lay upon mee; and thy
[[Page 300]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=149) pure
nature, and perfect inno­cence merited nothing but love and glory.

In this ſad caſe, what ſer­vice is it that an Angel offers to do unto
thee?Luc. 22. 43. [Lo there appeares to thee an Angel from Heaven,
ſtrengthening thee] ſtill more wonder! Art not thou the God of ſpirits? Is it
not thou, that gaveſt be­ing, life, motion, power, glory to all the Angels of
Heaven? Shall there be need of one ſingle created ſpirit to adminiſter
ſtrength and com­fort to his Creator? were this the errand; why did not all
that bleſſed Chore of celeſtial ſpirits joyn their forces toge­ther in ſo high
an imploy­ment? Where are the multi­tudes of that heavenly hoſt, [[Page
301]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=149) which at thy
birth,Luk. 2. 13. 14. ſung, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on earth peace?
Where are thoſe Angels which miniſtred to thee after thy combat of temptations
in the wilder­neſs? Surely there was not ſo much uſe of their divine
cor­dialls in the deſart, as in the garden; O my God, and Sa­viour, thus thou
wouldſt have it; It is thy holy will that is the rule and reaſon of all thine
actions, and events; Thou that wouldſt make uſe of the proviſion of men for
thy maintenance on earth, wouldſt employ thy ſervants the Angels, for the
ſupply of thy conſolations; and thou that couldſt have comman­ded Legions of
thoſe celeſtial ſpirits, wouldſt be ſerved by [[Page
302]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=150) one; not, but
that more were preſent, but that onely one appeared; all the hoſt of them ever
inviſibly attended thee, as God, but as man, one onely preſents himſelf to thy
bodily eyes; and thou, who madeſt thy ſelf,Heb. 2. 9. for our ſakes, a little
lower then the Angels which thou madeſt, wouldſt humble thy ſelf to receive
comfort from thoſe hands, to which thou gaveſt the capacity to bring it; It is
no marvel if that which was thy condeſcent, be our glory and happineſs: I am
not wor­thy, O God, to know what conflicts thou haſt ordained for my weakneſs;
what ever they be, thou that haſt ap­pointed thine Angels to be miniſtring
ſpirits for the [[Page
303]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=150) behoof of them
who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation, Heb. 1. 14. ſuffer not thy ſervant to want
the pre­ſence of thoſe bleſſed Emiſſa­ries of thine in any of his
ex­tremities; let them ſtand by his ſoul in his laſt agonie, and after an
happy Eluctation conveigh it to thy glory.

### 2.3. III.

Many a one hath ſtumbled dangerouſly at a wicked mans proſperity; and ſome
have fallen deſperately into that ſin, which they have ſeen thrive in others
hands: Thoſe car­nal hearts know no other proof of good or evil but pre­ſent
events; eſteeming thoſe cauſes holy and juſt which are crowned with outward
ſuc­ceſs: not conſidering that it [[Page
304]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=151) is one of the
cunningeſt plots of hell, to win credit to bad enterpriſes by the faireſt
iſſues; wherein, the Devill deales with unwary men, like ſome cheating
gameſter, who having drawn in an unskilful and wealthy novice into play,
ſuffers him to win a while at the firſt, that he may at the laſt, ſweet away
all the ſtakes, and ſome rich mannors to boote: The fooliſh Benjami­nites
having twice won the field, begin to pleaſe them­ſelves with a fale conceit of
Gibeahs honeſty,Judg. 20. and their own perpetual victories; but they ſhall
ſoon finde that this good ſpeed is but a pit-fal to entrap them in an enſuing
de­ſtruction. It is a great judg­ment of God to puniſh [[Page
305]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=151) ſinners with
welfare; and to render their leud waies pro­ſperuos: wherein, how contra­ry
are the Almighties thoughts to theirs; their ſee­ming bleſſings are his heavy
curſe; and the ſmart of his ſtripes are a favor too good for them to enjoy, to
judge wiſe­ly of our condition, it is to be conſidered not ſo much how we
fare, as upon what termes: If we ſtand right with Heaven, every croſs is a
bleſſing, and every bleſſing a pledge of future happineſs: if we be in Gods
disfavor, eve­ry of his benefits is a judg­ment; and every judgment makes way
for perdition: For mee, let it be my care that my diſpoſition may be holy, and
my actions righteous, let [[Page
306]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=152) God undertake
for the event.

### 2.4. IV

It is no eaſie thing to per­ſwade a man that he is proud; every one profeſſes
to hate that vice, yet cheriſhes it ſe­cretly in his boſome: for what is pride
but an over-weening of our ſelves? and ſuch is is our natural ſelf-love, that
we can hardly be drawn to believe that in any kinde we think too well of our
own: Now, this pride is ever ſo much more dangerous, as the thing which we
over-prize is more excellent; and as our miſ-apprehenſion of it m [...]y be
more diffuſive: To be proud of gay-cloathes, which is childiſh; or, to be
proud of [[Page
307]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=152) beauty, which
is a woman­iſh vice, hath in it more fond­neſs then malignity; and goes no
further then the breſt wherein it is conceived; finding no other
entertain­ment in the beholders, then either ſmiles, or envy: but the pride of
knowledg, or holy diſpoſitions of the ſoul, as it is of an higher na­ture, ſo
it produceth com­monly more perilous effects: for as it puffes up a man above
meaſure; ſo it ſuffers not it ſelf to bekept in within the narrow bounds of
his own thoughts, but violently burſts out to the extream prejudice of a world
of men:Prov. 13. 10. Onely by pride commeth contention, ſaith wiſe Solomon:
Even purſe­pride is quarelous, domineer­ing [[Page
308]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=153) over the
humble neigh­bourhood, and raiſing quar­rels out of trifles; but the
ſpi­ritual arrogance is ſo much more miſcheivous, as the ſoul is beyond all
earthly pelf: For, when we are once come to advance, and admire our own
judgments; we are firſt apt to hug our own in­ventions; then to eſteem them
too precious to be ſmo­thered within our own clo­ſets: the world muſt know of
how happy an iſſue we are delivered; and muſt applaud it, or abide a
conteſtation, and expect a challenge. The faireſt paradoxes cannot paſs
without a contradiction; it were ſtrange if ſome as bold, and forward wits as
our own, ſhould not take up the gant­let: [[Page
309]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=153) now the fray
is begun; the multitude is divided; ſides are taken; the world is in an
uproare, from skirmiſh­es we grow to pitcht fields: the Church bleeds on both
parts; and it were marvel if kingdoms could be free:

But that which moſt not­ably evinceth the deceitful­neſs of mans heart in this
be­half, is, that this pride is too often lodged in thoſe breſts which are
profeſſedly devot­ed to a godly and mortified lowlineſs: for, as for thoſe
perſons which are meer fleſh, they are careleſly indifferent to error or
truth; neither are at all moved with the ſucceſs of either; but the religious
minde, when it is once poſ­ſeſſed with the conceit of [[Page
310]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=154) ſome ſingular
and important truth revealed to it, and hid from the reſt of the world, is
ready to ſay with the Samari­tan Lepers;2 King. 7. 9. I do not well; this day
is a day of good tidings, and I hold my peace; and therefore makes it matter
of conſcience to trouble the Church with a miſ-grounded novelty: Come we to
the Teſt; Let me ask theſe miſ-guided ſouls that are no leſs confidently
per­ſwaded of their own humility then Truth; Can it be any other then an
height of pride, for a man to think himſelf wiſer then the whole Church of God
upon earth? wiſer then the whole Church of God that hath been upon earth ever
ſince the Apoſtles of Chriſt incluſively, in all [[Page
311]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=154) ſucceſſions to
this preſent time? Can they without much pride think they can look deeper into
the great myſteries of Godlineſs, then thoſe bleſſed attendants of our
Saviour, and their graci­ous ſucceſſors, the holy mar­tyrs, the godly and
religious guides of Gods Church, in all the following ages? Had not they,
then, the ſame God; the ſame Scriptures, the illu­minations of the ſame
Spirit? Can they imagine it leſs then inſolent to attribute more to their own
private opinion, then to the conſtant judg­ment and practiſe of the whole
Chriſtian world in all ſucceſſions of Generations? Can they ſuppoſe themſelves
in their ſingle capacity [[Page
312]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=155) (though
neither Prophets, nor Prophets ſons) meet Judges or Queſtioniſts of thoſe
matters of Faith which the general Councils of the purer times have
unanimouſ­ly agreed upon as the main principles of Chriſtianity? can they
think themſelves priviledged by the liberty of propheſying to coyn new
articles, to deface old? Surely, if the hand of pride be not in all this, I
ſhall never deſire to be acquainted with humility; ſo as it is too plain, that
a man may be exceeding proudly and not know it; this vicious habit lurks cloſe
in the ſoul, and un­leſs it diſcover it ſelf by ſome ſcarce—diſcernable
effects (which break out now and [[Page
313]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=155) then,
eſpecially, upon occa­ſions of oppoſition) is rather more concealed from the
owner, then from the eyes of a ſtranger: But (if ever,) it bewrays it ſelf in
the affectati­on of undue eminence, ſcorn­ful under-valuation of others
merits, obſtinacy in opinion, ſharpneſs of cenſures, and im­patience of
contradiction; Of all theſe the world is com­monly no leſs guilty, then all
theſe are guilty of the com­mon miſeries.

Lord deliver us from our pride, and our contentions will dye alone.

### 2.5. V

What a ſtrange praiſe and priviledge is that which is given to Enoch, above
all [[Page 314]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=156)
thoſe generations of men that peopled the firſt world; of whom the Spirit of
God ſaies;Gen. 5. 24. Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him:
Doubtleſs, amongſt all thoſe ſucceſſive families of the ſons of Seth, there
were many religious and well-affected ſouls; yet there was no one of them that
had this character ſet upon him, that he walked with God, but he: Whether it
were, that God did in a more open and entire way reveal himſelf to that
exemplary Saint; or whether that holy man did in a more cloſe and familiar
faſhion, converſe with the inviſible Deity, the preſence was cer­tain, and the
acknowledg­ment mutual: neither was [[Page
315]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=156) this walk
ſhort, for a turn, and away; but conſtant, and continual; even for the ſpace
of three hundred years:Gen. 5. 22. And what? did the bleſſed man re­tire to
ſome deſart, far from all humane ſociety, that he might enjoy this heavenly
company alone? Did he this-while caſt off all ſecular thoughts, and abdicate
all the care of his family? Nei­ther this, nor that; for in this ſpace wherein
he walked with his God; he both begat ſons and daughters, and bred them like
the children of ſuch a father; as one that knew to make the world ſubordinate,
not oppoſite to it's maker: and had learn'd to reconcile the uſe of the
creature with the fruition of the Creator: [[Page
316]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=157) What then were
the ſteps of this walk, but pious thoughts, heavenly affections, fervent love,
reverential fear, ſpiritu­al joy, holy deſires, divine raviſhments of ſpirit;
ſtrict obediences, aſſiduous devo­tions, faithful affiances, gra­cious
ingagements, firme re­ſolutions, and effectual indea­vors of good, and
whatſoe­ver might work a dearneſs of reſpect betwixt the ſoul, and the God of
Spirits: O God, that which thou pro­miſedſt (as a reward) to thoſe few Saints
of Sardis, Revel. 3. 4. that had not defile their garments, thou haſt before
hand fully performed to this eminent worthy of the firſt world; he walked with
thee in white, in the white of innocence [[Page
317]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=157) here; and in
the ſhining robes of glory above; ſo thou haſt told us, He was not, for God
took him; Lo; being, and good were wont to paſs for convertible; but here,
Enochs not-being, is his bleſſedneſs; he was not at all here; that he might be
perfectly above: The beſt being on earth is but miſerable; even Enochs walk
with God cannot exempt him from ſorrows; he muſt ceaſe to be, that he may
begin to be happy; He was then hap­py, not for that he was not; (a meer
privation of being can be no other then the worſt of evils) but for that God
took him: The God with whom he walkt ſo long upon earth, takes him away from
the earth to himſelf, for eter­nity: [[Page
318]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=158) Here below
though he walk't with God, yet with­all he converſed with ſinful men, whoſe
wickedneſs could not but many a time vex his righteous ſoul; now he is freed
from all thoſe ſpi­ritual annoyances; enjoying onely the glorious preſence and
viſion of the Divine majeſty, the bleſſed Angels, and the Saints, co-partners
of the ſame immortality. There can be no doubt but that the ſouls of his holy
predeceſſors Adam, Abel, Seth, returned to the God that gave them; but had not
Enoch been bleſſ­ed with a peculiar conveiance to his glory, it had not been
ſaid, That God took him: were onely the ſpirit of Enoch yeild­ed up in the way
of an ordi­nary [[Page
319]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=158) death, the man
had not been taken; now, whole Enoch, body and ſoul, is tranſ­lated to an
heavenly life.

His father Jared, Ecculs. 44. 16. and his ſon Methuſelah went to God in the
common way of men, by a ſeparation of the ſpirit from the fleſh; but for him,
God took him; and cloathed him living with immortality: I finde none but him
and Elijah that were thus fetcht to their Heaven: It will be happy for us if
we may paſs in the common road to bleſſedneſs; O God, give me to walk cloſe
and conſtantly with thee, and what end thou pleaſeſt; let my body paſs through
all the degrees of corruption, ſo that my ſoul may be immediately glorious.

FINIS.

BLeſſed Lord God; thou calleſt me to obedience; and fain would I fol­low thee:
but what good can this wretched heart of mine be capable of, except thou put
it there? thou know'ſt I cannot ſo much as [[Page
2]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=160) wiſh to think
well without thee; I have ſtrong powers to offend thee; my ſins are my own;
but whence ſhould I have any inclination to good but from thee, who art only,
and all good? Lord, work me to what thou requireſt, and then require what thou
wilt.

### 3.2. II.

Lord God, whither need I go to ſeek thee? Thou art ſo with me, as that I
cannot move but in thee. I look up to heaven; there I know thy Majeſtie moſt
manifeſts it ſelf; but withall, I know that being here thou art never out of
thy heaven, for it is thy preſence onely that makes heaven: Oh give me to
en­joy [[Page 3]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=160)
thee in this loweſt region of thine heavenly habitation; and as in reſpect of
my natu­rall being, I live and move in thee, ſo let me not live and move
ſpiritually, but with thee, and to thee.

### 3.3. III.

Whither now, O whither do ye rove O my thoughts? Can ye hope to finde reſt in
any of theſe ſublunary con­tentments, Alas? how can they yeeld any ſtay to
you, that have no ſettlement in themſelves? Is there not e­nough in the
infinite good to take you up; but that ye will be wandring after earthly
va­nities? Oh my Lord, how juſtly mighteſt thou caſt me off with ſcorn, for
caſting any [[Page
4]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=161) affective
glances upon ſo baſe a rival? Truly Lord, I am aſhamed of this my hatefull
inconſtancy; but it is thou only that muſt remedy it; O thou that art the
father of mercies pity my wildneſſe, and weak diſtractions: Take thou my heart
to thee, it is thine own; keep it with thee, tye it cloſe to thee by the cords
of love, that it may not ſo much as caſt down an eye upon this wretched and
per­iſhing world.

### 3.4. IIII.

Lord, I confeſſe to my ſhame, thou art a great loſer by me; for, beſides my
not improving of thy favors, I have not kept even-reckon­ings with thee; I
have not [[Page 5]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=161)
juſtly tallied up thy ineſti­mable benefits: Thy very privative mercies are
both without, and beyond my ac­count; for every evill that I am free from, is
a new bleſſing from thee; That I am out of bondage, that I am out of pain and
miſery, that I am out of the dominion of ſin; out of the tyranny of Satan, out
of the agonies of an af­flicted ſoul; out of the tor­ments of hell: Lord, how
unſpeakeable mercies are theſe? Yet, when did I bleſs thee for any of them?
Thy poſitive bounties I can feel, but with a benummed and imperfect ſence.
Lord, do thou enlarge, and intenerate my heart; make me truly ſen­ſible, as of
my good received; [[Page
6]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=162) ſo of my eſcaped
evils; and take thou to thy ſelf the glory of them both.

### 3.5. V.

Ah my Lord God, what heats and colds do I feel in my ſoul? Sometimes I finde
my ſelf ſo vigorous in grace, that no thought of doubt dare ſhew it ſelf; and
me thinks I durſt challenge my helliſh enemies; another while I feel my ſelf
ſo dejected and heart­leſſe, as if I had no intereſt in the God of my
ſalvation, nor never had received any cer­tain pledges of his favour: What
ſhall I ſay to this va­rious diſpoſition? Whether, Lord, is it my
wretchedneſſe to ſuffer my ſelf to be rob'd of thee, for the time, by
temp­tation? [[Page
7]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=162) or whether is
this the courſe of thy proceedings in the diſpenſation of thy graces to the
ſons of men; that thou wilt have the breathings of thy Spirit, as where, ſo
how, and when thou pleaſeſt? Surely, O my God, if I did not know thee conſtant
to thine everlaſting mercies, I ſhould be utterly diſhearten­ed with theſe ſad
intervals; now, when my ſenſe failes me, I make uſe of my faith; and am no
leſſe ſure of thee, even when I feel thee not, then when I finde the cleareſt
evidences of thy gracious pre­ſence. Lord, ſhine upon me with the light of thy
counte­nance (if it may be) alwaies; but, when ever that is clou­ded,
ſtrengthen thou my [[Page
8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=163) faith; ſo ſhall
I be ſafe, even when I am comfortleſs.

### 3.6. VI.

O my God, I am juſtly aſhamed to think what favors I have received from thee,
and what poor returns I have made to thee: Truly Lord, I muſt needs ſay, thou
haſt thought nothing either in earth, or in heaven too good for me; and I, on
the other ſide, have grudg'd thee that weak and worthleſs obedi­ence which
thou haſt requi­red of me: Alas, what plea­ſure could I have done to thee who
art infinite, if I had ſa­crificed my whole ſelf to thee, as thou commandeſt?
Thou art, and wilt be thy ſelf, though the world were not; [[Page
9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=163) it is I, I only
that could be a gainer by this happy match; which in my own wrong I have
unthankfully neglected; I ſee it is not ſo much what we have, as how we imploy
it: O thou, that haſt been ſo bountiful, in heaping thy rich mercies upon me,
vouchſafe to grant me yet one gift more; give me grace and power to improve
all thy gifts to the glory of the giver; otherwiſe, it had been better for me
to have been poor, then ingrate­ful.

### 3.7. VII.

Ah Lord, What ſtrugling have I with my weak fears? how do I anticipate my
evils by diſtruſt? What ſhall I do when I am old? How [[Page
10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=164) ſhall I be able
to indure pain? How ſhall I paſs through the horrid gates of death? Oh my God,
Where is my faith that I am thus ſurprized? Had I not thee to up-hold, and
ſtrengthen my ſoul, well might I tremble and ſink un­der theſe cares; but now,
that I have the aſſurance of ſo ſtrong an helper, as com­mands all the powers
of hea­ven, earth, and hell, what a ſhame is it for me to give ſo much way to
my wretched infidelity, as to puniſh my ſelf with the expectation of future
evils? Oh for the victorie that overcomes the world,1 Joh. 5. 4. even our
faith; Thou O God, Pſal. 46. 1. 2. art my refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent
help in trouble; therefore will I not [[Page
11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=164) fear though the
earth be remo­ved, and though the moun­tains be carried into the midſt of the
Sea.

### 3.8. VIII.

Lord, I made account my daies ſhould have been but an inch; but thou haſt made
them a ſpan long; Pſal. 39. 6. having drawn out the length of a cra­zie life
beyond the period of my hopes: It is for ſome­thing, ſure, that thou haſt thus
long reſpited me from my grave, which look't for me many years ago: Here I am,
O my God, attending thy good pleaſure; Thou know'ſt beſt what thou haſt to do
with me; Diſpoſe of me as thou wilt; Only make me faithfull in all thy
ſervi­ces; [[Page
12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=165) reſolute to
truſt my ſelf with thee in all events; care­full to be approved of thee in all
my waies; and crown my decayed age with ſuch fruits as may be pleaſing to
thee, and available to the good of many; Laſtly, let me live to thee, and die
in thee.

### 3.9. IX.

How oft, Lord, have I wondred to ſee the ſtrange carriage of thine
adminiſtra­tion of theſe earthly affaires; and therein to ſee thy marvai­lous
wiſdome, power, good­neſs, in fetching good out of evill! Alas, we wretched
men are apt enough to fetch the worſt of evils, out of the greateſt good,Jude
4. turning the grace of thee our God into wan­tonneſſe: [[Page
13]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=165) but how have I
ſeen thee, of liveleſs ſtones to raiſe up children to Abraham, of ſinners to
make Saints? out of a deſperate confuſion to fetch order; out of a bloudy war,
an happy peace; out of reſolutions of revenge, love; out of the rock, water;
out of a perſecuter, an Apoſtle? How can I be diſcouraged with unlikelihoods,
when I ſee thee work by contraries? It is not for me, O my God, to examine or
pre-judge thy counſailes; take what waies thou wilt, ſo thou bring me to thine
own end; all paths ſhall be direct that ſhall leade me to bleſſedneſs.

### 3.10. X.

How many good purpoſes, [[Page
14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=166) O my God, have
I taken up, & let fall to the ground again without effect? how teeming hath
this barren womb of my heart been of falſe concepti­ons? but eſpecially, when
thy hand hath been ſmart and heavy upon me in mine af­fliction, how have I
tasked my ſelf with duties, and re­vived my firme reſolutions of more ſtrict
obedience, which yet upon the continuance of my better condition, I have
ſlackened? Lord, it is from thee that I purpoſed well; it is from my own
ſinfull weak­neſs that I failed in my per­formances; If any good come me, the
will and the deed muſt be both thine;Prov. 16. 1. The very pre­parations of
the heart are from thee;Prov. 16. 9. and if I have deviſed [[Page
15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=166) my way, it muſt
be thou that directeſt my ſteps: O God, do thou ripen and perfect all the good
motions that thou putteſt into my ſoul; and make my health but ſuch as my
ſickneſs promiſed.

### 3.11. XI.

Every man, Lord, is un­willing that his name ſhould dye; we are all naturally
ambi­tious of being thought on when we are gone; thoſe that have not living
monuments to perpetuate them, affect to have dead; if Abſolon have not a ſon,
he will yet erect a pillar: yet when we have all done, time eates us out at
the laſt;Eccleſ 2. 16. There is no remembrance of the wiſe more then of the
foole for ever; ſeeing that which now [[Page
16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=167) is, in the
daies to come ſhall all be forgotten. O God, let it be my care and ambition,
what ever become of my memory here below, that my name may be recorded in
Heaven.

### 3.12. XII.

Thy wiſe providence, O God, hath ſo ordered it, that every mans minde ſeeks
and findes contentment in ſome thing; otherwiſe it could not be (ſince we muſt
meet with ſo frequent croſſes in the world) but that mans life would be
burdenſome to him; one takes pleaſure in his hauke or hound; another in his
horſes and furnitures; one in fair buildings; another in pleaſant walks and
beautiful gardens; one in travailing [[Page
17]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=167) abroad; another
in the en­ioying of the profits and plea­ſures of his home; one in the
increaſe of his wealth; another in the titles of his honor; one in a
comfortable wife, another in loving and dutiful children, but when all is
done, if there be not ſom­what els to uphold the heart in the evil day, it
muſt ſink. O God, do thou poſſeſſe my ſoul of thee; let me place all my
felicity in the fruition of thine infinite goodneſs; ſo I am ſure the worſt of
the world hath not power to ren­der me other then happy.

### 3.13. XIII.

O Lord God, under how oppoſite aſpects do I ſtand, from the world? how
vari­ouſly [[Page
18]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=168) am I conſtrued
by men? One pities my condition, ano­ther praiſes my patience; One favors mee
out of the opinion of ſome good that he thinks he ſees in mee; another
diſlikes me for ſome imagined evil: What are the eyes, or tongues of men to
mee? Let me not know what they ſay, or think of me, and what am I the better
or worſe for them? they can have no influence upon me without my own
apprehenſion: All is in what termes I ſtand with thee, my God; if thou be
pleaſed to look upon me with the eye of thy tender mercy and com­paſſion, What
care I to be unjuſtly brow-beaten of the world? If I may be bleſſed with thy
favour, let me be [[Page
19]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=168) made a gazing-
ſtock to the world, to Angels, and to men.

### 3.14. XIV.

Speak Lord, for thy ſer­vant heareth: What is it which thou wouldſt have me do
that I may finde reſt to my ſoul? I am willing to exer­ciſe my ſelf in all the
acts of piety which thou requireſt; I am ready to faſt, to pray, to read, to
hear, to meditate, to communicate, to give alms, to exhort, admoniſh, reprove,
comfort where thou bid'ſt me; and if there be any other duty appertaining to
devoti­on, or mercy, let me ſerve thee in it: But, alas, O my God, howſoever I
know theſe works are in themſelves well-pleaſing [[Page
20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=169) unto thee, yet
as they fall from my wretchedneſs, they are ſtained with ſo many
imperfections, that I have more reaſon to crave pardon for them, then to put
confi­dence in them; and if I could performe them never ſo ex­quiſitely, yet
one ſin is more then enough to daſh all my o­bedience. I ſee then, O Lord, I
well ſee there is no act that I can be capable to do unto thee, wherein I can
finde any repoſe; it muſt be thine act to me, which only can effect it; It is
thy gracious word,Matth. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye that labour, and are
heavy laden, and I will give you reſt; Lo this reſt muſt be thy gift, not my
earning; and what can be freer then gift? Thou giveſt it then, but to [[Page
21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=169) thoſe that come
to thee; not to thoſe that come not; To thoſe that come to thee laden and
labouring under the ſenſe of their own wretchedneſs; not to the proud, and
care­leſs; O Saviour, thy ſinner is ſufficiently laden with the burden of his
iniquities; lade thou me yet more with true penitent ſorrow for my ſins; and
inable me then to come unto thee by a lively faith; Take thou the praiſe of
thine own work; Give me the grace to come; and give me reſt in coming.

### 3.15. XV.

O bleſſed Saviour, What ſtrange variety of conceits do I finde concerning thy
thou­ſand years raign? What [[Page
22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=170) riddles are in
that propheſie; which no humane tongue can aread? where to fix the begin­ing
of that marvailous millen­ary, and where the end; and what manner of raign it
ſhall be, whether temporal, or ſpi­ritual; on earth, or in heaven; undergoes
as many conſtru­ctions, as there are pens that have undertaken it; and yet
(when all is done) I ſee thine Apoſtle ſpeaks onely of the ſouls of thy
martyrs, raigning ſo long with thee; not of thy raigning on earth ſo long with
thoſe Martyrs; How buſie are the tongues of men, how are their brains taken up
with the indeterminable conſtru­ction of this enigmaticall truth? when, in the
mean time, the care of thy ſpirituall [[Page
23]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=170) raign in their
hearts, is neg­lected; O my Saviour, whiles others weary themſelves with the
diſquiſition of thy perſo­nall raign here upon earth for a thouſand years; let
it be the whole bent and ſtudy of my ſoul, to make ſure of my per­ſonall raign
with thee in hea­ven to all eternity.

### 3.16. XVI.

Bleſſed be thy name, O God, who haſt made a good uſe even of hell it ſelf; How
many Atheous hearts have been convinced by the very operations of Devils?
Thoſe which would with the ſtupid Saducees, perſwade themſelves there are no
ſpirits; yet when they have ſenſibly found the marvellous effects wrought
[[Page 24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=171) even by
the baſe inſtruments of Satan; they have been forced to confeſſe, Doubt­leſs
there is a God that rules the world; for ſo great pow­ers of evill ſpirits
muſt neceſ­ſarily evince the greater pow­ers of good; It is of thy wiſe and
holy diſpenſation that thy good Angels do not ſo fre­quently exhibite
themſelves, and give ſo viſible demon­ſtrations of their preſence to thy
Saints, as the evill Angels do to their Vaſſals, though they are ever as
preſent, and more powerfull; What need they; when thou ſo mightily over-ruleſt
thoſe malignant ſpirits, that thou forceſt from them thine own glory, and
advantage to thy choſen? Lord, how much more ſhall [[Page
25]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=171) all thy other
creatures ſerve to thy praiſe, when thy very helliſh enemies ſhall proclaim
thy juſtice, goodneſs, omni­potence.

### 3.17. XVII.

Speculation, O Lord, is not more eaſie then practice is difficult; how many
have we known, who, as it was ſaid of the Philoſophers of old, know how to
ſpeak well, but live ill; How many have written books of Chymiſtry, and given
very confident di­rections for the finding out of that precious ſtone of the
Phi­loſophers, but how many have indeed made gold? Practice is that which
thou, O God, chiefly requireſt and reſpecteſt; who haſt ſaid, [[Page
26]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=172) If ye know
theſe things, bleſſed are ye if you do them; Knowledg puffeth up, 1 Cor. 8. 1.
but love edifieth: O Lord do thou enlighten mine eyes with the knowledg of thy
will; but above all, do thou rectifie my affections, guide my feet into the
wayes of thy commandements; Pſal. 119. 112. ap­ply my heart to fulfill thy
ſta­tutes alway;Pſal 90. 17. and Proſper thou the work of my hands upon me, O
proſper thou my handi-work.

### 3.18. XVIII.

How oft have I wondred, O Lord, at the boldneſs of thoſe men, who knowing they
muſt ſhortly die, yet dare do thoſe things which will draw upon them eternity
of torments? What ſhall I [[Page
27]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=172) ſay, but, The
fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God; Sure­ly, men love themſelves
well enough; and would be loth to do that, which would pro­cure them an
inevitable miſe­ry and pain; Did they there­fore believe there were ano­ther
world, and that they muſt be called to a ſtrict rec­koning for all their
actions, and be doomed to an everlaſt­ing death for their wicked deeds, they
durſt not, they could not do thoſe acts which ſhould make them eternally
miſerable: Let me ſay to the moſt deſperate ruffian; there is poyſon in this
cup, drink this draught and thou dieſt; he would have the wit to keep his lips
cloſe, and caſt the potion to the ground; [[Page
28]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=173) were it not for
their infideli­ty, ſo would men do to the moſt plauſible (but deadly) offers
of ſin. O Lord, ſince I know thy righteous judg­ments; teach me to tremble at
them; reſtrain thou my feet from every evill way; and teach me ſo to walk, as
one that looks every hour to ap­pear before thy juſt, and dreadfull Tribunal.

### 3.19. XIX

The longer I live, O my God, the more do I wonder at all the works of thine
hands: I ſee ſuch admirable artifice in the very leaſt and moſt deſpicable of
all thy creatures, as doth every day more and more aſtoniſh my obſervation: I
need not look [[Page
29]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=173) ſo far as
Heaven for matter of marvaile (though therein thou art infinitely glorious)
whiles I have but a ſpider in my window, or a bee in my garden, or a worm
under my feet: every one of theſe over­comes me with a juſt amaze­ment; yet
can I ſee no more then their very out-ſides; their inward form which gives
them their being, and operations, I cannot pierce in­to; the leſs I can know,
O Lord, the more let me won­der; and the leſs I can ſatis­fie my ſelf with
marvailing at thy works, the more let me adore the majeſty and omni­potence of
thee that wrough­teſt them.

[[Page 30]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=174)

### 3.20. XX.

Alas, my Lord God, what poor, weak, imperfit ſervices are thoſe (even at the
beſt) that I can preſent thee withal! How leane, lame, and ble­miſhed
ſacrifices do I bring to thine altar! I know thou art worthy of more then my
ſoul is capable to perform; and fain would I tender thee the beſt of thine
own: but, what I would that I do not; Rom. 7. 15. yea, cannot do: Surely, had
I not to do with an infinite mer­cy, I might juſtly look to be puniſhed for my
very obedi­ence: But now Lord my im­potence redounds to the praiſe of thy
goodneſs; for were I more anſwerable to thy juſtice the glory of thy mercy
would [[Page 31]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=174) be
ſo much leſs eminent in my remiſſion, & acceptance; Here I am before thee, to
await thy good pleaſure; thou knoweſt whether it be better to give me more
ability, or to accept of that poor ability thou haſt gi­ven me; but ſince,
when thou haſt given me moſt, I ſhall ſtill, and ever ſtand in need of thy
forgiveneſs; Let my hum­ble ſuit be to thee alwaies, ra­ther for pardon of my
defects, then for a ſupply of thy graces.

### 3.21. XXI.

O my God; how do I ſee many profane and careleſs ſouls ſpend their time in
jolli­ty and pleaſure.Jſa. 5. 12. The harp and the Viol, the Tabret and the
pipe, and wine are in their feaſts; Whiles I that deſire to [[Page
32]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=175) walk cloſe with
thee, in all conſcionable obedience, droop and languiſh under a dull
heavineſs, and heartleſs dejection: I am ſure I have a thouſand times more
cauſe of joy and cheerfulneſs, then the merrieſt of all thoſe wilde and
joviall ſpirits; they have a world to play withall, but I have a God to
rejoyce in; their ſports are triviall and momentanie; my joy is ſe­rious, and
everlaſting: One dram of my mirth is worth a pound of theirs; But, I
con­feſſe, O Lord, how much I am wanting to my ſelf in not ſtirring up this
holy fire of ſpirituall joy; but ſuffering it to lie raked up under the dead
aſhes of a ſad neglect: O thou, who art the God of [[Page
33]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=175) hope, quicken
this heavenly affection in my ſoul;Rom. 15. 13. and fill me with all joy and
peace in be­lieving; make my heart ſo much more light then the worldlings, by
how much my eſtate is happier.

### 3.22. XXII.

What ſhall I do Lord? I ſtrive and tug (what I may) with my naturall
corruptions,Epheſ. 6. 12. and with the ſpirituall wick­edneſses in high places
which ſet upon my ſoul; but ſome­times I am foyled, and go halting out of the
field; it is thy mercy that I live, being ſo fiercely aſſaulted by thoſe
principalities, and powers; it were more then wonder if I ſhould eſcape ſuch
hands without a wound: Even that [[Page
34]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=176) holy ſervant of
thine who ſtrove with thine Angel for a bleſſing, went limping away, though he
prevailed; what mervail is it that ſo weak a wretch as I, ſtriving with ma­ny
evill Angels for the avoi­dance of a curſe, come off with a maime, or a ſcar?
But bleſſed be thy name, the wounds that I receive are not mortall; and when I
fall, it is but to my knees; whence I riſe with new courage and hopes of
victory; Thou who art the God of all power, and keepeſt the keys of hell and
death, haſt ſaid, Reſiſt the De­vill, and he will flee from you; Lord, I do
and will by thy merciful ayd ſtill and ever re­ſiſt; make thou my faith as
ſtedfaſt, as my will is reſo­lute; [[Page
35]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=176) Oh ſtill teach
thou my hands to war, Pſal. 144. 1. and my fingers to fight; arme thou my ſoul
with ſtrength, and at laſt according to thy gracious promiſe, crown it with
victory.

### 3.23. XXIII.

Oh Lord God; how am­bitious, how covetous of knowledg is this ſoul of mine? as
the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, Eccleſ. 1. 8. nor the eare filled with
hearing; no more is the mind of man with underſtan­ding; yea, ſo inſatiable is
my heart, that the more I know, the more I deſire to know; and the leſs I
think I know: Under heaven there can be no bounds ſet to this intellectuall
appetite: O do thou ſtop the mouth of my ſoul with thy [[Page
36]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=177) ſelf,Pſ. 73.
25. who art infinite; Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon
earth that I deſire beſides thee: Alas, Lord, if I could know all creatures,
with all their forms, qualities, workings; if I could know as much as
inno­cent Adam, or wiſe Solomon; Yea more, if I could know all that is done in
earth or hea­ven, what were my ſoul the better, if it have not attained the
knowledg of thee: Since, as the Preacher hath moſt wiſely obſerved,Eccleſ. 1.
18. In much wiſdome is much grief, and he that increaſeth knowledg,
in­creaſeth ſorrow; Oh then, ſet off my heart from affecting that knowledg
whoſe end is ſorrow; and fix it upon that knowledg, which brings e­everlaſting
[[Page 37]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=177)
life:Joh. 17. 3. And this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God; and
Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.

### 3.24. XXIV.

O my God, what miſe­rable uncertainties there are in theſe worldly hopes! But
yeſterday I made account of an eminent advantage of my eſtate, which now ends
in a deep loſs. How did we late­ly feed our ſelves with the hope of a firme
and during peace, which now ſhuts up in too much bloud? How confidently did I
relie upon the promiſed favour of ſome great friends, which now leave me in
the ſuds, as the ſcorn of (a miſ-called) for­tune? In how ſlippery places,
[[Page 38]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=178) O Lord,
do our feet ſtand? If that may be ſaid to ſtand which is ever ſliding, never
fixed; And not more ſlippe­ry, then brittle; ſo as there is not more danger of
falling, then of ſinking: With thee, O God, with thee only, is a conſtant
immutability of hap­pineſs; There let me ſeek it, there let me finde it; and o
­ver-looking all the fickle ob­jects of this vain world, let my ſoul pitch it
ſelf up­on that bleſſed immortality which ere long it hopes to en­joy with
thee.

### 3.25. XXV.

Lord God, What a weari­ſome circle do I walk in here below; I ſleep, and
dreſs, and work, and eat, and work a­gain, [[Page
39]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=178) and eat again,
and un­dreſs, and ſleep again; and thus wearing out my time finde a ſatiety in
all theſe, troubleſome; Lord, when ſhall I come to that ſtate, wherein I ſhall
do nothing but injoy thee; do nothing but praiſe thee; and in that one work
ſhall finde ſuch infinite contentment, that my glorifi­ed ſoul cannot wiſh to
do any other? and ſhall therein alone beſtow a bleſſed eternity?

### 3.26. XXVI.

O God, how troubleſome and painful do I find this Sun of thine, whoſe
ſcorching beams beat upon my head? and yet, this excellent crea­ture of thine
is that, to which, under thee, we are beholden [[Page
40]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=179) for our very
life; and it is thy great bleſſing to the earth, that it may enjoy theſe
ſtrong and forceable rayes from it; Oh, Who ſhall be able to en­dure the
burning flames of thy wrath, which thou in­tendeſt for the puniſhment, and
everlaſting torment of thine enemies? And if men ſhall blaſpheme the name of
thee the God of heaven,Rev. 16. 9. for the great heat of that benefi­ciall
creature, what ſhall we think they will do for that fire which ſhall be
conſu­ming them to all eternity? Lord keep my ſoul from thoſe flames, which
ſhall be ever burning, and never, ei­ther quenched, or abated.

[[Page 41]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=179)

### 3.27. XXVII

Which way, O Lord, which way can I look, and not ſee ſome ſad examples of
miſery: One wants his limbs with Mephiboſheth, ano­ther his ſight with
Bartimeus, a third with Lazarus wants bread, and a whole skin; One is pained
in his body, another plundred of his eſtate, a third troubled in minde; one is
pined in priſon, another tor­tured on the rack, a third lan­guiſheth under the
loſs of a deare ſon, or wife or hus­band; Who am I Lord, that, for the
preſent, I enjoy an im­munity from all theſe ſor­rows? I am ſure none grones
under them that hath deſer­ved them more: It is thy [[Page
42]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=180) mercy, thy meer
mercy, O my good God, that any of theſe calamities have faln beſide me; Oh
make me truly thankful for thine infi­nite goodneſs; and yet onely ſo ſenſible
of thy gracious in­dulgence this way; as that when any of theſe evils ſhall
ſeize upon mee, I may be no more dejected in the ſenſe of them, then I am now
over-joyed with the favor of their forbearance.

### 3.28. XXVIII.

O bleſſed God, what va­riety of gifts haſt thou ſcatte­red amongſt the ſons of
men? To one thou haſt given vi­gor of body, to another agi­lity, beauty to a
third; to one depth of judgment, to ano­ther [[Page
43]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=180) quickneſs of
apprehen­ſion; to one readineſs and ra­rity of invention; to another tenacity
of memorie; to one the knowledg of liberal arts, to another the exquiſiteneſs
of manuary skill; to one worldly wealth, to another honour; to one a wiſe
heart, to another an eloquent tongue; to one more then enough, to another
content­ment with a little; to one valour, to another ſagacity: Theſe favors,
O Lord, thou haſt promiſcuouſly diſperſed amongſt both thy friends, and
enemies: but oh, how tranſcendent are thoſe ſpiritu­al mercies which thou haſt
reſerved for thine own; the graces of heavenly wiſdome, lively faith, fervent
charity, [[Page 44]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=181)
firme hope, joy in the holy Ghoſt and all the reſt of that divine beauye. For
any com­petency of the leaſt of thy common bleſſings I deſire to be thankful
to thy bounty; (for which of them, O God, can I either merit or requite?) but
oh for a ſoul truly and eagarly ambitious of thoſe thy beſt mercies; Oh let me
ever long for them, and ever be inſatiable of them; Oh do thou fill my heart
with the deſire of them, and let that deſire never finde it ſelf fil­led.

### 3.29. XXIX.

How comfortable a ſtyle is that, O God, which thine Apoſtle gives to thine
Heaven, whiles he cals it the inheritance [[Page
45]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=181) of the Saints
in light? None can come there but Saints; the roomes of this lower world are
taken up, common­ly, with wicked men, with beaſts, with Devils; but into that
heavenly Jeruſalem no unholy thing can enter; Nei­ther can any Saint be
exclu­ded thence; each of them have not only a ſhare, but an entire right to
thy glory: And how many juſt titles are there, O Saviour, to that re­gion of
bleſſedneſs; It is thy Fathers gift, it is thy pur­chaſe, it is thy Saints
inheri­tance; theirs only in thy right; by thy gracious adoption they are
ſons,Rom. 8. 17. and as ſons, heires: co-heirs with thee of that bleſſed
Patrimony; ſo feoffed upon them, ſo poſſeſ­ſed [[Page
46]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=182) of them, that
they can never be diſſeized: And, Lord, how glorious an inhe­ritance it is! An
inheritance in light: In light incompre­henſible, in light inacceſſible: Lo,
the moſt ſpirituall of all thy viſible creatures is light; and yet this light
is but the effect, and emanation of one of thy creatures, the Sun; and ſerves
only for the illumi­nation of this viſible world; but that ſupernal light is
from the Al-glorious beams of thy Divine Majeſty, diffuſing themſelves to
thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, both Angels, and Souls of thy Saints, who live in the
joyful fruition of thee, to all eternity: Alas, Lord, we do here dwell in
darkneſs, and under an uncomfortable [[Page
47]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=182) opacity, whiles
thy face is clouded from us with mani­fold temptations there above, with thee,
is pure light, a con­ſtant noon-tide of glory; I am here under a miſerable and
obſcure wardſhip; Oh teach me to deſpiſe the beſt of earth; and raviſh my ſoul
with a longing deſire of being poſſeſſed of that bleſſed inhe­ritance of the
Saints in light.

### 3.30. XXX.

What outward bleſſing can be ſweeter then civill peace? What judgment more
heavy then that of the ſword? Yet, O Saviour, there is a peace which thou
diſclaimeſt; and there is a ſword which thou challengeſt to bring; Peace with
our corruptions is warr [[Page
48]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=183) againſt thee;
and that war in our boſomes, wherein the ſpirit fighteth againſt the fleſh, is
peace with thee: O let thy good Spirit raiſe and foment this holy and
inteſtine war more and more within me. And as for my outward ſpirituall
enemies; how can there be a victory without war; and how can I hope for a
crown without victory? O do thou ever gird me with ſtrength to the battle;
inable thou me to reſiſt unto bloud; make me faithfull to the death, that thou
maiſt give me the crown of life.

### 3.31. XXXI.

O Lord God; how ſub­ject is this wretched heart of mine to repining, and
diſcon­tentment? [[Page
49]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=183) If it may not
have what it would, how ready it is (like a froward child) to throw away what
it hath. I know and feel this to be out of that naturall pride which is ſo
deep rooted in me; for could I be ſenſible enough of my own unworthineſſe, I
ſhould think every thing too good, every thing too much for me; my very being,
O Lord, is more then I am ever able to anſwer thee; and how could I deſerve it
when I was not? but that I have any helps of my wel-beeing here; or hopes and
means of my being glorious hereafter, how far is it beyond the reach of my
ſoul? Lord, let me finde my own nothingneſs; ſo ſhall I be thankfull for a
little, [[Page 50]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=184)
and, in my very want, bleſſe thee.

### 3.32. XXXII.

Where art thou, O my God? whither haſt thou withdrawn thy ſelf? it is not
long, ſince I found thy com­fortable preſence with my ſoul; now I miſſe thee,
and mourn and languiſh for thee: Nay, rather, where art thou O my ſoul? my God
is where he was; neither can be any other then himſelf; the change is in thee,
whoſe inconſtant diſpoſition varies continually, and cannot finde it ſelf
fixed upon ſo bleſſed an object. It will never be bet­ter with me, O my
God,Pſ. 51. 12. un­til it ſhall pleaſe thee to ſta­bliſh my heart with thy
free [[Page 51]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=184)
Spirit; and to keep it cloſe to thee, that it may not be carried away with
vain diſtractions, with ſinful temptations: Lord my God, as thou art alwaies
preſent with me, and canſt no more be abſent, then not be thy ſelf; ſo let me
be alwaies with thee, in an hum­ble, and faithful acknowledg­ment of thy
preſence; as I can never be out of thine all-ſeeing eye; ſo let mine eyes be
ever bent upon thee who art inviſible; Thou that haſt given me eyes, improve
them to thy glorie and my happi­neſs.

### 3.33. XXXIII.

My boſome, O Lord, is a Rebeccaes womb, there are twins ſtriving within it; a
[[Page 52]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=185) Jacob
and Eſau, the old man and the new: whiles I was in the barren ſtate of my
unre­generation all was quiet with­in me; now this ſtrife is both troubleſome,
and paine­ful; ſo as nature is ready to ſay,Gen. 25. 22. If it be ſo, why am I
thus? But withal, O my God, I bleſs thee for this happy un­quietneſs; for I
know there is juſt cauſe of comfort in theſe inward ſtruglings; my ſoul is now
not unfruitful, and is conceived with an holy ſeed which wreſtles with my
natural corruptions; and if my Eſau have got the ſtart in the priority of
time; yet my Jacob ſhall follow him hard at the heele, and happily ſup­plant
him; And though I muſt nouriſh them both, as [[Page
53]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=185) mine, yet I
can, through thy grace, imitate thy choice; and ſay with thee, Jacob have I
lo­ved, and Eſau have I hated; Bleſſed God, make thou that word of thine good
in me, That the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.

### 3.34. XXXIV.

Alas, my Lord God, how ſmall matters trouble me? every petty occurrence is
rea­dy to rob me of my peace; ſo as, me thinks, I am like ſome little cock-
boat in a rough Sea, which every bil­low topples up and down, and threats to
ſink: I can chide this weak puſillanimity in my ſelf; but it is thou that muſt
redreſs it: Lord, work my heart to ſo firme a ſetled­neſs [[Page
54]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=186) upon thee, that
it may never be ſhaken; no not with the violent guſts of temptation; much
leſſe with the eaſie gales of ſecular miſ-accidents: Even when I am hardeſt
preſſed, in the mul­titude of the ſorrows of my heart, let thy comforts
re­freſh my ſoul; but for theſe ſleight croſſes, oh teach me to deſpiſe them,
as not worthy of my notice, much leſs of my vexation: Let my heart be taken up
with thee, and then, what care I whether the world ſmile or frown.

### 3.35. XXXV.

What a comfort it is, O Saviour, that thou art the firſt fruits of them that
ſleep: Thoſe that die in thee, do but ſleep: [[Page
55]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=186) Thou ſaidſt ſo,
once, of thy Lazarus; and maiſt ſay ſo of him again; he doth but ſleep ſtill:
His firſt ſleep was but ſhort, this latter, though long­er, is no leſs true;
out of which he ſhall no leſs ſurely awake at thy ſecond call, then he did
before at thy firſt; His firſt ſleep and waking was ſin­gular, this latter is
the ſame with ours; we all lie down in our bed of earth, as ſure to wake, as
ever we can be to ſhut our eyes; In, and from thee, O bleſſed Saviour, is this
our aſſurance; who art the firſt fruits of them that ſleep: The firſt handfull
of the firſt fruits was not pre­ſented for it ſelf, but for the whole field,
wherein it grew: The vertue of that oblation [[Page
56]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=187) extended it
ſelf to the whole crop: Neither didſt thou, O bleſſed Jeſu, riſe again for thy
ſelf only, but the power and vertue of thy reſurrection reaches to all thine;
ſo thy choſen Veſſel tels us:1 Cor. 15. 23. Chriſt the firſt fruits,
afterwards they that are Chriſts at his coming: So as,Act. 24. 15. though the
reſurrection be of all the dead, both juſt and unjuſt; yet to riſe by the
pow­er of thy reſurrection, is ſo proper to thine own, as that thou, O
Saviour, haſt ſtyled it the reſurrection of the juſt; Luk. 14. 14. whiles the
reſt ſhall be drag'd out of their graves by the power of thy God-head to their
dreadful judgment: Al­ready therefore, O Jeſu, are we riſen in thee: and as
ſure ſhall riſe in our own perſons; [[Page
57]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=187) The Loco-motive
faculty is in the head; Thou who art our head art riſen, we who are thy
members muſt, and ſhall follow: Say then, O my dying body, ſay boldly unto
Death,Micah 7. 8. Rejoyce not over me, O mine enemy, for though I fall, yet I
ſhall riſe again: Yea, Lord, the vertue of thy firſt fruits diffuſeth it ſelf,
not to our riſing only, but to a bleſ­ſed immortality of theſe bodies of ours:
for, as thou didſt riſe immortall and glorious, ſo ſhall we by, and with
thee;Phil. 3. 21. Who ſhalt change theſe vile bodies, and make them like to
thy glorious body. The ſame power that could ſhake off death, can put on glory
and Majeſty: Lay thee down therefore, O my [[Page
58]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=188) body, quietly
and cheerfully; and look to riſe in another hue;1 Cor. 15. 42, 43. Thou art
ſown in cor­ruption, thou ſhalt be raiſed in incorruption; thou art ſown in
diſhonour, thou ſhalt be rai­ſed in glory; thou art ſown in weakneſſe, but
ſhalt be raiſed in power.

### 3.36. XXXVI.

In this life, in this death of the body; O Lord, I ſee there are no degrees,
though differences of time; The man that dyed yeſterday is as truly dead, as
Abel the firſt man that dyed in the world; and Methuſelah that lived nine
hundred ſixty nine years, did not more truly live, then the childe that did
but ſalute, and leave the world; but in the [[Page
59]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=188) life to come,
and the ſecond death, there are degrees; de­grees of bleſſedneſs to the
glorified, degrees of torments to the damned; the leaſt whereof is
unſpeakable, un­conceivable: Oh thou that art the Lord of life and death, keep
my ſoul from thoſe ſteps that go down to the cham­bers of death; and once ſet
it (for higher I dare not ſue to go) but over the threſhold of glory and
bleſſedneſs.

### 3.37. XXXVII.

O Lord my God, I am as very a Pilgrime as ever walk­ed upon thy earth; Why
ſhould I look to be in any better condition then my neighbours, then my
fore­fathers? Even the beſt of [[Page
60]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=189) them, that were
moſt fixed upon their inheritance, were no other then ſtrangers at home: It
was not in the pow­er of the world to naturalize them, much leſs to make them
enroll themſelves free-Denizons here below; they knew their country, which
they ſought,Heb. 11. 13, 14, 15. was above; ſo infinitely rich, and pleaſant,
that theſe earthly regions which they muſt paſs tho­rough, are, in compariſon,
worthy of nothing but con­tempt.

My condition is no other then theirs; I wander here in a ſtrange country; What
wonder is it, if I meet with forrainers fare, hard uſage, and neglect? Why do
I in­termeddle with the affaires of [[Page
61]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=189) a nation that
is not mine? Why do I clog my ſelf in my way with the baſe and heavy lumber of
the world? Why are not my affections home­ward? Why do I not long to ſee and
enjoy my fathers houſe? O my God, thou that haſt put me into the ſtate of a
Pilgrim, give me a Pil­grims heart; ſet me off from this wretched world
wherein I am; let me hate to think of dwelling here; Let it be my only care
how to paſs through this miſerable wilderneſs to the promiſed land of a
bleſſed eternitie.

### 3.38. XXXVIII.

One Talent at the leaſt, O Lord, haſt thou put into my hand; and that ſum is
great [[Page 62]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=190) to
him that is not worth a dram; but, alas, what have I done with it? I confeſs I
have not hid it in a napkin; but have been laying it out to ſome poor
advantage; yet ſurely the gain is ſo unanſwer­able, that I am afraid of an
Audit: I ſee none of the ap­proved ſervants in the Goſpel brought in an
increaſe of leſs value then the receit; I fear I ſhall come ſhort of the
ſum.Luk. 19. 16. 17, 18, 19. O thou, who juſtly holdeſt thy ſelf wronged with
the ſtyle of an auſtere maſter, vouchſafe to accept of my ſo mean improvement;
and thou, who valuedſt the poor widows mites above the rich gifts caſt into
thy Treaſurie, be pleaſed to allow of thoſe few pounds that my weak in­devors
[[Page 63]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=190) could
raiſe from thy ſtock; and mercifully reward thy ſervant, not according to his
ſucceſs, but according to his true intentions of glorify­ing thee.

### 3.39. XXXIX.

What a word is this which I hear from thee, O Saviour; Behold I ſtand at the
doore and knock! Thou which art the Lord of life, God bleſſed for ever, to
ſtand and knock at the door of a ſinful heart! Oh what a praiſe is this of thy
mercy and long ſuffering? What a ſhame to our dull neglect and graceleſs
ingrati­tude?Pſ. 40. 1. For a David to ſay I waited patiently upon the Lord;
Truly my ſoul waiteth upon God; Pſ. 62. 1. it is but meet and come­ly; [[Page
64]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=191) for it is no
other then the duty of the greateſt Mo­narchs on earth, yea, of the higheſt
Angels in Heaven to attend their Maker; but for thee the great God of Heaven
to wait at the door of us ſin­ful duſt and aſhes, what a condeſcenſion is
this, what a longanimity? It were our happineſs, O Lord, if upon our greateſt
ſuit and importu­nity we might have the favor to entertain thee into our
hearts; but that thou ſhouldſt importune us to admit thee, and ſhouldſt wait
at the poſts of our doors,Cant. 5. 2. till thine head be filled with dew, and
thy locks with the drops of the night, it is ſuch a mercy, as there is not
room enough in our ſouls to wonder at. In the mean [[Page
65]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=191) time what ſhall
I ſay to our wretched unthankfulnes; and impious negligence? Thou haſt
graciouſly invited us to thee, and haſt ſaid; knock and it ſhall be opened;
and yet thou continueſt knocking at our doors, and we open not; willingly
delaying to let in our happineſs; we know how eaſie it were for thee to break
open the braſen doors of our breſts, and to come in; but the Kingdome of
Heaven ſuffers not violence from thee, though it ſhould ſuffer it from us;
Thou wilt do all thy works in a ſweet and gra­cious way; as one who will not
force, but win love; Lord, I cannot open unleſs thou that knock'ſt for
en­trance, wilt be pleaſed to in­able [[Page
66]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=192) me with
ſtrength to turn the key, and to unbolt this unweldy bar of my ſoul. O do thou
make way for thy ſelf by the ſtrong motions of thy bleſſed Spirit, into the
in-moſt rooms of my heart; and do thou powerfully in­cline me to mine own
happi­neſs: els, thou ſhalt be ever excluded, and I ſhall be ever miſerable.

### 3.40. XLI.

In what pangs couldſt thou be, O Aſaph, that ſo woful a word ſhould fall from
thee, Hath God forgotten to be graci­ous? Pſ. 77▪ 9. Surely, the temptation
went ſo high, that the next ſtep had been blaſphemie; Had not that good God,
whom thy bold weakneſs [[Page
67]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=192) queſtions for
forgetfulneſs, in great mercy remembred thee, and brought thee ſpee­dily to
remember thy ſelf and him, that which thou con­feſſeſt to have been infirmity,
had proved a ſinful deſpair: I dare ſay for thee, that word waſhed thy cheeks
with many a tear, and was worthy of more; For, O God, What can be ſo dear to
thee as the glory of thy mercy? There is none of thy bleſſed attributes which
thou deſireſt to ſet forth ſo much unto the ſons of men, and ſo much
abhor­reſt to be diſparaged by our detraction, as thy mercy: Thou canſt, O
Lord, forget thy diſpleaſure againſt thy people; thou canſt forget our
iniquities, and caſt our ſins [[Page
68]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=193) out of thy
remembrance;Micha. 7. 18, 19. but thou canſt no more forget to be gracious,
then thou canſt ceaſe to be thy ſelf; O my God, I ſin againſt thy juſtice
hourly, and thy mercy inter­poſes for my remiſſion; but oh keep me from
ſinning a­gainſt thy mercy; What plea can I hope for, when I have made my
Advocate mine e­nemy?

### 3.41. XLI.

How happy, O Lord, is the man that hath thee for his God? He can want nothing
that is good; he can be hurt by nothing that is evill; his ſins are pardoned,
his good indeavors are accepted; his croſſes are ſanctified; his prayers are
heard; all that he [[Page
69]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=193) hath are
bleſſings, all that he ſuffers are advantages; his life is holy, his death
com­fortable, his eſtate after death glorious; Oh that I could feel thee to be
my God; that I could enjoy an heavenly communion with thee; In vain ſhould
earth or hell labour to make me other then bleſſed.

### 3.42. XLII.

How juſt a motion is this of thine, O thou ſweet ſinger of Iſrael; Pſal. 31.
23. O love the Lord, all ye his Saints; Surely they can be no Saints that love
not ſuch a Lord; Had he never been good to them, yet that infinite goodneſs
which is in himſelf, would have com­manded love from Saints: [[Page
70]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=194) Yet, how could
they have been Saints, if he had wholly kept his goodneſs to himſelf? In that
then he hath made them Saints, he hath com­municated his goodneſs to them, and
challengeth all love from them; and being made ſuch, how infinitely hath he
obliged them with all kinds of mercies? How can ye chooſe O ye Saints but love
the Lord? What have ye, what are ye, what can ye be, but from his meer
boun­ty? They are ſleight favours that he hath done you for the world; in
theſe his very ene­mies ſhare with you; How tranſcendent are his ſpirituall
obligations! Hath he not given you his Angels for your attendants; himſelf for
[[Page 71]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=194) your
Protector; his Son out of his boſome for your Re­deemer; his Spirit for your
Comforter; his heaven for your inheritance? If gifts can attract love; O my
God, Who can have any intereſt in my heart but thy bleſſed ſelf, that haſt
been ſo infinitely munificent to my ſoul? Take it to thee, thou that haſt made
and bought it; enamour it thoroughly of thy goodneſs; make me ſick of love;
yea let me die for love of thee, who haſt loved me unto death that I may fully
enjoy the perfecti­on of thy love, in the height of thy glory.

### 3.43. XLIII.

Lord, how have I ſeen men miſcarried into thoſe ſins, the [[Page
72]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=195) premonition
whereof they would have thought incredi­ble, and their yeildance there­to,
impoſſible? How many Hazaels hath our very age yeilded, that if a Prophet
ſhould have fore told their acts,2 Kings. 8. 13. would have ſaid, Is thy
ſervant a dog that he ſhould do theſe great things? Oh my God, why do not I
ſuſpect my ſelf? What hold have I of my ſelf more then theſe o­ther miſerable
examples of humane frailtie?

Lord God, if thou take off thy hand from me, what wickedneſs ſhall eſcape me?
I know I cannot want a temp­ter; and that tempter cannot want either power, or
malice, or skill, or vigilance▪ or baits, or opportunities; and for my [[Page
73]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=195) ſelf, I find
too well, that of my ſelf I have no ſtrength to reſiſt any of his temptations:
O for thy mercies ſake, up­hold thou me with thy migh­ty hand; ſtand cloſe to
me in all aſſaults; ſhew thy ſelf ſtrong in my weakneſs:Pſal. 19. 13. Keep
back thy ſervant from preſump­tuous ſins; Let them not have dominion over me;
then (onely) ſhall I be upright, and ſhall be in­nocent from the great
tranſgreſ­ſion.

### 3.44. XLIV.

It is thy title, O Lord, and only thine, that thou giveſt ſongs in the night:
Job 35. 10. The night is a ſad and dolorous ſeaſon;Eccleſ. 11. 7. as the light
contrarily is the image of cheerfulneſs; like as it is in bodily pains and
aches, [[Page 74]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=196)
that they are ſtill worſt to­wards night; ſo it is in the cares and griefs of
mind; then they aſſault us moſt when they are helpt on by the ad­vantage of an
uncomfortable darkneſs: Many men can give themſelves ſongs in the day of their
proſperity; who can but howl in the night of their affliction;Act. 16. 25. but
for a Paul and Silas to ſing in their priſon at mid-night; for an Aſaph to
call to remembrance his ſong in the night, Pſ. 77. 6. this comes onely from
that Spirit of thine, whoſe peculiar ſtyle is the Comforter: And ſurely, as
mu­ſick ſounds beſt in the night, ſo thoſe heavenly notes of praiſe which we
ſing to thee our God in the gloomy darkneſs of our adverſity, cannot but
[[Page 75]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=196) be moſt
pleaſing in thine ears: Thine Apoſtle bids us (which is our ordinary wont)
when we are merry to ſing, when af­flicted, to pray; but if when we are
afflicted we can ſing, (as alſo when we are merrieſt we can pray) that ditty
muſt needs be ſo much more ac­ceptable to thee, as it is a more powerful
effect of the joy of thy Holy Ghoſt; O my God, I am conſcious of my own
infirmity; I know I am natu­rally ſubject to a dull and hea­vy dumpiſhneſs,
under what­ſoever affliction; Thou that art the God of all comfort, re­medy
this heartleſs diſpoſiti­on in me; pull this lead out of my boſome; make me
not pa­tient only, but cheerful under my trials, fill thou my heart [[Page
76]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=197) with joy, and
my mouth with ſongs in the night of my tri­bulation.

### 3.45. XLV.

It is a true word, O Lord, that thy Seer ſaid of thee long ago;1 Sam. 16. 7.
The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth: Man ſees the face, thou ſeeſt the heart; man
ſees things as they ſeem, thou ſeeſt them as they are; many things are hid
from the eyes of men, all things lie open and diſplaid before thee. What a
madneſs then were it in me to come diſguiſed into thy preſence, & to ſeek to
hide my counſels from thine al-ſeeing eyes? I muſt be content, Lord, to be
deluded here by fair appea­rances; for I may not offer to look into the boſoms
of men, [[Page 77]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=197)
which thou haſt reſerved for thy ſelf; it is only the out-ſide that I can judg
by; Yea, O God, if I ſhall caſt my eyes in­ward, and look into my own breſt,
even there I find my ſelf baffled at home; The heart of man is deceitful above
all things; who can know it? None but thoſe piercing eyes of thine can
diſcover all the windings and turnings of that intricate piece. What would it
avail me, O Lord, to mock the eyes of all the world with a ſemblance of
holineſs, whilſt thou ſhouldſt ſee me falſe and filthy? Should I be cenſured
by a world of men, when I am ſecretly allowed by thee, I could contemn it, yea
glory in their unjuſt reproach; But if thine eye ſhall note me guil­ty, [[Page
78]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=198) to what purpoſe
is all the applauſe of men? O thou that art the God of truth; do thou open,
and diſſect this cloſe heart of mine; ſearch every fibre that is in, or about
it; and if thou findeſt any ill blood there, let it out; and if thou findeſt
any hollowneſs, fill it up; and ſo work upon it, that it may be approved of
thee that madeſt it; as for men, it ſhall be alike to me whether they ſpend
their breath or ſave it.

### 3.46. XLVI.

Lord God, What a world of treaſure haſt thou hid in the bowels of the earth,
which no eye of man ever did, or ſhall, or can ſee? What good­ly plants haſt
thou brought [[Page
79]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=198) forth of the
earth, in wilde, unknown regions, which no man ever beheld? What great wits
haſt thou ſhut up in a willing obſcurity, which the world never takes notice
of? In all which thou ſheweſt, that it is not only the uſe and benefit of man
which thou re­gardeſt in the great variety of thy creation, and acts of
ad­miniſtration of the world; but thine own glory, and the ful­filling of
thine own good pleaſure; and if onely the An­gels of heaven be witneſſes of
thy great works, thou canſt not want a due celebration of thy praiſe; It is
juſt with thee, O God, that thou ſhouldſt regard only thy bleſ­ſed ſelf, in
all that thou doeſt, or haſt done; for all is thine, [[Page
80]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=199) and thou art
all: Oh that I could ſincerely make thee the perfect ſcope of all my thoughts,
of all my actions; that ſo we may both meet in one and the ſame happy end, thy
glory in my eternall bleſ­ſedneſs.

### 3.47. XLVII.

Indeed, Lord, as thou ſaiſt, the night commeth when no man can work; What can
we do, when the light is ſhut in, but ſhut our eyes, and ſleep? When our
ſenſes are tyed up, and our limbs laid to reſt, what can we do, but yeeld our
ſelves to a neceſſary repoſe? O my God, I perceive my night haſtening on
apace, my Sun draws low, the ſhadows lengthen, vapours riſe, and [[Page
81]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=199) the air begins
to darken; Let me beſtir my ſelf for the time; let me loſe none of my few
hours; Let me work hard a while; becauſe I ſhall ſoon reſt everlaſtingly.

### 3.48. XLVIII.

Thou ſeeſt, Lord, how apt I am to contemn this body of mine; Surely when I
look back upon the ſtuffe whereof it is made, no better then that I tread
upon; and ſee the loathſomneſs of all kinds that comes from it; and feel the
pain that it oft times puts me to, and conſider whither it is going, and how
noiſome it is above all other creatures upon the diſſoluti­on; I have much
adoe to hold good terms with ſo [[Page
82]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=200) unequal a
partner; But on the other ſide; when I look up to thy hand, and ſee how
fearfully and wonderfully thou haſt made it; what infi­nite coſt thou haſt
beſtowed upon it, in that thou haſt not thought thine own blood too dear to
redeeme it; that thou haſt ſo far honour'd it, as to make it the Temple of thy
holy Ghoſt; and to admit it into a bleſſed communion with thy ſelf; and haſt
de­creed to do ſo great things for it hereafter; even to cloath it with
immortality, and to make it like unto thy glorious body; I can bleſs thee for
ſo happy a mate; and with pati­ence digeſt all theſe neceſſary infirmities;
and now I look upon this fleſh, not as it is, [[Page
83]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=200) withered and
wrinkled; but as it will be, ſhining and glo­rified. O Lord, how vile ſo ever
this clay is in it ſelf; yet make mee in thine intereſt and my hopes ſo
enamoured of it, as if I did already finde it made celeſtial. Oh that my faith
could prevent my change, and anticipate my enſuing glory.

### 3.49. XLIX.

Lord, what a dreadful fa­vor was that which thou ſhewedſt to thy Prophet
Elijah, to ſend a fiery chariot for him, to conveigh him up to Heaven! I
ſhould have thought that the ſight of ſo terrible a carriage ſhould have
fetcht away his ſoul before­hand, and have left the body [[Page
84]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=201) groveling on
the earth: But that good Spirit of thine, which had fore-ſignified that fiery
rapture, had doubtleſs fore-armed thy ſervant with an anſwerable reſolution to
expect, and undergoe it: Ei­ther he knew that chariot, how ever fearful in the
appea­rance, was onely glorious, and not penal; Or els he cheerfully reſolved
that ſuch a momentany pain in the change would be followed with an eternity of
happineſs: O God, we are not worthy to know whereto thou haſt reſerved us:
Perhaps thou haſt appointed us to be in the number of thoſe, whom thou ſhalt
finde alive at thy ſecond coming; and then the caſe will be ours; we ſhall
paſs [[Page 85]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=61215&page=201)
through fire to our immorta­lity: or, if thou haſt ordained us to a ſpeedier
diſpatch, per­haps thou haſt decreed that our way to thee ſhall be through a
fiery triall. O God, what ever courſe thou in thine holy wiſdom haſt
determined for the fetching up my ſoul from this vale of miſery, and tears,
prepare me thoroughly for it; and do thou work my heart to ſo lively a faith
in thee, that all the terrours of my death may be ſwallowed up in an aſſured
expectation of my ſpeedy glory: and that my laſt groans ſhall be imme­diately
ſeconded with eternall Allelujahs, in the glorious Chore of thy Saints and
Angels in Heaven. Amen. Amen.

FINIS.
