They are of Establish'd Fame, and already receiv'd, and allow'd the best Patriots, as well as Poets. I am sensible, that should we consult our superficial Hy­pocriticks, they would often be apt to arraign the Numbers; for there are a sort of Men, who ha­ving little other merit, than a happy chime, would fain fix the Excellence of Poetry in the smoothness of the Versification, allowing but little to the more Essential Qualities of a Poet, great Images, good Sense, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> Nay they have so blind a Pas­sion for what they Excell in, that they will ex­clude all variety of Numbers from <span class="hi">English</span> Poetry, when they allow none but <span class="hi">Iambics,</span> which must by an identy of sound bring a very unpleasing sa­tiety upon the Reader. I must own that I am of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e271"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36411&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> opinion that a great many rough Cadencies that are to be found in these Poems, and in the admi­rable <span class="hi">Paradise Lost,</span> are so far from Faults that they are Beauties, and contribute by their variety to the prolonging the pleasure of the Readers. But I have unawares faln into this Digression, which requires more time and room than I have here to allow to set to it, in that just Light it requires. I shall return to the following Poems, writ by Mr. <span class="hi">Milton,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Marvell, &amp;c.</span> which will shew us, that there is no where a greater Spirit of Li­berty to be found, than in those who are Poets; <span class="hi">Homer, Aristophanes,</span> and most of the inspired Tribe have shewed it; and <span class="hi">Catullus</span> in the midst of <span class="hi">Caesar</span>'s Triumphs attack'd the Vices of that great Man, and expos'd 'em to lessen that Popularity and Power he was gaining among the <span class="hi">Roman</span> People, which he saw would be turn'd to the de­struction of the Liberty of <span class="hi">Rome.</span></p><div class="q">Quis hoc potest videre, quis potest pati, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span></div><p>And </p><div class="q"><div class="l">Pulchre convenit improbis cinaedis</div> <div class="l">Mamurrae,, Pathicoque, Caesarique.</div></div><p>And again <span class="q">‘Nil nimium studeo Caesar tibi velle placere, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span>’</span></p><p>But it would be endless to quote all the Liber­ties the Poets have of old taken with Ill men, whose Power had aw'd others to a servile Flatte­ry; the succeeding Tyrants have not been able to suppress the numerous Instances we have yet of it. We have therefore reason to hope that no <span class="hi">English­man</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e340"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=36411&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> that is a true lover of his Countries Good and Glory, can be displeased at the publishing a Col­lection, the design of each of which was to re­move those pernicious Principles which lead us directly to Slavery; to promote a Publick and Generous Spirit, which was then almost a shame to the Possessor, if not a certain Ruine. I believe were a man of equal Ability and unbyass'd Tem­per to make a just Comparison, some of the fol­lowing Authors might claim perhaps an equal share with many of the most celebrated of the <span class="hi">Ro­mans</span> or <span class="hi">Greeks.</span> I know in a Nation so factious as this, where the preposterous Principles of Sla­very are run into a point of Conscience and Ho­nour, and yet hold abundance in unseasonable and monstrous Divisions, it would be a task that must disoblige too many to undertake. But when all <span class="hi">Europe</span> is engag'd to destroy that tyrannick Power, the mismanagement of those Times, and the selfish evil Designs of a corrupt Court had gi­ven Rise to, it cannot be thought unseasonable to publish so just an Account of the true sourse of all our present Mischiefs; which will be evidently found in the following Poems, for from them we may collect a just and secret History of the for­mer Times.</p><div class="q"><div class="l">And looking backward with a wise Affright,</div> <div class="l">See Seams of Wounds dishonest to the Sight.</div></div><p>Oh that we cou'd yet learn, under this Auspi­cious Government founded on Liberty, the gene­rous principles of the Publick Good!

Such great Actions and Lives, deserving rather to be the Subjects of the noblest Pens and divine Fancies, than of such small Beginners and weak Essayers in Poetry as my self. Against these dangerous Prejudices, there remains no other Shield, than the Universal Esteem and Authority which your Iudgment and Approbation carries with it. The Right you have to them, Sir, is not only on the account of the Relation you had to this great Person, nor of the gene­ral favour which all Arts receive from you; but more particularly by reason of that Obligation and Zeal, with which I am bound to dedicate my self to your Service: For having been a long time the Object of you Care and Indul­gence towards the advantage of my Studies and Fortune, having been moulded (as it were) by your own Hands, and formed under your Government; not to intitle you to any thing which my meanness produces, would not only be Injustice, but Sacrilege: So that if
