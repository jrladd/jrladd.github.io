And because many take great offence at this doctrine of truth, and work of God, I will (the Lord assisting me) plainly, and briefly, as I can, proue, that all events, even those most sin­full (in regard of the creatures work in, and of them) come to passe necessarily, after a sort, in respect of Gods provi­dence, as being a hand steady, and which swarveth not in or­dering the creature in, and unto the same.</p><p>My first proofe is from <span class="hi">Act. 2. 22. 23, &amp; ch. 4. 27. 28.

If he had not decreed to suffer them, he had not suffered them; if he had not suffered them, they could not haue done it: but that he onely suffered them, is against the expresse words and meaning of the text, which sayth, the <span class="hi">wicked took</span> him, <span class="hi">being delivered by Gods determinato counsell.</span> Is to deliver by determinate counsell, to suffer onely? So where it is sayd, that Gods <span class="hi">hand determined</span> that which <span class="hi">was done,</span> it shewes that God was a doer in the businesse, and not a sufferer onely. If God onely suffered them, (that is, hin­dred them not) he had no hand in it at all, but with-held his hand from medling in it. How then could his <span class="hi">hand and coun­seli determine before whatsoever was done?</span> Besides, if God one­ly suffered the death of his sonne, all the worth of our re­demption by his death, vanisheth away: seeing that which God suffers onely, is onely evill, and not good. Also by this perverse exposition, neither the Father <span class="hi">gaue his sonne,</span> nor the sonne <span class="hi">himselfe for us to the death,</span> which the Scriptures every where affirme. Lastly, hee that considers the end of the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note21">Ioh. 3. 16. Gal. 2. 20. 1. Ioh. 4. 9. Rom 5. vers 25. 29.</span> Churches prayer, <span class="hi">Act.</span> 4. will plainly see how they meant therein to ascribe unto God more then the sole suffering of those things. The end was to comfort themselues and other Gods servants against the <span class="hi">threatnings</span> and <span class="hi">rage</span> of the wicked in all their persecutions. But what comfort (I marvail) can the servants of God draw from this consideration, that God suf­fers the wicked in rage to persecute them, and hinders <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e700"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=6">[Page 6]</a></span> them not. This were indeed rather matter of discourage­ment and dispaire, then of comfort unto them. But herein stands their comfort firme, that God by the hand of his pro­vidence orders all these things according to the fore-determi­nation of the counsel of his will. Neither wil their vain imagi­nation helpe them, that <span class="hi">Christ might haue been slain, and become our sacrifice, yet without sinne.</span> For howsoeevr it bee not for them, nor me, to determine what was possible to Gods abso­lute power; yet we know, considering the declaration there­of both by the Scriptures and event, that in regard of Gods decree, it was necessarie that Christ should dye, as he did, by the conspiracie and rage of wicked men; as both the expresse words, and plain drift of the places proue. Lastly, it is an er­roneous presumption, that <span class="hi">God might haue appointed some to haue sacrificed his sonne Christ, as he did Abraham to sacrifice his sonne Isaac,</span> to wit, <span class="hi">in obedience to Gods commandement,</span> conside­ring how expresly the Scriptures did even before his death, teach the contrary: and that <span class="hi">the sonne of man must suffer many things, and be killed by the Elders and chiefe Priest.</span> Also that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note22">Mark. 3. 31.

If that cannot but be, which the Scriptures fore-tell, and that the Scriptures fore-told that Christ must thus be killed and crucified by the hands of wic­ked men, then was it necessary (and could not otherwise be) in regard of Gods decree, that Christ should die as he did, and not without sinne in them that killed him.</p><p>To conclude this place: These men granting, that God de­creed the death of his sonne, but denying that he decreed the meanes and manner thereof, make the most wise God like weak man, who often resolues of a thing to bee done, but takes time to consider of the manner of doing it.</p><p>Neither yet doe we, by all this, make God the <span class="hi">appointer of</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e768"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=6">[Page 7]</a></span> <span class="hi">evill</span> in their meaning, that is, either the commander, or wor­ker, or approver thereof; but onely the supreme governour of the whole world, and of all persons and actions therein, how sinfull soever; using and ordering the covetousnesse of <span class="hi">Iudas,</span> the envy of the Priests, and injustice of <span class="hi">Pilate</span> to this e­vent of Christs death; in regard of them most wicked, but of God, most gracious; and to us, most profitable.</p><p>Take we one other instance, for this purpose, from God<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> threatning of <span class="hi">David</span> by the Prophet, for his sinne against <span class="hi">Vriah.

Is to <span class="hi">do</span> to <span class="hi">suffer</span> with these men? Tell me, you poore seduced soules, doth not the Lord here threaten a judgement from him to come upon<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note24">2 King. 29▪ 19. Psal. 119. 160, 164▪</span> <span class="hi">David</span> for his sin? Are not <span class="hi">all Gods judgements good and righ­teous?</span> Doth the Iudge onely suffer the punishment of the ma­lefactors, and not inflict or procure it? The scriptures teach, and these men acknowledge, that <span class="hi">whatsoever is good, commeth from the father of lights:</span> Are not Gods judgements (wherof this is one) good in truth, though both evill to mans sence, as this was to <span class="hi">Davids;</span> and worse sometimes in the instruments both intention and action, as it was in <span class="hi">Absoloms?</span> It is therefore evi­dent, that the same thing, in divers respects, was both the hor­rible sin of <span class="hi">Absolom,</span> and the severe punishment of <span class="hi">David,</span> and the just judgment of God. Take a familiar similitude for the explaining of this matter. The water is of it selfe apt and prone to flow to and fro. The husbandman by h<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s artificiall ditches and trenches, brings it to this or that place, in this or that measure, at this or that time, and so for other circumstan­ces: yet doth not he at all work the disposition of flowing in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e871"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=7">[Page 8]</a></span> the water, but finding it there, makes use of it for his purpose, and by his skill leads the water whither seems good unto him. So neither did the Lord infuse at all corrupt on into <span class="hi">Absolom,</span> but finding it there by the Divels and his owne work, ordered it to that his holy end, the glory of his justice in punishing the heynous sins of <span class="hi">David:</span> of which punishment he was the authour.</p><p>These men grant, that <span class="hi">God foreseeth all evill to come.</span> This foresight of God they will not deny to bee certain, and that wherein God cannot be deceived. Whereupon it followes, that such evils so foreseen, necessarily and unavoydably come to passe. If any object, that Gods foresight is not the cause of the evill. I answer, no more is his decree or work of provi­vidence about it. It sufficeth for the purpose in hand, if it follow by way of event or consequence upon the antecedent, though not of effect upon the cause. Let us yet a little fur­ther open this poynt. This knowledge, or fore-knowledge of God, is two-fold: naturall and indefinite, by which God knowes all possible things, and whatsoever in any respect, or upon any supposition, can possibly be: or definit<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>, and deter­minate, by which of things possible he knowes what shall and what shall not be. Now howsoever this fore-knowledge (as all other things in God) be one, and that infinite and eter­nall; yet in our conception, the former of those acts of Gods fore-knowledge, goes before the decree, the latter presuppo­seth it. For therefore God certainly and infallibly forsees a thing shall be, because he unchangeably decrees it shall be in and according to its kind: if good, by his working it: if evill, by his suffering it, and governing the creature in wor­king it.</p><p>But you will answer, that God from eternity certainly and infallibly fore-saw <span class="hi">Absoloms</span> incest, because <span class="hi">Absolom</span> would certainly and undoubtedly practise it in time. But I would further know, whence this certainty and undoubtednesse of <span class="hi">Absoloms</span> such practise should arise, so as it could not possibly but be, nor God be deceived in that his prescience or fore­knowledge? <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e914"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=7">[Page 9]</a></span> It was not of any absolute necessitie of it self, that <span class="hi">Absolom</span> should be born: or being born, that he should be preserved, and surviue to that time: or being till then pre­served, that he should haue naturall ability, and opportunitie therewith to practise that sin: seeing it was not impossible, but that <span class="hi">David</span> might haue taken his wiues with him, or they haue fled els whither, and haue hid themselues. In all these things God was not a meere sufferer, but a powerful worker by his providence. But suppose the being of all these things as they were; and withall, <span class="hi">Absoloms</span> heart by the Divels work, and his owne, fraught with lust, and impiety this way; yet was <span class="hi">Absalom</span> a changeable creature, haveing in himself free­dom, or libertie of will to haue forborn that act at that time, or to haue exercised his lust upon some other object. How then could that particular event follow unchangeably from his changeable will? How necessarily and inavoydably, from his choyce of will which was free in it self either to that act, or to another of that kinde, or to neither? Either therefore Gods decree from eternitie (and so his work in time) must be acknowledged for the disposing and ordering of all events unavoydably, or his knowledge be denied in foreseeing them infallibly.</p><p>Lastly, to affirme that any thing, great or small, good or evill, comes to passe in the world, without Gods providence ordering and governing it and them that doe it, is to set the creature from under the Creators rule and dominion there­in; and to shut God out of the earth, whilst men doe what they list in it, he letting them alone, and not medling with them.</p><p>How <span class="hi">Adam had power from the creation of God not to sin</span> which<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note25">Pag. 5.</span> they urge in the nextplace, we shal shew hereafter. In the mean while, their addition, that <span class="hi">Gods cōmanding him not to sin, and yet his decreeing that he should sin, are contrary, as light and darknes,</span> is faulty both in regard of our assertion, and their own. For us, we do not hold, that God decreed <span class="hi">Adams</span> sin, as they con­ceiue, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e957"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=8">[Page 10]</a></span> that is, either to approue it, or command it, or compell unto it, nothing lesse: but this we affirm, that God decreed to leaue <span class="hi">Adam</span> to himself in the temptation, and not to assist him with that strength of grace, by which he could (if he would) haue upheld him; and so to order both him, and all things about him, in that his temptation, as that, he, by the motion and sway of his own free-will, following his naturall appetite to the pleasant, but forbidden fruit, and that false perswasion wherewith his understanding was by Sathan o­verclouded, should both choose and eat the forbidden fruit. Neither are these two things contrary, that God should for­bid a thing, and yet decree that it should come to passe in the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note26">Gen. 22.</span> manner fore-mentioned. God commanded <span class="hi">Abraham</span> to kill his son, as it was a tryall of his obedience: and yet decreed that the event of killing should not follow, as we know.

To the second also, I answer, that God making <span class="hi">Adam</span> changeably good by created nature, might (had it seemed so good to his infinite wisedom) haue kept him by grace from possibility of break­ing his righteous Law, in our meaning, notwithstanding tho <span class="hi">annexing of the penalty,</span> and that to great good purpose; <span class="hi">viz.</span> both to shew how God hates all transgressing of his Law, against the breach whereof he denounceth such judgement; and also, as a meanes (by his blessing and grace) effectually for the keeping of <span class="hi">Adam</span> from breaking it: which use also it should haue had, if <span class="hi">Adam</span> had done his duety in constant obedience, and that God, by his most powerfull grace had so preserved him, that he had not sinned.</p><p>For the third Reason: First I demand, what necessity there was that <span class="hi">God should haue use</span> (as they speak) <span class="hi">towards men of the attributes of his justice to punish sin, and of his mercy to par­don it upon repentance?</span> Would it haue been any diminution of his perfection, and happinesse if he had not so done? Doth not the glory of God also even most brightly shine in the <span class="hi">elect Angels,</span> which haue been and shall be kept un­changeably holy and without sin for ever? and in regard of whom those holy Attributes, of justice in punishing, and mer­cy in pardoning haue no use. But obserue (good Reader) how these men are taken inavoydably in their own snare. It is not mans being made changeable, and such as might sin, by which their could come to be <span class="hi">use of Gods attributes of ju­stice for the punishing of sin; and mercy for the pardoning of it;</span> except withall man become actually changed, and sinfull. Can there be <span class="hi">use of justice for punishing,</span> or <span class="hi">of mercy for fore­giuenesse of sin,</span> but where sin is? Their reason therfore (if it bear weight) proues not onely that man might possibly, but that he must sin necessarily. Which I lay down and apply for­mally thus. That without which the Attributes of Gods ju­stice to punish sinne, and of his mercy to pardon it, had been <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1471"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=11">[Page 17]</a></span> utterly without use towards men, that must necessarily be: but without mans sinning, the attributes of Gods justice to punish, and of his mercy to pardon, had been utterly with­out use towards men: <span class="hi">ergo,</span> man must necessarily sin, by just consequence upon their antecedent.</p><p>Their reasons thus answered, I will plainly proue that God could, if it had so pleased him, haue kept <span class="hi">Adam</span> un­changeably good; as the Angels, and soules of men are, and bodies shall be (at the resurrection) unchangeably im­mortall.</p><p>And first, the Scriptures teach us to giue this honour to the power of God, as to beleeue, that <span class="hi">our God in the heaven</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note38">Psal. 115. 4.</span> <span class="hi">doth</span> (and therefore can doe) <span class="hi">whatsoever pleaseth him:</span> and so could (had it pleased him, and been his will) haue preser­ved <span class="hi">Adam</span> from sinning against him. Of their distinction of <span class="hi">Gods will</span> we shall speak by and by. If in the mean while they except, that God could not so will; I would know the reason of their such presumption. If they say, there are some things which God cannot doe, as <span class="hi">to lie,</span> to <span class="hi">deny himselfe,</span> to make the same thing to be, and not to be, at the same time, and the like, inferring either impotence in the Creatour, or contradiction in the creature. I demand, what had there been herein against the nature either of the Creator, or crea­ture, if God by his grace, had kept the understanding of <span class="hi">Adam</span> from being overclowded with errour, or false opini­on, and therewith his will and affections in the integrity of obedience? This had not been (as some imagine) to destroy; but to perfect his nature. Hath not God so kept the <span class="hi">elect Angels</span> without all change from their primitiue purity? Was not the Lord Iesus in his Manhood so kept upon earth? And shall not all the elect be so kept for ever in heaven? These are, were, and shall be unchangeably righteous; and yet were not, nor are, nor shall be <span class="hi">made Gods.</span></p><p>They themselues confesse, that the <span class="hi">devils are unchangeable</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note39">Pag. 11.</span> <span class="hi">in evill;</span> And why then might not both Angels and men be unchangeable in good? that is, so kept by the power of God <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1542"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=12">[Page 18]</a></span> as they never turn from their goodnes. Or what barre would these men haue put against the power of God, if his will had been so to haue preserved and kept <span class="hi">Adam?</span> I demand, whe­ther the Apostles, in their time, could possibly preach any thing but the truth, being immediately and infallibly guided by the Holy Ghost? All these instances serue to proue, that it is possible to God, if it please him, so to assist and confirm by his Spirit, a reasonable creature (though of a changeable nature in its selfe) as that in regard of the same divine assistance, it is not possible it should be changed from good to evill, or sin against God. Lastly, if God could not haue so made and ordered <span class="hi">Adam,</span> as that he could not haue sin­ned, then God did not so much as suffer him to sinne, seeing none can be said properly to suffer a thing to be done, saue he that could hinder it, if he would. It were absurdly said, that I suffer the wind to blow, or sea to swell, though I hinder them not, seeing it is not in my power to hinder them.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.13"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.13. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>THey add from <span class="hi">Ezech. 18, &amp; 33,</span> Gods asseveration, that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note40">Pag. 11. 12</span> <span class="hi">as he liues, he would haue no man transgresse, and so come un­der the exequution of his justice:</span> making withall, <span class="hi">a short descrip­tion of the will of God,</span> as they call it: and ever confounding these two things; <span class="hi">necessity</span> and <span class="hi">compulsion:</span> and <span class="hi">Gods not decree­ing,</span> with his <span class="hi">forcing men to sinne,</span></p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.14"><h3><span class="headingNumber">1.14. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>FOr better answering, and understanding of the answer un­to these things, it must be considered; first, that <span class="hi">the will of God,</span> though simple, and one in its nature, yet exerciseth it selfe diversly, in regard of divers objects. The first and weakest degree of Gods willing (to speak of God as man is able to conceiu of him) is that by which he wills the permis­sion or suffering of sin, as sin. For if God suffer it, he suffers it willingly, seeing he both takes knowledge of it, and could hinder it by his omnipotent power, if he pleased. The <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1603"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=12">[Page 19]</a></span> second degree of Gods willing, is that by which he commands a thing to be done, and approues of it, if it be done. The third and last degree is, that according to which he workes all things by his omnipotent power. And if a man whose will is finite, yet can will things according to those degrees; how much more both possible and easie is it to Gods infinite will, to exercise it selfe more intensly or remisly, according to those degrees? I may be willing, in cases, to suffer that in another which I approue not of: so may I command my servant or child to doe a thing, and approu of it, if it be done, and yet not so will it, as to use all the power that possibly I can, to haue it done. Some things, again, there are that I so will, as that I doe, or am bound to use all my possible skill and power to haue them effected. These things are much more rightly said of God, considering the infinite largenesse of his will, compared with my straitnesse. The same may be said of the Spirit of God which is one (for <span class="hi">there is one Spirit</span>) whose<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note41">1 Cor. 12. 4.</span> operation yet is divers, and the same sometimes more, and sometimes lesse forcible: as we see in the knowledge of an Apostle, compared with the knowledge of an ordinary Mi­nister or Christ<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>an; and many other waies.</p><p>And these differences of the will of God in the exercising of itselfe towards the creature, I desire the Reader here care­fully<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note42">Pag. 12.</span> to obseru for after use. Their <span class="hi">short definition,</span> as they unskilfully call it, <span class="hi">of Gods will,</span> by which <span class="hi">he either wils what man is to doe,</span> or <span class="hi">what he will doe in himselfe,</span> is short indeed, as cutting off all that God will doe and doth out of himselfe, and in the creature, as are all his workes <span class="hi">ad extra,</span> as they are called.</p><p>It remaines, that in the next place, we shew the difference between <span class="hi">necessity</span> and <span class="hi">compulsion;</span> and <span class="hi">Gods decreeing</span> in our sense, and his <span class="hi">forcing of things,</span> (which our Adversaries with great errour confound as the same) and withall, that things may, after a sort, be done necessarily, and freely too. Freely, yea contingently also, in regard of men, and necessarily in regard of Gods work of providence according to his decree. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1655"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=13">[Page 20]</a></span> I mention Gods work according to his decree; because to speak properly, Gods decree or will, works not things, but his power according to his will. There is indeed a <span class="hi">necessity</span> which takes away <span class="hi">freedom</span> and voluntarinesse from men; but then they rather suffer then doe. For example, the striking or thrusting of a man with such violence, as that he is compel­led thereby to stagger or fall: this necessity of compulsion depriues me of all freedom to this bodily motion, so as I stagger or fall unwillingly; but this comes from an externall principle or beginning working violently, and from without me. But this is nothing to that other necessity in regard of God, causing and effecting the good, in and by the creature, according to its kinde; and suffering and ordering the evill person and thing, according to its kind; with which mans freedom may well stand.</p><p>And first, whatsoever God doth, he doth it both most freely, and most necessarily well.

On the contrary, the devils doe evill, both most necessarily (being by these mens own grant, <span class="hi">unchangeably evill</span>) and yet most willingly, as carryed there­unto withall their power.

What hinders then, but that the same thing may in regard of man as the particular and immediate cause, be voluntary and contingent; and yet in regard of God the highest and ge­nerall cause, necessary?

Secondly, for sinne, who was ever so wicked as to imagine that God takes pleasure in it? It pleaseth him for his holy ends, to suffer sin, and to order the creature sinning by his own freewill, &amp; election of evil, as hath been formerly proved.

In the former respect, &amp; materially, as we speak, they are of God and created nature; in the latter and formal­ly, of mans proper corruption. Now the sinne is not the na­turall action of motion, but the pravity and abuse of the action. <span class="hi">The subtilty of our riddle,</span> they, as if they had <span class="hi">plowed with our heyfer,</span> find out to be <span class="hi">this,</span> that in our account <span class="hi">sinne is nothing,</span> and that <span class="hi">God, though the authour of all things, is not the authour of sin, for sin is nothing;</span> and so <span class="hi">the thiefe,</span> and other malefactors, is <span class="hi">punished for nothing by the Iudge:</span> and the <span class="hi">wicked for nothing in everlasting fire.</span></p><p>First, I demand of these men, whether, if God command something to be done, and men doe it not, they deseru not to be punished for their doing of nothing? Is it not sinne not to doe that wee should doe; and to doe nothing when we should doe something? These witty men could teach <span class="hi">the goats <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t Christs left hand,</span> at that day, to answer him<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note54">Matth. 25.</span> to the full, that bee condemned them to hell fire for nothing; for not to doe is to doe nothing. We then answer, first, that we call not sin <span class="hi">nothing</span> negatiuely, but privatiuely, as a want of that which should be; secondly, that sin is not nothing morally, that is not <span class="hi">nothing</span> against Gods Law, for sin onely is <span class="hi">something</span> against it, but <span class="hi">nothing</span> naturally; that is, <span class="hi">nothing</span> which hath a created being in nature.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=15">[Page 24]</a></span>So, for their next Argument, that <span class="hi">by authority of Scripture,</span> &amp; our <span class="hi">own description, sin is a thought, word or deed, contrary to the will of God,</span> and <span class="hi">therefore</span> that <span class="hi">the deed is sin;</span> they should consi­der, that neither the Scriptures nor writers meaning is, that th<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> sin stands not in the naturall deed or motion, but in the <span class="hi">con­trariety</span> which the same deed▪ or motion hath in it to the law of God. Darknes, or a shadow, are nothing positiuely, but onely the want of light. The <span class="hi">voydnes, darknes, and unformed­nes on the earth and deep, in the beginning,</span> were nothing that had<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note55">Gen. 1. 1. 2.</span> reall being; but onely the want of that form, furniture, and light, which God afterward made, and furnished them with­all. When the candle is put out, and it becomes dark; shall we think that any reall thing comes into the house, and causes the darknes? or when I make a shadow by standing in the light, or Sun-shine; do I put any reall thing in the place where the shadow is? or do I not onely keep the light and Sun-shine from it? Likewise, when a man or beast halts in going, shall we imagine that the halting is the very motion of going, or the fault of the motion onely? So is sin onely the absence &amp; want of that conformity and agreeablenesse which ought to be in the thought▪ word, or work of the reasonable creature to the Law of God; which as none of understan­ding and sincerity will deny; so for further satisfaction of the doubting, and conviction of the refractory, I will annex cer­tain most plain and undoubted proofes of Scripture to con­firme the same.</p><p>First, the Apostle quoting and confirming the saying of the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note56"><span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>. 17. 28</span> heathen Poet, witnesseth to the <span class="hi">Athenians,</span> that <span class="hi">in God we liue and moue, and haue our being.</span> Our <span class="hi">being</span> then, that is, our souls and bodies, and our <span class="hi">life</span> arising from their union; and so our <span class="hi">motions</span> arising from our life we haue of God; yea which is more, after a sort, <span class="hi">in him,</span> who filleth all things with his pre­sence. Where let it also be noted, that he speakes of the <span class="hi">being, life, and motions</span> of the very prophane and heathenish Idolaters, as well as of any others.</p><p>Secondly, <span class="hi">God,</span> as it is in the Psalm, <span class="hi">made the heavens and</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note57"><span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>. 146. 6▪</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2098"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=15">[Page 25]</a></span> <span class="hi">earth, and sea, and all that in them is.</span> If sin then be any thing, (viz. any thing having being) God made it, and so it is his creature. And surely if it haue a being, it is either a created or uncreated being. Not the latter, for that is onely God; and therefore the former by their ground. If God created all things that are, sin if it be in their sense, must be Gods crea­ture.</p><p>Thirdly, the same naturall motion of man in which great sin is committed, if it were exercised upon another object, might be without sin, and lawfull; and therefore not the very action or motion, but the misapplying of it, is the sin; from which the action hath its morall, but not its naturall being. For example; the very same naturall motion which <span class="hi">Adam</span> used in takeing and eating the forbidden fruit, upon any o­ther fruit, had been no sin. The same naturall act in which <span class="hi">David</span> practised adultery with <span class="hi">Bethsaba,</span> with his lawfull wife, had been no adultery: the very same naturall act and motion whereby <span class="hi">Ioab</span> killed <span class="hi">Abner,</span> and <span class="hi">Amasa,</span> if exercised upon a malefactor at the magistrates command, had been no murther, but a work of iust execution. The sinne therefore is not in the very act, but in the misapplying it, or other vitious ad­junct.</p><p>Fourthly, considering that there is no sin <span class="hi">in deed</span> or action of body, which was not first in the faculties of the soule, the understanding, will and affections: (for onely <span class="hi">the things</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note58">Mat. 15. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> <span class="hi">which come from the heart, desile the man</span>) the outward sin in fact and deed can no more more make the outward action in itselfe not to be of God; then the inward corruption can make the created faculties in which it is, not to be of God. It is sencelesse to doubt but that when a wicked man sleepeth, and so practiseth no wickednesse one way or other, he is notwithstanding a wicked man. And where now resteth his wickednesse, but in his heart? And what is his heart but the faculties of his understanding, will and affections, which sin possesseth and corrupteth? And yet nevertheles these na­turall faculties remain Gods good creatures; so do their mo­tions <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e2154"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=16">[Page 26]</a></span> naturall, notwithstanding sins possessing them. There is in our sinfull nature, the faculty, and the sin or disorder in it: and in our sinfull works, the action from the faculty, and the outward sinne in it, from the inward sinne in the other.</p><p>Lastly, I thus argue unresistably: That which God blesseth is good, and of himselfe: This none will deny. I assume. But God blesseth the natural action, or motion, in which hor­rible sin is practised. This is most evident (amongst a thou­sand daily instances) in the sinfull commixture of <span class="hi">Iudas</span> and <span class="hi">Thamar,</span> being on his part whoredom, and on hers incest,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note59">Gen. 38.</span> though with a better minde: Yet this action (considered na­turally) God blessed with a childe; yea, with two sonnes; yea, with him, on whom Christ came according to the flesh, who is blessed for ever. Here is plainly the action blessed, and therfore good (in our sense) and of God; and yet the sin in the action, evill and accursed.</p><p>The meaning of Mr. <span class="hi">Knox,</span> in saying, that <span class="hi">what Ethnicks</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note60">Pag. 14, 15▪ 17.</span> <span class="hi">ascribe to fortune, we acknowledg to come from God, as the appoin­ter of the things,</span> they mistake and pervert, neither under­standing the Ethnicks meaning, nor his. The Heathens speak­ing of <span class="hi">fortune</span> did not conceiu that there was any such divine power causing things to be, but the contrary, and that things come to passe without any divine Providence ordering them, and meerly by blinde chance or fortune: when they spake of good fortune, or ill fortune, they meant onely the good or ill hap of persons, or things. His and our meaning then is, that which Christ our Lord also teacheth, that <span class="hi">Not a spar­row</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note61">Ma<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 11. 29</span> <span class="hi">falls to the ground without Gods providence.</span> And where hee speaks of <span class="hi">God as the Authour, by his counsell appointing all things to the one part, and to the other;</span> it is plain hee intends it onely of the ordering and governing of them, which they that deny, doe in effect, pluck God out of heaven, by deny­ing his Soveraignty, and power over all his creatures in orde­ring them, and all their actions, to his own supernaturall ends.

And whence then was it, that these things came not so to passe, and had not their answerable events? Even from the decree and providence of Gods ordering things the other way inevitably. In the for­mer instance we haue Christs own testimony, who, after men­tion of his such <span class="hi">praying, if he would,</span> v. 53, adds v. 54, <span class="hi">But then how shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span> As if he should haue sayd, it agrees well with the interest which I haue in my Fathers loue, that I should obtain from him an invincible Army of heavenly Souldiers for the reskuing of me out of mine enemies hands: but the Scriptures (manifesting the purpose and decree of God) haue foretold the contrary; and that I should thus be <span class="hi">oppressed, and afflicted, and made an</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note67">Esay 53. 7▪ 10.</span> <span class="hi">offering for sin:</span> which before he also professed to be <span class="hi">the will of his Father,</span> v. 39. 42.

These men should haue said thus, that God, alwaies fore-seeing, and sometimes fore-telling, what in regard of the nature of the things might be, and in respect of the disposition of the persons would be, if they were not prevented; yet doth pre­vent them effectually by the work of his providence interpo­sed, according to the decree of his will. And this, so farre as it looks towards the thing in hand, makes against them, avow­ing a most powerfull work of Gods providence, according to a most constant will, over-ruling all dispositions of persons, and events of things.

More plainly yet. We reade, how upon the death of <span class="hi">Absolom, Ahimaz the Priest</span> being very desirous<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note86">2 Sam. 18▪ 22. 23.</span> to be the messenger therof to <span class="hi">David,</span> importunes <span class="hi">Ioab</span> greatly <span class="hi">to let him run,</span> and again to <span class="hi">let him run.

He suffered him, as having a desire of himselfe; and sent him also, as his messenger to the King. So Christ both <span class="hi">suffered</span> the devils, as desiring to possesse the swine rather then to be cast into the deep; and also <span class="hi">sent</span> them, as ordering their malice to that object, and none other, for the tryall of the <span class="hi">Gergesenes.</span></p><p>In the next place, followeth to be considered of, the <span class="hi">send­ing of Ioseph into Aegypt,</span> touching which, let these two things onely be added to the things spoken, for the opening of the former instances. First, that <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> expresly saith, not onely that <span class="hi">God sent him into Aegipt,</span> but that he <span class="hi">sent him thither to</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note87">Gen. 45. 5. 7. 8.</span> <span class="hi">preserue life,</span> which was Gods end, and not his brethrens, and therfore depends upon Gods work, not upon theirs: but withall, that <span class="hi">it was not they that sent him thither, but God. Io­seph</span> here makes God (in a respect) a greater doer then his brethren: these men shut God quite out, and makes him onely a sufferer, or one that left others alone, and meddles not <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3211"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=22">[Page 38]</a></span> with them. His brethren <span class="hi">sold</span> him, but God <span class="hi">sent</span> him; that is, used their envious injury to his own gracious work, both towards him and them, and much other people, whom by his meanes he kept aliue. Secondly, and for conclusion, let this be observed, that <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> speaks of <span class="hi">Gods sending</span> him, to comfort his brethren in their sorrow and fear, for the evill they had done to him. But I would know, what comfort it could be to their perplexed hearts, to think, that God suffe­red them to doe wickedly, that is, hindred them not? Can any man having grace, yea common sense, take comfort in this, that God leavs him to himselfe to doe wickedly, and hinders him not? A miserable comforter would this misera­ble exposition haue made <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> to haue been.

Neither is our <span class="hi">putting on of Christ by faith and obedience,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note115">Ephes. 1. 4.</span> <span class="hi">our election;</span> as they unskilfully make it. Election is Gods work, not ours; for it is God that clruseth us, and not we our selues: but the putting on of Christ by faith and obedience, is our work by Gods grace, and not Gods. God doth not be­leeve and obey, but we by his grace.</p><p>Now before we come to refute their opinion about <span class="hi">Electi­on,</span> hereafter layd down more plainly, but here more confu­sedly, with certain scriptures, rather heaped together then orderly brought for their purpose; it is expedient we exa­mine a distinction brought by them of this divine <span class="hi">Election,</span> by occasion of an objection from Ephes. 1. 4. which is, that <span class="hi">ele­ction is either in the decree or purpose of God</span> onely; <span class="hi">or else effectual­ly</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note116">Pag. 42. 43</span> <span class="hi">and particularly</span> made, as they speak. This distinct on in a good sense (but not in theirs) is good and true. For God e­lects men before the world, or before they be, in his decree and purpose onely. But it must withall be considered, that this election is also (in Gods purpose) actuall and particular be­fore the world. Nothing in God is potentiall, b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t all actuall. Otherwise there should be imperfection in God, as all poten­tials are, being to be perfected by their actualities. They should therefore say, that Gods election of some particulars, was onely in his decree before the world, and is by him in time brought into actuall execution. And here also it must be minded, that whereas all the question (in effect) amongst all, is about <span class="hi">election</span> as <span class="hi">before the world,</span> and in Gods eternall decree: they (in effect) passe that wholly by, and onely treat of it, as God in time puts that in decree in actuall exe­cution.</p><p>Now though their <span class="hi">reasoning of election</span> here be full of con­fusion and contradiction, as any judicious Reader may see, <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>d such as out of which their meaning can hardly be picke<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4097"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=27">[Page 49]</a></span> yet this is plain, that they will haue it to <span class="hi">depend upon the condi­tion of faith and repentance</span> going before, affirming expresly, that <span class="hi">those persons in whom God findeth faith and obedience, them he ele­cteth to salvation in his son, of meer mercie, for the quality which he findeth in them.</span> But now wherein this election properly stands, they neither shew us, nor understand themselues, as is plain by their crosse and unconstant assertions of and about it; wherein yet they are so peremptory and bold, as if they car­ried all by plain demonstration of undoubted truth. What course then are we to hold with them? Considering it is with them as <span class="hi">Salomon</span> speaks of the harlot, who was <span class="hi">lowd and stub­born,</span> whose <span class="hi">feet aboad not in the house,</span> but <span class="hi">she was now without,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note117">Prov. 7.</span> <span class="hi">now in the streets, and laying wayt in every corner.</span> I haue no o­ther way but to pursue them into, and hunt them out of eve­ry corner, where they lye in wayt to deceive.</p><p>First then for Math. 22. <span class="hi">Many are called, but few chosen,</span> It must be noted, that there are three degrees of mens calling to Christ. The first, when the Gospel is preached, but the so called <span class="hi">refuse</span> wholly to answer &amp; come: so were the first <span class="hi">guests</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note118">Vers. 3.</span> called. The second is, when men are perswaded to come after a maner, and in some shew, but without truth of faith and re­pentance; and so he came who <span class="hi">wanted the wedding garment.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note119">Vers. 11.</span> The third is, when men come in true faith and obedience, as they ought; and so the rest of the guests came. Of this third and last degree of calling the Apostle speakes, saying, <span class="hi">Whom</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note120">Rom. 8. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> <span class="hi">he predestinated them also he called; whom he called, them also he justified; and whom he justified them also he glorified.</span> This cannot be sayd of either of the two former sorts of <span class="hi">called,</span> but of the latter onely.</p><p>And for the <span class="hi">Election</span> here spoken of, it may well be under­stood of the eternall election in Gods decree; the fruits and wholsome effects whereof this unprepared guest shews him­self not to be made partaker of, though he participated of the outward calling, even to the making of some shew of that which in truth he wanted. And as the Apostle affirms of the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note121">Eph. 1. 3. 4. 5. 13.</span> Ephesians, that they were <span class="hi">elect of God in Christ before the foun­dation</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4198"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=28">[Page 50]</a></span> <span class="hi">of the world,</span> in regard of the faith and holines appearing in them: so might the Lord well say of this, and other (his like) hypocrites, and unsanctified ones; that they are not of the number of the elect, or chosen in Gods eternall decree, so far as their present state manifests. Neither is it the meaning of the Lord in those words simply to reprove him for not ha­ving on a wedding garment; but for coming thither and not having it on. <span class="hi">Friend, how comest thou hither, not having on a</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note122">Math. 22. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 12.</span> <span class="hi">wedding garment?</span> and so to warn others to <span class="hi">make sure their e­lection,</span> and not to content themselues with the shew of obe­dience, without inward truth.

Gods actuall chusing therfore goes before our actuall faith, holinesse, repentance, and obedience, as the cause; and fol­lows them not, as an effect, as they mis-judge. The same is confirmed from <span class="hi">v.</span> 5, where we are said to <span class="hi">be predestinated to</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note126">Vers. 5.</span> <span class="hi">the adoption of children by Iesus Christ:</span> With which joyne that, Rom. 8. 30, <span class="hi">Whom he predestinated, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he justified, and whom he justified, them also he glorified.</span> To be elected, to wit, in decree, and to be predestinated (in the good part, as here) are the same in sub­stance: onely, we are said to be predestinated in respect of the supernaturall ends, (and means leading therunto) unto which God in time bringeth us; and to be elect, or chosen in respect of others, from whom God selecteth us. Now, if we be predestinated of Christ to the adoption of children, then not because we are children or beleev, which are the same, <span class="hi">Ioh.</span> 1. 12. To this purpose it is, that the Lord so oft by <span class="hi">Moses</span> beats upon this, that he chose the Israelits to be his people, out of his <span class="hi">loue</span> to them, and <span class="hi">loue</span> and <span class="hi">promise to their</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note127">Deut. 4. 35. ch. 7. 7. 8, ch. 14. 2.</span> <span class="hi">Fathers:</span> excluding all other motiues, and placing the cause of his chusing them in himselfe alone, and his loue, and the sta­bility of his purpose and promise. <span class="hi">Moses</span> testifyeth, that <span class="hi">God chose them that they might be a holy and peculiar people unto the Lord:</span> But these men will make God begin at the other end, and chuse men because they are an holy and peculiar people, that is, having <span class="hi">faith, and repentance going before.</span></p><p>Ioyn we with this, that in the Psalm: <span class="hi">Blessed</span> be the man <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4366"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=29">[Page 52]</a></span> <span class="hi">whom thou chusest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note128">Psal. 65. 4.</span> <span class="hi">dwell in thy courts; we shalbe satisfied with the goodnesse of thy house, of thy holy Temple</span> Faith then and holinesse are not the fore found conditions for which God chuseth a man: but the actuall conferring and giving of them, according to an eternall purpose, is the very actuall chusing of him: even that by which God severs, elects, selects, and chuseth him out of the masse of the wicked. Every mans common sense will teach this. All are of themselues, and by nature, sinners, and subject to wrath. Now what is it for God actually to chuse some from the rest, but to bestow that upon them actually and effectually, by which they differ actually from the rest, which is faith and repentance. God doth not therfore (as these ad­versaries imagine) <span class="hi">chuse, upon condition of faith and repentance going before:</span> but doth, by the very bestowing of these graces of faith and repentance, which others want, chuse, elect, se­lect and sever actually from others, the elected from eternity in his decree.</p><p>Lastly, by the crosse doctrine of these men, we should chuse God, before God chuse us; for by beleeving and obey­ing, we chuse God to be our God; and for this (by their crooked rule) God after chuseth us to be his people.

But con­sider we this choise in proportion to the other, and see what followeth. Gods actuall chusing of <span class="hi">David</span> to the Kingdom of Israel, was that by which he had first actuall right to that Kingdom, to which he had right before, onely in Gods de­cree, and of which afterwards he had possession. So Gods actuall chusing of a man to the Kingdom of heaven, is that by which he hath first actuall right to that Kingdom, to which he had no right before, saue in Gods decree. Gods chusing a man therfore actually (as they speak) to the Kingdom of heaven, is the very giving of him faith and holinesse; for by these he hath this actuall right to eternall life and glory. If therfore Gods chusing men actually (opposed to his chu­sing them in decree) be his giving them actuall faith and re­pentance, then their faith and repentance goes not before Gods choise, but on the contrary, his chusing before their beleeving. The giving of the grace by God, must needs goe before the having of it by men.</p><p>With like successe, they quote, <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 9. 25, and <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Pet.</span> 2. 10▪ &amp;c. which haue no shew of ground, whereon to build their assertion, that God chuseth men actually and particularly be­cause they beleev and repent: but most firm foundation for the contrary truth; Men become Gods people, and beloved actually, by actuall faith and repentance: which before were his, and beloved onely, in <span class="hi">the purpose</span> of his will, <span class="hi">according to election,</span> Rom. 9. 11. 13, and <span class="hi">elect, according to Gods foreknow­ledge,</span> 1 Pet. 1. 2, God therefore actually chusing men, and making them his people, and beloved (which are all one) by<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note131">Ephes. 2. 8▪ 2 Tim. 2. 2<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> giving them to beleev and repent: their beleeving and repen­ting cannot goe before his chusing them, but the con­trary.

The Apostle saith, we obtain the righteousnesse of faith, which is the wedding garment, according to the election of grace: They say, we obtain the election of grace according to the wedding garment, and righteousnesse of faith and obe­dience. The Apostle saith, the election obtains the righteous­nesse of Christ by faith: they say, the righteousnes of Christ by faith, obtains the election: turning Gods work upside down, that they may establish their own. Besides this proud exalta­tion, and Babylonish building of mens works against Gods grace (for if it be of obedience, as they say, then of works, to wit, the works of obedience) the Apostle v. 6, clean over­turns, saying. <span class="hi">If by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwise grace is no more grace: but if it be of works, then it is no more grace, otherwise works is no more works.</span></p><p>In alledging from 2 <span class="hi">Pet.</span> 1. 10, that <span class="hi">this election must be made sure,</span> they, as before, craftily conceal part of the Apostles words, which being laid down, as the Text hath them, over­throw plainly their errour.

But then they must needs rush upon the same deperate rock, with the other; which is, that none are thus actually and particularly elect or chosen, till they be dead, seeing they deny all certainty of perseverance, to the living; not acknowledging any thus elect, either before the world, or in it, but after the world, and in heaven.</p><p>The Scriptures here produced to proue that men are not<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note140">Pag. 41. 42 43. 44.</span> <span class="hi">actually, really, and particularly Gods people, and partakers of the grace of Christ before the world,</span> and <span class="hi">they</span> also be, and <span class="hi">before they haue learned Christ,</span> might well haue been spared, as proving that onely which no man doubts of.

He that takes all alike, chuseth none. Besides, by this, the same persons are both elected and reprobated, chosen, and refused: and every one alike either of both. Then which nothing is more absurd. The insinuation is, that we make <span class="hi">God an accepter of persons,</span> in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note141">Pag. 43. 44</span> saying, that he <span class="hi">chuseth men that haue not put on Christ.</span> Nothing lesse.

This is the highest cause that God would haue us take knowledge of; though wee also know in the generall, that God is no way wilfull in his will, though hee be most free, but alwaies most wise and holy. To remoue a little further out of the way this stone, at which divers stum­ble.</p><p>First, we know, that all by nature, and of themselvs, are subject to sin, and condemnation, and so might in justice haue been left of God, without remedy of redemption. If then it had been but just with God to haue left all in that state of sin and misery, into which they haue cast themselvs, it is then meere mercy, that he hath chosen any in his Son, or given him for any. Now if of all men, indefinitely considered as faln. God haue purposed in himself from eternity, to raise up some, by working effectually in them faith and obedience, so to saue them; and not to work the same in others, but to leav them to their own affected and effected pravity, and sin, and so in justice to condemn them for that their wickedness by them freely committed, and obstinately continued in; I would know, in regard of whether of these two works we can be said to make God, <span class="hi">a respecter of persons?</span> The one being a pure work of his mercy, and the other of his justice. Why God should thus chuse some, and passe by others, in the generall, we see reason, both by the light of nature, and the Scriptures; namely, that the <span class="hi">glory</span> of his <span class="hi">power,</span> and justice <span class="hi">might be seen</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note143">Rom. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 21. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>2. 23.</span> in the one, and of <span class="hi">the riches of his mercy</span> in the other. But why in particular, the Lord God should rather chuse this man, or woman, then that, we leav unto himselfe to know, till the day of revelation of hidden things. Onely, let our care and diligence be in the mean while, first, to know assu­redly, that we are our selvs of that blessed number, and by such marks, as cannot deceiv; and so knowing, both to haue in our hearts, and to expresse in word and deed all thankful­nes unto our good God, and most gracious Father, who hath vouchsafed unto us, aboue many others, such singular mercy.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.5"><div class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4916"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=32">[Page 59]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.5. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>IT now remains, we come to examine, whether (to use their<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note144">Pag. 44.</span> own words) <span class="hi">the wicked that come to damnation, had by this purpose of God</span> (spoken of before) <span class="hi">means of salvation, if they had not refused it.</span></p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.6"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.6. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>FIrst, if this of outward means were granted them, it would not help them to proue <span class="hi">the purpose of God to saue all;</span> ex­cept they could also proue, that there needed nothing on Gods part, but the outward means.

Christ therefore dyed effectually, and in his, and his fathers intention of love, for them onely that are saved, and perish not. This is also more manifest Ioh. 17. whence may be drawn many arguments to prove that all for whom Christ died, are saved, seeing <span class="hi">all that are given to Christ of the Father, keep the word of God, and haue eternall life gi­ven them by him,</span> Now it cannot be denyed, but that all for whom Christ dyed, are given him of the Father, that he might redeem and save them by his death. Furthermore, the death and bloodshed of Christ is every where called the <span class="hi">price of our redemption,</span> and <span class="hi">a ransome for sinners.</span> Vpon this holy foundation most clearly layd in the Scriptures, these men, and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note159">1 Cor. 6. 20▪ 1 Tim. 2. 6. Mat. 20▪ 25▪ Ephes. 1. 7.</span> others would build a more hatefull <span class="hi">Babell</span> then that of old in the East: by which they would, as it were, scale heaven, and depriue God of divers his most glorious Attributes; by name, his Wisdom, his Power, and his Iustice. His wisdom they <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>m­peach in affirming, that he would buy with so rich &amp; precious a price as the bloud and death of his onely begotten Son, that, and them whom he certainly knew before, he should never possesse by it, for that end, for which he bought them, their justification, sanctification, and salvation. Secondly it impea­cheth Gods power, and makes him unable, doe he what he can, to save any more then he doth save, though he desire it never so much. For look, for whom he would do the greatest thing that possibly he could, which was the giving of his onely begotten and beloved Sonne to the cursed death of the crosse, for them and their salvation (without all doubt) hee he will doe whatseever other good (as lesse) that possibly he can. Whereupon it should follow that God cannot possibly give the Gospell to more then he doth, and by it convert and confirm them to and in his grace, which are lesse things then the former; it being the foundation, they, but the buil­ding <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5479"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=35">[Page 65]</a></span> upon it: it being the meritorious, and deserving cause<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> and they effects thereof. Thirdly, this conceit makes God unjust, in taking a full price and ransom for mens sins, at the hands of their surety Christ (as was his death and obedience) and yet not resting satisfied with it, but exacting the debt of their sinnes at their hands, by eternall punishment; which is the condition of many thousands in the world.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.9"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.9. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>OTher things follow, tending to prove <span class="hi">Gods purpose to save</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note160">Pag. 45.</span> <span class="hi">all,</span> even such as <span class="hi">slew Christ, blasphemed and resisted the spirit of God,</span> to their <span class="hi">condemnation,</span> &amp;c.

Now the Apostles not knowing which in particular were elect, and redeemed in the secret purpose of God, and Christ, were to sow the seed of grace upon all grounds, and to preach to all indifferently, as they had occasion; hoping in charity that this, and that, and any one particular, might be of the elect ves­sels, and good ground in Gods destination: by whose <span class="hi">preach­ing</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5527"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=36">[Page 66]</a></span> <span class="hi">such as were preordained to life, beleeved</span> actually.

The places, Math. 28. and Mark. 16. speak also of the time after Christs ascension, and not before, and so over­throw an universall calling of all, at all times: <span class="hi">God shewed his word to Iakob; but dealt not so with any other nation.</span> Besides, their<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note164">Psa. 147. 19 <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>0.</span> meaning is not, that the Apostles should preach to every par­ticular person in the world: for that neither could they possi­bly doe, ne<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ther can they be imagined, without madnesse, to have done it, but to shew, that as God had formerly by the Prophets taught that one nation of the Iewes; so now hee would have all other nations taught, as there was opportu­nity <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5625"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=36">[Page 67]</a></span> and occasion. By that Rom. 10. 18. the Apostle means not, that the Gospell was preached in all ages to every person in the world. He quotes Psal. 19. which speakes apparently of the creatures preaching, specially <span class="hi">the heavens and firmament,</span> which the Holy Ghost here applieth to the Apostles preach­ing in their age, either by way of argument, or allusion. And yet even this very Apostle in this Epistle, shews that then there were places, where <span class="hi">Christ was not named, nor spoken of,</span> and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note165">Rom. 15. 20. 21.</span> wheremen <span class="hi">had not heard of him.</span></p><p>To the other places brought, the former answers suffice. Where it is sayd, <span class="hi">the Gospel is now preached to all nations,</span> and <span class="hi">through the whole world,</span> ▪ and <span class="hi">to every creature,</span> and the like, first, the note of distinction <span class="hi">now,</span> is to be minded, intimating, that before <span class="hi">now</span> the Gospel was not preached to nations, but to that one nation of the Iewes onely. Secondly we are not to imagine, that by <span class="hi">all nations,</span> and the like, is meant eve­ry particular nation without exception, much lesse, every par­ticular person in every nation, but to take the words as inde­finitely spoken (as opposed to the preaching to that one na­tion) as there was occasion for the Apostles or other reachers to come unto them. Where it is sayd, Act. 2. 5. that <span class="hi">there were dwelling in Ierusalem devout men out of every nation under hea­ven,</span> shall we imagine that there must needs be <span class="hi">English</span> and <span class="hi">I­rish,</span> and <span class="hi">Iappanians</span> there? The particular enumeration of many, v. 9. 10. 11. shewes what is meant by <span class="hi">all.</span> When the <span class="hi">Iewes of▪ Asia,</span> Act. 21. 28. accused <span class="hi">Paul</span> to <span class="hi">teach all men every where against the people, and Law, and holy place,</span> shall we be so senselesse as to think their meaning to have been, that he so taught every particular person in the world? What is it, if this be not, for the <span class="hi">unlearned and unstable to pervert the Scriptures to their own destruction?</span></p><p>Lastly, their passionate out-cry against our <span class="hi">doctrine,</span> as <span class="hi">blas­phemy, and as making God to dissemble in all these his sayings,</span> as having <span class="hi">left the greatest number in sin, without reconciliation, because</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note166">Pag. 46. 47▪</span> <span class="hi">he would have them damned,</span> is to be taken as a fit of their ra­ving, by reason of that spiritual burning feaver which posses­seth <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5737"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=37">[Page 68]</a></span> and distempereth their hearts, and brains, and whole man. We doe not say that God doth any thing at all either tend­ing to, or in the condemnation of men, because he would have them damned, but that he performs all his most just, though fearfull works about Reprobates, <span class="hi">to shew his wrath, and make his power known</span> against sin and sinners to the glory<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note167">Rom. 9. 22.</span> of his Iustice, in their deserved condemnation. Which his <span class="hi">un­searchable iudgements and works,</span> we do not furiously oppugne, as these their, and our adversaries doe, but admire with fear and trembling, as we are taught by the Apostles exclamation, <span class="hi">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note168">Rom. 11. 33▪</span> <span class="hi">how unsearchable are his iudgments, and his wayes past finding outs</span> And what if the holy &amp; iust God had left all men universally (as having defaced his image in which they were at first created &amp; made) without any means or hope of remedy, as he did <span class="hi">the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note169">2.

And will these male-parts then sue him at the law, if he have held that course of justice towards some, which was due to all? Will they make the grace of the Gospell a debt from God to men, or a matter of meer grace, and mer­cie? Is it not of meer mercie that he calls any to life? and but just if he leave all to themselves, and their own affected ig­norances and lusts? We doe not then impute either dissimu­lation or cruelty to God in any thing which he sayth or doth▪ but deny him to say or do as they dream.</p><p>Vpon the objection here framed in our name, that <span class="hi">there are many which never heard of Christ,</span> we doe not demand as they fondly make us, <span class="hi">how then the Scriptures</span> (cited by them) <span class="hi">are ve­rified?</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note170">Pag. 47.</span> but doe affirme that the same Scriptures are by them perverted against their right meaning. But now, how do they satisfie this objection put into our hands by the Apostle him­selfe, Rom. 15. 20. Do they set themselves, as is meet, to a plain and direct answer? Nothing lesse. But as a crafty guide meaning to deceive his inexpert passenger, leads him by many turnings, and the same perplexed, and hard to find, in which he may easily loose his aym: so doe these deceivers here, and <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5803"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=37">[Page 69]</a></span> in many other places, in stead of giving a direct answer, fetch compasse about, by bringing in by-things, some true, some false, none pertinent, in which the weaker sort of Readers cannot but loose themselves, and forget the force of the Ar­gument brought.

Now what is it for <span class="hi">the Gentiles,</span> to haue <span class="hi">had the Law written in their hearts, in or by nature,</span> as the Apo­stle speaks?

This also the very word <span class="hi">nature</span> imports, signifying that which is born with a man, or with which hee is born; com­ming of a word in Greek that signifies to beget, or produce, as parents doe children, and each living creature its kind: And seeing the Apostle here speaks of a <span class="hi">Law</span> by which men discern the differences between right and wrong; good and evill; ho­nest and dishonest, in morall and main matters; whence, and with what hand, should all, and every man and woman living in the world, even there where is no Law otherwise written or preached, haue this law and conscience thus written in their breasts, saue by the finger of God in creation? This know­ledg and conscience being the remainders of that image of God, in which all men, in <span class="hi">Adam</span> were made. By all which it appears evidently, that infants bring into the world with them this law of nature, and those foot-steps of Gods image in their reasonable soules; who having in them the fa­culties of understanding and will, cannot possible be devoyd of all law for the ordering of the same; to wh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ch <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>aw, they are necessarily either disposed, or indispos<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>d▪ <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> it <span class="gap" title="•••"> [...]</span>not be, that the reasonable faculties of understanding and <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>ll, <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> any of mankind, should be voyd of all vertuous, or vitious <span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>s­position, and inclination at least, to the things of the law of nature, that is of God, the effects whereof they sh<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>w forth actually in their time.

But now what did those Heathens in this case? <span class="hi">They became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were full of darkenesse,</span> so as they <span class="hi">turned the glory of the incorruptible God to Idols: satisfying themselvs in their own inventions:</span> And this also, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6446"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=41">[Page 76]</a></span> as consonant to the Scriptures, we willingly admit of? And what then? <span class="hi">God for this</span> (say they) <span class="hi">delivered them up to a repro­bate minde, that they never knew more:</span> for, <span class="hi">what should he that is not faithfull in a little, be trusted with more? Luk.</span> 16. 10, <span class="hi">and gaue them up to their own hearts lusts,</span> and <span class="hi">so they became past feeling.</span> And to consent with them herein also, the Scriptures leade us very directly. But what now follows of all this for conclusi­on? Namely, that <span class="hi">all Nations, Citties, houses,</span> &amp;c. that is, <span class="hi">eve­ry</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note191">Pag. 57.</span> <span class="hi">particular man, and woman, hath had the mercy of God in the offer of Christ affoarded them; that all were bidden to the marriage.</span> Nay, the plain contrary; and that all were not bidden: but that many in stead of this mercy to be bidden, were in justice left to themselvs, and given up to their own vain imaginations; the Lord <span class="hi">suffering all the Nations to walk in their own waies,</span> as<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note192">Act. 14. 16.</span> the Apostle saith, and <span class="hi">refusing</span> (as themselvs confesse) <span class="hi">to trust them with much, which had not been faithfull in a little,</span> so as <span class="hi">they never knew more.</span> And whereas they cunningly shuffle in, now and then, that <span class="hi">men might haue had Christ given unto them,</span> or <span class="hi">of­fered them,</span> and that <span class="hi">Christ might haue been manifested to every one if they had would</span> (how congruously to the Scriptures they speak therein we now dispute not) is not onely besides the matter in controversie; which is, what was, and is, and not what might haue been done; but to their own prejudice, feeing that which onely might haue been, is not, specially that bar be­ing put by mens own default, which effectually hinders the being of it, as in this case.</p><p>Having thus shewed that these men either fight busily with their own shadows, in proving at large things never called in­to question by us; or may easily haue their weapons turned upon themselvs, in the main matter: I will even now proceed, after that I haue briefly observed some particular mistakings by them. And first, they both add to the Text, and err in ap­plying that which is written, Rom. 11. 32. The Scripture is, <span class="hi">God hath concluded them all in unbeliefe, that he might haue mer­cie upon all,</span> they add, of their own, <span class="hi">every person:</span> whereas the Apostle neither speaks of every person; but onely of the <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6526"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=41">[Page 77]</a></span> Gentiles indefinitely at one time, and of the Iews at another, which he there opposeth the one to the other: neither speaks he of the offering of grace and mercy onely, as they deem; but of the actuall conferring of it upon all, of whom there he speaks, who <span class="hi">beleeved</span> and <span class="hi">obtained mercy;</span> the other remain­ing <span class="hi">in unbeleef.</span> And this, both the drift and words of the place expresly manifest, v. 30. 31. 32. Neither doth that other place alledged, Tit. 2. 11, speak of all, and every particular person, but of persons of all sorts, <span class="hi">servants</span> as well as <span class="hi">masters,</span> or any others. The Apostle v. 9, &amp; 10, provokes beleeving servants to <span class="hi">obedience to their masters;</span> rend<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ing this reason of encouragement, v. 11, <span class="hi">for the grace of God which bringeth salva­tion unto all, hath appeared,</span> as if he should say, that even they, though poor bond-slaves, if they continued in faith, and faithfull obedience, should haue their part in the salvation of God, as well as any others. Secondly, as I will not simply deny, that <span class="hi">God punished the Heathens other sins with the want of preaching Christ unto them;</span> so is it certain, that greater sinners, and deeplyer drowned both in idolatry, and other lusts, none in the world were, then the <span class="hi">Corinthians, Athenians, Ephesians,</span> and others to whom Christ was preached, and faith thereby given to many unto salvation. The Lord tels the Prophet, that <span class="hi">though the house of Israel, to whom he was sent, would not</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note193">Ezech. 3. 6.</span> <span class="hi">hear, yet if he had sent him to the Heathens, surely they would haue heard him:</span> So the Lord Iesus <span class="hi">upbraids the cities of Chorah,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note194">Mat. 11. 2<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> 21. 23.</span> <span class="hi">Bethsaida, and Capernaum,</span> where he both preached, and <span class="hi">wrought most of his mighty works,</span> that they were deeper in the contempt of God, and further from all disposition to use aright the means of salvation, then the Heathenish Cities of <span class="hi">Tyre</span> and <span class="hi">S<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>don,</span> yea, of <span class="hi">Sodom</span> it selfe: unto whom yet he vouchsafed not the means of repentance, and revelation of grace, which he did to the former. By which, it doth appear, that the Lord doth not observ the order prescribed unto him by these men, for the dispensing of his favours this way, in <span class="hi">trusting them with most, who are of their faithfull in a little;</span> (that is, wholly faithlesse indeed;) but <span class="hi">as the wind blows where it lists,</span> so<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note195">Ioh. 3▪</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6618"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=42">[Page 78]</a></span> doth he by the sweet gusts of his Gospell, and <span class="hi">spirit, according</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note196">Mat. 11. 25 Eph. 1. 3. 4. 5.</span> <span class="hi">to the good pleasure of his own will,</span> (and not according to the good pleasure of mens will, in their use of naturall light and conscience) dispense supernaturall grace, both for means, and efficacy. Lastly, as they here contradict their main<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note197">Pag. 57.</span> ground of universall calling, in supposing some <span class="hi">Nation</span> to haue <span class="hi">no means</span> of knowing Christ: so I would learn of them, how <span class="hi">the Gentiles</span> (wholly voyd of faith) <span class="hi">could rightly examine all things,</span> touching the <span class="hi">offence of God,</span> an <span class="hi">accusing conscience,</span> and the <span class="hi">satisfying of Gods justice,</span> as they would haue them: or in so doing, could promise to themselvs <span class="hi">the revelation of Christ by one means or other,</span> as they liberally undertake for them? They tell us, <span class="hi">He that seeks shall find,</span> Math. 7. But we answer them, that Christ there speaks not of a seeking by blind, and unbeleeving Gentiles, but by his faithfull Dis­ciples.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note198">Mat. 5. 1. 2.</span></p><p>Now, albeit the eternall and unchangeable election of God doe not manifest it selfe, in time, in the bare outward calling of the so elected, common to many others with them; but as the same hath joyned with it the effectuall work of true faith and repentance in the heart, peculiar to them alone: Yet seeing these adversaries labour upon presumption of an uni­versall grace offered to all in the preaching of the Gospell, to establish an uniuersall election of all, (that is, in truth, to over­throw all election) I will here annex, to the things formerly laid down, two or three plain testimonies for th<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> further conviction. The first <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>s from the Psalm: <span class="hi">He shewed his word</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note199">Psal. 147. 19. 20.</span> <span class="hi">unto Iacob, his statutes and his judgements unto Israel: He hath not dealt so with any Nation, and as for judgements, they haue not known them.</span> The Heathens therfore (if we will giue credit to the word of God had not the knowledg of Gods word, &amp; so not of the Gospel, which is most hidden, as being of super­natural revelation onely. Of the same Gentiles the Apostle te­stifieth, that <span class="hi">God in times past suffered</span> them <span class="hi">all to walk in their own wayes:</span> that is, did not manifest Christ unto them for faith in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note200">Act. 14. 16 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> his bloud, and repentance through him, but onely his <span class="hi">po­wer</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6713"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=42">[Page 79]</a></span> and <span class="hi">God-head, giving them rain from heaven,</span> and other bo­dily<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note201">Rom. 1.</span> blessings to <span class="hi">witnesse</span> the same. With this accords that els­where: <span class="hi">The times of this ignorance</span> (which had been amongst<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note202">Act. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 3<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> the Gentiles before Christ) <span class="hi">God regarded not,</span> or winked at: <span class="hi">but now commandeth all men every where</span> (as well Gentiles as Iewes) <span class="hi">to repent.</span> The Apostle opposeth the time <span class="hi">now,</span> in which he preached, to the former times: and shews that God <span class="hi">now,</span> and not in times past, called all to repentance by the preaching of the word. To conclude, the same Apostle ex­presly teacheth, that there is <span class="hi">no salvation but by beleeving in the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note203">Rom. 10. 14. 15.</span> <span class="hi">name of the Lord Iesus, by the preaching of the word and Gospell, by preachers sent of God,</span> for that end.

They also erre in make­ing <span class="hi">this one of the places in Pauls Epistles, of which the Apostle Peter speaketh,</span> 2.

This might wel agree with these mens wandrings in this their treatise, but agrees not with the wisdom either divine or humane wherewith the Apostle was furnished. Much more absurd is it to imagine, that having formerly handled that subject matter of justification so plain­ly as he hath done, chap. 3, and 4. he should returne to handle the same matter so darkly and obscurely, as all the adversa­ries to the truth, and fautors of this conceit, are compel­led to confesse he hath done in this place.</p><p>Thirdly, if this were the Apostles proper drift, what nee­ded he to have made such deep protestation of his hearty sor­row for the Iewes as he did, more in this place then in the former, where he handled that matter more clearly then here? It was in truth no other thing that moved the man of God <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6953"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=44">[Page 82]</a></span> to these sad and sorrowfull protestations, then to remov the offence which might be taken at the Iews rejection, and cal­ling of the Gentiles in their stead; of which, and the highest cause thereof, hee was now to speak in the 9. 10. and 11. chapters.</p><p>Lastly, we shall (God willing) make it appear in sundry particulars, that these Adversaries, by wresting of some things, and omitting of others, <span class="hi">pervert the Apostles words</span> to a strange sense, how soever they think to get advantage by striking others first with that imputation.</p><p>And first, though they account it <span class="hi">plain,</span> and <span class="hi">without difficulty,</span> that the Apostles meaning v. 5, &amp; 6, is, that <span class="hi">not all the Israelits, not all the children of Abrahams flesh specially, not such as boa­sted of the observation of the Law, were therefore in the state of sal­vation, or should be saved:</span> yet in truth, he plainly means ano­ther<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note208">Pag. 60.</span> thing; namely, that <span class="hi">all Israel, all that were the seed of Abra­ham,</span> and <span class="hi">children of the flesh,</span> were not that <span class="hi">Israel,</span> that <span class="hi">seed,</span> those <span class="hi">children</span> to whom <span class="hi">the promise was made:</span> that is, were not they touching whom God by his <span class="hi">promise</span> declared his <span class="hi">purpose of election</span> mentioned, v. 11. For though all are saved that re­ceiv the promise by faith, and none by the works of the Law, yet the Apostle in this place, neither speaks a word of salva­tion (as the effect of the promise) but of <span class="hi">election</span> (as the cause therof:) nor yet of mens receiving the promise by faith; but of Gods making it, <span class="hi">according to election;</span> that so <span class="hi">the pur­pose of God,</span> and promise manifesting it, <span class="hi">might stand accord­ing to election,</span> v. 11, that <span class="hi">the word of God might take effect,</span> v. 6. even <span class="hi">the word of promise; At this time will I come</span> &amp;c. v. 9, they are then called <span class="hi">children of the promise,</span> not because they recei­ved, but because the <span class="hi">promise (Sara shall haue a Son,</span> &amp;c.) <span class="hi">was made</span> unto them, <span class="hi">according to the election of grace,</span> and <span class="hi">stableness of Gods purpose,</span> v. 8. 9. 11, which promise also, they did in time, receiv by faith, according to the election of that rem­nant from the rest, the promise following the purpose of election; and faith, and salvation by it following the purpose and promise.

For comparing together two such persons, as whereof the one glories in his own righteousnesse, as perfectly answering to the holinesse and righteousnesse of the Law; justifying himselfe, when the Law condemnes him; despising the grace and mercy of God in Christ offered, and <span class="hi">making him a lyar in not receiving the testimony which he gives of</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note219">1.

And if any should be so senselesse, as to object injustice to God in such a case (as they conceive the objecter to be) yet was not the Apostle so witlesse, as to fly for answer to the absolute will of God, and to plead, that <span class="hi">God will</span> doe so, because he <span class="hi">will</span> or pleaseth to doe it, as v. 15. 18. <span class="hi">I will haue mercie on whom I will have mercie, &amp;c.</span> Which answer of the Apostle also ministers matter of further and more difficult objection, as appeares v. 19. 20.

These men in truth confound all things, setting mans will where<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note221">Pag. 67.</span> Gods should stand. God saith, <span class="hi">on whom I will:</span> they say, on him that himselfe wils, or <span class="hi">seeketh as he ought,</span> &amp;c.

Neither yet doe either of these decrees passe forth from God for themselvs, but both the one, and the other for the glory of his power and justice to be made known to men and Angels, v. 22.

It is his revealed will which requires it; but his secret and unknown will to giue it, till he make it known by giving it. Neither doth the willing and not willing, (no nor nilling, which is more) of the same thing, make two con­trary wils, saue as they crosse one another in the same respect, else they are but divers in respect of divers objects in consi­deration.</p><p>To open this a little further. It was the revealed, or com­manding will of God, that <span class="hi">Pharaoh</span> should <span class="hi">let Israel goe:</span> but so it was not his secret, or working will; that is, God did not so will this, as that he would use his omnipotent power, and doe what he could to bring it to passe. God, who turned<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note232">Gen. 31. Act. 9. Prov. 21. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> the heart of <span class="hi">Laban,</span> persecuting <span class="hi">Iakob,</span> and of <span class="hi">Saul,</span> persecu­ting the Christians; and <span class="hi">in whose hands are the hearts of Kings as the rivers of waters, which hee turneth whethersoever hee wils,</span> could (had it so pleased him) by his irresistable power haue softned <span class="hi">Pharaohs</span> heart towards his people <span class="hi">Israel.</span> It was Gods revealed will (wherewith <span class="hi">Moses</span> acquainted him) that he should let the people goe: his secret will, which he knew not, till he felt the woefull effects of it, to harden his heart for the de­claration of his power in his deserved destruction. So for <span class="hi">Abrahams offering up his son Isaak,</span> it was Gods revealed will,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note233">Gen. 22▪</span> that he should <span class="hi">offer him up for a burnt offering,</span> as is plain, in that he commanded him so to doe, v. 1. 2; yet withall, it was Gods secret will, that he should not offer him, <span class="hi">nor lay his hand upon him, nor doe any thing unto him;</span> as he also revealed unto him in due time, but purposed in himselfe before: <span class="hi">God being without variablenesse, or shadow of turning,</span> and not to be con­ceived<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note234">Iam. 1. 17.</span> to haue changed his mind, as vain man doth; yet were <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8203"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=50">[Page 94]</a></span> not these two wils contrary one to another, but divers, not in God, in whom all things are one (even one God) but in re­spect of divers objects and ends. God willed <span class="hi">Isaaks</span> offering, so far as the commanding will reached, for the tryall of <span class="hi">A­brahams faith and obedience,</span> and this he revealed: But now God would not haue him offered, in regard of the event of the thing: but this as secret for the present, and till God re­vealed it in its time. Neither doe we (or the Apostle whose steps we tread in) by teaching that God <span class="hi">hardens men by a will that cannot be resisted, say</span> (as they ignorantly accuse us and him) <span class="hi">that God compels men to trespass, and so to suffer.</span> There is no com­pulsion of any, but of him that is unwilling: but he that is hardned, is willingly hardned, as well as necessarily. His hardning of himselfe in a course of sin, is as voluntary, as is Gods hardning him by way of punishment, necessary and ir­resistible.</p><p>The Apostle teacheth, how it is <span class="hi">impossible for these who were</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note235">Heb. 6. 4. 5. 6.</span> <span class="hi">once enlightned, &amp; have tasted of the heavenly gift, &amp;c. if they fall away to renue them again to, or by repentance.</span> If it be impossible for them to repent, then they remain impenitent necessarily by Gods just judgment upon them, and yet I suppose, voluntari­ly also, even our adversaries being Iudges. Their impeniten­cy therefore and hardnesse of heart, though in regard of men a sin, and therefore voluntary: it is in regard of God a pu­nishment, and therefore necessary and irresistable, except we will say, that men can resist Gods judgments: and doe that which the Apostle affirmes to be <span class="hi">impossible.</span></p><p>Neither needs this deep and divine mystery of Gods judg­ments trouble any that considers aright of these three things. First, that as the Sun puts no ill savour into the dung-hill, though the stink therof be increased by its shining: so neither doth God add any hardnesse, or impenitency to any, but one­ly leaves unrestrained, occasions, stirrs up, and orders the corruption which he finds in men to this event. Secondly, that man is more willing to be impenitent, and hard-hearted, then God is to have him so. Thirdly, that this, in regard of man is <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8255"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=50">[Page 95]</a></span> a sin: in regard of God, a punishment of former sins.</p><p>The Apostles answer to the objection now followeth, v. 20. <span class="hi">Nay, but O man, who art thou that disputest with God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another to dishonor?</span> Wherein first, he represseth mans insolency, who being but <span class="hi">man,</span> yet dare presume to call <span class="hi">Gods</span> doing into question. 2. He justifies the Lords doing by his absolute power over the creature, as the potter hath power over his clay.</p><p>And by this answer of the Apostle it appeares, how these men mistake his meaning in the question. His answer is not at all of this or that manner of saving men, (as they imagine and maintain) but of the saving of this person rather then that: they being both alike in themselves, and as <span class="hi">the clay of the same lump.</span> If <span class="hi">Pauls</span> answer should be shaped according to their misformed question, then the meaning must be; that the pot­ter might chuse which way he would make a vessell of honor,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note236">Pag. 71. 72▪</span> whether by <span class="hi">the workes of the Law,</span> or by <span class="hi">faith and obedience to the Gospell:</span> and so not of the same lump, but of two contrary lumps: the one <span class="hi">beleeving and obeying;</span> the other, <span class="hi">not turning from hi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> wicked way▪</span> and yet <span class="hi">seeking salvation by his worke<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> The Apostle here plainly pleads the Lords power over the crea­ture, to make him a vessell of honor or dishonor: they plead the Lords power over the means onely, by which he will do this.

But the Apostle here speaks of <span class="hi">Gods making</span> men, <span class="hi">vessels unto dishonor,</span> and not of mens making themselves; and of the potter making the vessell, and not of the vessels making it self thus, or thus. It is plain <span class="hi">Paul</span> grants the objection, that no man can resist Gods will; and yet justifies his complaining, considering his power over his creature to decree, and so to bring unto most contrary estates by just and convenient meanes, persons in themselves alike, and as the clay of one lump, v. 21. 22. 23.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.23"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.23. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>IN the opening of these verses they follow their usuall, but ill custome of carrying the Reader away to other places, and things: and enter upon a tedious discourse upon Ier. 18. <span class="hi">from whence</span> they affirme, <span class="hi">the Apostle hath these words,</span> and so speaks of the same <span class="hi">making of a vessell of dishonor</span> with the pro­phet in that place.</p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2_div.24"><h3><span class="headingNumber">2.24. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>I Deny their peremptory assertion, and require their proof.

The Prophet speaks of the making or marring of one and the same vessell: the Apostle of divers vessels, and the making of one to honour, and another to dishonour.

And this divers consideration of one, and the same person, is founded in the Scriptures, and light of reason. The Apostle teacheth, that both he and all others are insufficient <span class="hi">of themselvs, to think any thing, as of themselvs: but</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note249">2 Cor. 3. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 9. 1 Cor. 15. 10.</span> <span class="hi">sufficient,</span> as of God; that the faithfull may be <span class="hi">weak</span> in them­selvs, and haue <span class="hi">God perfecting his strength</span> in mans weakenesse; that <span class="hi">not</span> a mans selfe, <span class="hi">but the grace of God in him may labour aboundantly,</span> that is, he by <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t, and not by his own strength.

Is it a good argument that God may fail of his end, because he useth effectuall means wherby to obtain it, as exhortations and warnings are, to perseverance? Is it a good argument, that the conduit may want water, because a man (skilfull in water-works) layeth the conduit pipes with all diligence, and Art, between the Spring-head, and the Conduit? Or that the childe (whom his father holding him fast by the hand, in a slippery way, and bidding him look that he fall not) can fall out of his fathers hand? Nay, though left to himselfe, he may, yea cannot but fall; yet considering his Fathers strength (supposing him one that cannot fall himselfe) wherof the childe is made parta­kers for his supportance, he cannot fall: Such a holding, and helping hand of God are these exhortations, made effec­tuall by his Spirit in the hearts of his children, true beleevers. Vnto whom, as the Lord <span class="hi">suith, Seek yee my face;</span> so they <span class="hi">an­swer,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note252">Psal. 27. 8.</span> <span class="hi">Thy face, Lord doe we seek:</span> The Lord saith in his word, <span class="hi">Take heed, Stand fast, Beware that ye fall not away,</span> and the like.

The Lord Iesus giues his Apostles<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note254">Mat. 28. 19 20.</span> in charge to <span class="hi">teach all Nations whatsoever he had commanded them:</span> adding thereunto, the promise of his presence <span class="hi">with them,</span> if they so did, <span class="hi">to the end of the world:</span> against whom also a <span class="hi">Woe</span> was denounced <span class="hi">if they did not preach</span> the same <span class="hi">Gos­pell.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note255"><span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> Cor. 9. 16</span> I would now know whether it could so come to passe, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8918"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=54">[Page 103]</a></span> that these Apostles should not, and that willingly, preach this Gospell, and the truths thereof? This to affirm were to blas­pheme the holy Spirit of God, by which they were immedi­ately and infallibly guided in their Ministery.

If it be further objected, that <span class="hi">Esau</span> had right indeed to the <span class="hi">birth-right</span> (by them unskilfully called the <span class="hi">inheritance</span>) I answer, that he had never right to it spiritually, nor in Gods appoyntment, but onely in outward course, and in regard of men: and such a right to the heavenly inheritance may be, and is, by too many lost, as the Apostle here insinuates. Lastly, who sees not the difference between the inward grace of faith and holines in the heart of a true beleever; and the carnall right to that which is com­mon to good, and bad?</p><p>In <span class="hi">Math.</span> 5. 15.

I suppose it was never seen, that salt wanted saltnesse: and if it doe, how is it salt? Besides, Christ calles not his Apostles <span class="hi">salt,</span> and <span class="hi">light,</span> in regard of the grace of faith in their hearts; but of their preaching the Gospell, therewith to season and inlighten the world. 2. Pet. 2. 20. they pervert as the former places: making that abso­lute which is but conditionall, and with an <span class="hi">If. They</span> (say they) <span class="hi">which are washed, may return with the sow, to wallow in the myre, and their latter end be worse then the beginning.</span> The Apostle sayth, <span class="hi">If after they be washed,</span> &amp;c. These forms of speech, whe­ther in scripture, or other where, <span class="hi">If this, then that,</span> do not ne­cessarily prove, that either <span class="hi">this</span> or <span class="hi">that</span> is so indeed; but onely, that if <span class="hi">this</span> be so, then <span class="hi">that</span> also. Both <span class="hi">this</span> and <span class="hi">that</span> in them­selves may be impossible, and yet the consequence good: as if I should say at mid-night, <span class="hi">If it be day, the Sun is rising;</span> or at mid-day, <span class="hi">If it be night, the Sun is set:</span> so in the Scriptures, Luk. 19. 40. 1. Cor. 15. 13, 14. 15. 16. &amp;c. Gal. 1. 5. 10. and in in­finite other places. It is sufficient for the truth of a conditio­nall proposition, that the latter part follow infallibly upon the former; if it be; but requires not that it should be. These men and others herein labour of the same mistaking with the Disciples, Ioh. 21. 22. 23. who upon Christs words <span class="hi">to Peter</span> touching▪ <span class="hi">Iohn, If I will that he tarry till▪ I come, what is that to thee?</span> concluded, that <span class="hi">Iohn should not dye,</span> but should survive till the second comming of Christ; which fancy also continu­ed a long time in the mindes of many. But the Evangelist in<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note259">Vers. 23.</span> the same place teacheth them that will learn, not to inter­prete conditionall speeches, as absolute? <span class="hi">Iesus sayd not unto him, he shall not dye; but, if I will that he tarry till I come, or dye not.</span></p><p>If it be further replyed, that the Apostle aimes at certaine particular persons, which <span class="hi">denyed the Lord that bought them, whose pernicious wayes others followed, &amp; unto whom it did happen according to the true proverb▪ The dog is turned to his vomit again:</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note260">Vers. 4.</span> which same persons <span class="hi">Iude</span> also chargeth to <span class="hi">haue turned the grace of God into wantonnesse;</span> I willingly grant the thing so to haue <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9098"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=55">[Page 105]</a></span> been; but deny the conditionall form of speech to proue it absolutely. And for the thing, I answer, that the Apostles there speak of mens being <span class="hi">purged</span> and <span class="hi">washed,</span> and the like, according to the outward profession onely, which they for­merly made, and which the Church took knowledge of: and not according to the inward truth of the heart, which they knew not, but God alone. I add, to put the matter wholly out of question, that these Apostles thus speaking, doe in the same places both gather themselves by the event, and teach us that these persons, of whom they speak, were never truely and effectually sanctified, but onely in their own, and other mens opinion: as where <span class="hi">Peter,</span> v. 7. 8. 9. opposing <span class="hi">righteous Lot</span> to the <span class="hi">wicked Sodomites,</span> addeth, that as <span class="hi">God delivered him,</span> so fo he <span class="hi">knoweth,</span> that is, can and will <span class="hi">deliver the godly out of temp­tations, and to reserve the unrighteous to the day of judgment for punishment.</span> Likewise v. 21. <span class="hi">The dog is turned to his own vomit again: and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the myre.</span> They were alwayes then, in truth, but <span class="hi">Dogs</span> and <span class="hi">Swine,</span> though sometimes vomiting dogs, and washed on the out-side as swine are in the waters. And yet more plainly, of the same persons <span class="hi">Iude</span> sayth, v. 4. that they were <span class="hi">ungodly men, and be­fore of old ordained to that condemnation,</span> and such as <span class="hi">crept in un­awares.</span> They were at the best but hypocrites, in truth, and such as had crept in unawares, though seeming for a time to others (and it may be to themselves also) sanctified and pur­ged, by their outward profession which profession formerly by them made, the Apostle upbraids them with, to their grea­ter confusion.</p><p>To <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 10. 29. the same answer serveth. The form of speech is but conditionall, <span class="hi">If we sin wilfully,</span> &amp;c. v. 26. which proves, that if any so sin, then <span class="hi">there remaines no more sacrifice</span> for him: but proves not that any truly justified and sanctified, doth so sin. If it be asked, to what end then serves the fear­full denunciation used? I answer, first, to keep the truely faithfull from so sinning: 2. to awaken even the secure, if not not desperate. 3. to paint out the fearfull state of incurable <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9170"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=56">[Page 106]</a></span> hypocrites and Apostates. And as the particular persons unto whom the Apostle there hath reference, could not by him certainly be discerned ever to haue been truely and inwardly sanctified (<span class="hi">for what man knoweth the things of a man, saue the</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note261">1 Cor. 2. 11.</span> <span class="hi">spirit of man, which is in him?</span>) so by their after course of Apo­stasie from Christ, he seemeth not obscur<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ly to gather, and pronounce of them, that at their best they were but hollow­hearted; as v. 38. 39. making an opposition between the tru­ly <span class="hi">just</span> that <span class="hi">liues</span> (and perseveres notwithstanding all temptati­ons) <span class="hi">by faith;</span> and those <span class="hi">with-drawers to perdition.</span> So chapt. 6. speaking of the same, and like persons, <span class="hi">If they fall away,</span> v. 6. he insinuates against them, v. 8. that they were never other then <span class="hi">thorny earth,</span> opposed to <span class="hi">good earth, bringing forth hearbs meet for him that dresseth it.</span> As also, v. 9. 10. he makes it a poynt of <span class="hi">Gods righteousnes not to forget the work and labour of loue</span> of the truely faithfull, or <span class="hi">beloved;</span> viz. so as to suffer them to <span class="hi">fall away</span> from the <span class="hi">things which accompany saluation.</span> With which accords that else-where, <span class="hi">Faithfull is he that calleth you,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note262">1▪ Thess. 5. 22▪ 23.</span> <span class="hi">which will also doe it;</span> that is, will <span class="hi">preserv</span> the truely faithfull <span class="hi">blamelesse unto the comming of the Lord Iesus Christ:</span> as doth that also in the parable, where onely the <span class="hi">seed sown</span> in the <span class="hi">stony,</span> or <span class="hi">thorny ground withered,</span> and was <span class="hi">choked before</span> the harvest; but<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note263">Matth▪ 13.

The same answer serveth to 1.

Is it to be conceived, that <span class="hi">Moses</span> for the sin of others; whereof he was altogether innocent, yea for his holy zeale and loue to­wards Gods people, should be blotted out of the book of life? If you say, that yet some (to wit <span class="hi">sinning</span>) may be <span class="hi">blotted out,</span> I grant it in Gods sense, but not in theirs. For first, this is meant of temporary, and not of eternall life, of the <span class="hi">blotting</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note264">Deut. 9. 14.</span> <span class="hi">their name from vnder heaven;</span> of the <span class="hi">destroying them, and making of Moses a nation greater then they.</span> Of that of which God is sayd to <span class="hi">repent</span> upon <span class="hi">Moses</span> his prayer, v. 14. which was onely in regard of their temporall state and life. 2. It is not onely vanity, but impiety also to affirm that these persons were ever truely justified and sanctified. Not onely <span class="hi">Moses</span> and <span class="hi">Aaron,</span> but God himselfe upon this very occasion testifies the contra­ry, v. 9. 22. Deut. 9. 7. 13. To Psal. 69. 29. I answer, that <span class="hi">Da­vid</span> means▪ no more, then that his adversaries should no lon­ger be continued in the Church and fellowship of Gods peo­ple, the latter part of the verse expounding the former, <span class="hi">Let them not be written with the righteous:</span> which the Prophet <span class="hi">Eze­ch<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>el</span> termes, <span class="hi">not being vvritten in the vvriting of the house of Is­rael.</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note265">Ezek. 13. 9.</span> And seeing <span class="hi">David</span> here speaks of certain particular per­sons his adversaries, let these men shew the markes by which he knew certainly that they were once truely justified and san­ctified, or by which they know them so to have been.

Iustification &amp; sanctification make men the servants of Christ at first these talents were given to them that were servants already: and that <span class="hi">according to their severall ability</span> for their speciall places. Besides, the <span class="hi">taking away of the talent</span> here spoken of, is not in this life, but at the day of judgment: and therefore is unskilfully brought for their purpose.</p><p>Touching <span class="hi">Pauls</span> affirming <span class="hi">that the Saints at Rome were justi­fied by faith,</span> Rom. 5, and yet threatning, <span class="hi">that if they continued not in the bounty of God, they should be cut off,</span> ch. 11. 21. I an­swer, as before; first, that the threatning is conditionall, as <span class="hi">Gal</span> 1. 8, <span class="hi">If we, &amp;c.</span> Was it possible that <span class="hi">Paul</span> should <span class="hi">preach any other Gospell?</span> Or were he an <span class="hi">Angell from heaven,</span> or of God that should so doe? I suppose no, ch. 4. 14. But an An­gell from hell rather, and of the divell. The question is not whether if any should not abide in the bounty of God, they were to be cut off or no? But whether any with whom hee hath dealt so bounteously, as indeed to justifie and sanctifie them, haue not also a promise, by his power, to be kept in that his bounty, by the means which he hath appointed? Secondly, <span class="hi">Paul</span> pronounceth those <span class="hi">Romans</span> justified, not from the judgement of certainty, but of charity. Of whom as some were undoubtedly sincere, whom God did by this, and the like warnings, preserv and keep in his grace: so for the hy­pocrites mingled amongst them, it was but that which we say, if in their time they were broken off from that which for­merly <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9482"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=57">[Page 109]</a></span> they seemed to others by their profession (and it may be to themselvs also) to haue had.</p><p>And indeed, this very place, if it be well minded, mini­sters full answer to the most of their Arguments. This warn­ing (though immediately given to the <span class="hi">Romans</span>) concerns all Christians as well as them: And being founded upon an ex­ample of the Lords dealing with the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> must be expounded, and applyed accordingly. Who then were these exemplary <span class="hi">Iews,</span> formerly cut off by the Lord from the oliue tree? Were they such as had once truely beleeved, but had after made defection? I suppose not even in these mens judgment; but such as occupying a place in the Church, yet were, in truth, faithlesse hypocrites, and as <span class="hi">chaff in the</span> Lords <span class="hi">flore,</span> which<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note268">Math. <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>. 1<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">the Son of man comming with his fan in his hand purged out.</span> And in these we may see, what kind of <span class="hi">branches</span> they are, which in time come actually and visibly to bee <span class="hi">broken off from the Oliue.</span></p><p>The instances following of <span class="hi">Elies house loosing the Priesthood, Saul the Kingdom of Israel,</span> and the <span class="hi">Israelites Canaan,</span> serv one­ly to fill up room. That Priesthood, Kingdom, and Canaan, were not the graces of faith, and sanctification in the heart: nor the losse of them sin, but punishments onely. Onely the last place Math. 18. 32, where <span class="hi">debt forgiven is,</span> as they say <span class="hi">re­called,</span> were something to the purpose, if the drift of the pa­rable were to shew, that God indeed forgivs sins, and after unforgives them: which were lightnesse unbecomming any graue, and honest man. But the scope of the parable being no more, then that we ought to forgiue such as offend us, and that otherwise God will not forgiue us: to draw more from it, is to forget that it is a parable, and to take the high way to to most grievous errour. Besides, there is in this parable no colour for falling away from grace, and true godlinesse, for­merly had; but onely (even their exposition being admitted) that a man may haue his sins pardoned, who yet wants all brotherly loue and goodnesse, which the Scriptures every where deny, Math. 6. 14. 15, Mark. 11. 24. 25, 1 Ioh. 3. 14. 15, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e9553"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=58">[Page 110]</a></span> Rom. 8. 1, Ps. 32. 1. 2. Thirdly, by these grounds, no man can certainly know, that his sins are indeed pardoned, whilst he liues in the world, because he may still fall away, and so haue his pardon recalled, though <span class="hi">sealed</span> up unto him by the very <span class="hi">spirit</span> of God it selfe. And so all our faith must be but adven­ture<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note269">Eph. 1. 13.</span> whilst we liue in the world, whether our sins past be in truth pardoned, or no; contrary to the Scriptures. Lastly, this impeacheth both the justice of God, and his truth. His justice in making him require double satisfaction for the same debt; first, of his Son, even the price of his bloud, and the same also by faith, applyed to the person that hath sinned and beleeveth; and after of the person himselfe. Of his truth, and that both of his word absolutely promising forgiuenesse of sins to him that beleeveth, and also of his spirit, by which<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note270">Rom. 3. 25. Eph. 1. 13.</span> he seals up the same unto their hearts.</p><p>Their second and third reason, taken from <span class="hi">the fall and sin</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note271">Pag. 80▪ 8. 1</span> <span class="hi">of Adam,</span> and <span class="hi">all mens falling, and sinning in and by him,</span> are wholly besides the question: which is onely of falling from the grace of God in Christ▪ from <span class="hi">election in him,</span> from <span class="hi">the loue</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note272">Ephes. 1. 4.

God gaue <span class="hi">Adam</span> his portion in grace by creation, and left it in his own keeping, which hee soon mispent: but hath dealt more mercifully with us in making his Son our feof<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>er in trust, that he as our head, might keep and improue the grace of God belonging to us, as is meet for us: lest we having <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ll at once, and that same left in our own hands, should mispend all, as <span class="hi">Adam</span> did.</p><p>To that which they alledge from Eph. 1. 4, compared with Rev. 2. 4. 5, I answer, first that <span class="hi">Paul</span> stiles those <span class="hi">Ephesians elect</span> onely as he knew them so to be; which was by outward ap­pearance of holinesse. Secondly, that the <span class="hi">leaving of their first loue</span> was not a total falling from grace, but onely a decaying of their former zeal. Thirdly, the threatning of the <span class="hi">Candlesticks removing,</span> was to the truely called, an effectuall means of draw­ing them to repentance.

But herein they draw violently Christs purpose to their own. For Christ, as may be seen, by comparing herewith v. 16. 26. 27, is to shew how it came to passe, that some of his hearers beleeved and obey­ed his voyce, and some not. Many of the Iews <span class="hi">beleeved not, because they were not his sheep:</span> some did, being his <span class="hi">sheep,</span> to wit, by destination of God. Christ saith not, that they are not his sheep, because they beleev not; but that they beleev not, because they are not his sheep; that is, not being of the elect of God, they are left to their own impenitent, and unbeleev­ing heart, which they also willingly harden against Christs voyce. Where v. 16, he saith, <span class="hi">Other sheep I haue which are not of this fold, whom also I must bring</span> &amp;c, hee means the elect amongst the Heathens destinated to that one <span class="hi">Sheep-fold,</span> under him that one <span class="hi">Shepheard,</span> and by his voyce to be <span class="hi">brought</span> ther­to. This is yet more plain v. 15, where he saith, <span class="hi">I giue my life for my sheep.</span> Christ <span class="hi">dyed for the ungodly,</span> Rom. 5. 6. 8.

V. 12, the same word is used, <span class="hi">the wolfe catcheth and scattreth the sheep,</span> that is, corrup­teth them, as Math. 7. 10, Act. 20. 29, where the same word is used also. As they are elsewhere too prodigall of Christs benefits to all the goats in the world, so are they here too nig­gardly of them to his own sheep: Although in truth they grant, though unawares, as much as we plead for, in saying, that those <span class="hi">sheep, so long as they continue his sheep, haue spirituall peace and safety</span> &amp;c.

The Scriptures also ascribe the whole work of our salvation, as <span class="hi">election, redemption by the bloud of Christ, vocation, revelation of heavenly things, justification, sanctification, adoption, faith, repen­tance, and the giving of the Spirit, issue out of temptations, and continuing blamelesse to the comming of the Lord,</span> unto <span class="hi">the good pleasure</span> and <span class="hi">loue</span> of God alone. It is true, that <span class="hi">we must also loue God,</span> as they say: But we must know▪ withall, that this our loue of God depends upon his loue of us first, and the same <span class="hi">shead abroad into our hearts by his Spirit,</span> which giues <span class="hi">te­stimony therof to our spirits:</span> which, as it were, forceth loue again from us to God, and the continuance of it the conti­nuance of our loue; according to that of the Apostle, <span class="hi">The loue of Christ constraineth us.</span> For as the beams of the Sun shed into the bosome of the earth first heat it, and so cause it to reflect heat again towards heaven: so by <span class="hi">the loue of God shead into our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given us,</span> our hearts are most effectually drawn, and perswaded to loue God againe, and men for, and according to him. Which I further also manifest thus. Our <span class="hi">loue,</span> whether to God or man, <span class="hi">ariseth from</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note292">1 Tim. 1. 5.</span> <span class="hi">faith unfeyned.</span> Faith stands in the assured perswasion of the heart, by the Holy Ghost, of Gods loue to us: Wherupon I conclude, that our salvation depending immediately upon our faith, loue, and obedience, as conditions requisite by Gods ordination, and they upon Gods loue (and the same known) to us, and so the continuance of them upon the continuance of it; the question is properly, and principally of the loue of God to us, and the unchangeablenesse therof.</p><p>For Rom. 11. 29, they dream waking, that the meaning is<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note293">Pag. 88. 89</span> that <span class="hi">God will never repent of saving all persons at all times, in all places,</span> that <span class="hi">seek salvation by faith in Christ, and continue ther­in.</span> If this were all, what needed the Apostle v. 33, to break <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10222"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=61">[Page 117]</a></span> out into that admiration of the <span class="hi">riches of the wisedom, and know­ledge of God, and of the unsearchablenes of his judgments?</span> What strange thing is it, that God should not repent of so gracious a purpose and promise, as is that of saving such as beleev in his Sonne. Secondly, it is more then evident, that he speake not here of saving all at all times, but of the saving of some at sometimes; namely, of the <span class="hi">Israelites</span> in their time, and of<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note294">Vers. 25. 26 30. 3<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>.</span> <span class="hi">the Gentiles</span> in theirs. Thirdly, the Apostle speaks not of sa­ving them that beleev, but of <span class="hi">giving the election to obtain mer­cy, to beleev.</span> Lastly, the words are a reason of that which goes before, the Israelites <span class="hi">touching election, are beloved for the Fathers sake,</span> v. 28. <span class="hi">For,</span> or because <span class="hi">the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;</span> as if he should haue said: though for the present, the body of the Israelites <span class="hi">be enemies for the Gospell,</span> that is, in not beleeving it, <span class="hi">till the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in;</span> yet <span class="hi">the election,</span> such as are that <span class="hi">Israel, according to election,</span> and <span class="hi">Gods people which he foreknew,</span> v. 2, them he <span class="hi">loues</span> in his de­cree unchangeably, <span class="hi">for their father, Abraham, Isaak, and Iakobs sake,</span> and <span class="hi">without repentance;</span> and so will in their time make them actually partakers of his most gracious <span class="hi">gift and calling.</span> They here add certain Scriptures (and may doe many moe) proving that God denies the effect to conditionall promises, men breaking the conditions first: But as the Scriptures cited by them, speak not all of salvation in Christ; so neither doe any other shew, that God ever alters purpose, or promise of saving any, whom he once loved in Christ, whether in decree, or application of loue.</p><p>The last place which they labor to elude is, 1 Ioh. 2. 19. <span class="hi">They</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note295">Pag. 90. 91▪ 92. 93.</span> <span class="hi">went out of us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would, no doubt, haue continued with us, but they went out, that they might be manifest, that they were not all of us.</span> And here, in stead of answering directly to the place, they make out-leaps, as their manner is: making us to affirm that <span class="hi">God hath predestinated some persons to salvation,</span> and <span class="hi">some to damnation without any conditi­on: and that these persons (the elect) making never so great shew of wickedness, and walking in the wayes of Belial, are still elect,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e10313"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=62">[Page 118]</a></span> <span class="hi">and can by no means fall out of their election: the other persons ha­ving never so many testimonies of godl<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>nesse, and walking in the Church of Christ, yet can never but be reprobates, and if ever they fall away from the Church, or truth, that they were never truely of it.</span></p><p>We affirm, that God predestinates none to salvation but with condition of the death of Christ, and the persons (coming to years of discretion) faith, and repentance, and continuance therin to the end, to goe before that their salva­tion: nor to damnation, but with condition of sin, and im­penitency therein to goe before that their damnation. But our Adversaries being bold and presumptuous, speak evill of the things which they neither know, nor are walling to under­stand. Onely, these two things we further hold in this case. First, that the former conditions (Christ, and faith in him) are Gods free gifts also, infallibly and effectually obtained by the former persons: the latter condition (impenitency in sin) the certain effect of Satans malice, and their own corruption, being left of God thereunto.

For what makes them that are alike, when the Gospel comes alike unto them, not to remain alike stil? And what is the reason why the one receivs it, and not the other?

Fourthly, in saying, <span class="hi">They went out of us, that it might be manifest that they were not all of us,</span> he shews that by their out-leaps, something was manifested which was hid before. But it was plain before, to the Apostles and Saints, that lying spirits were not of the truth.

In the former where God saith, he <span class="hi">could doe no more to his vineyard then he had done,</span> he speaks onely of outward means, as the text makes it plain, <span class="hi">I fenced it &amp;c.</span> I would ask these men, whether there be not requisite, that the naturall vineyard may bring forth fruit, something besides the <span class="hi">fencing, gathering out of the stones,</span> and the rest there mentioned?

And where God saith, <span class="hi">He expected sweet grapes, but it brought forth wild v:4.</span> we must not imagine (as our adversaries seem to doe) that God is deceaved in his expectation, as men often are: but onely, that the <span class="hi">Israelites</span> did not perform that which God required, and they ought.</p><p>Touching the <span class="hi">repentance</span> of <span class="hi">Tyre &amp; Sidon.</span> First I would know how they prove that Christ speaks of other then legall repentance, such as <span class="hi">Ahab</span> manifested <span class="hi">in sack-cloth?</span> which was<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note328">1.

If Christ speak of his <span class="hi">mighty works,</span> as means though not sufficient of themselvs, yet availe­able, with other requisite helps, he excludes not the spirits work, but includes it. But, in truth, the meaning of Christ seems to be no more, but to reprove the obstinacy of <span class="hi">Corazin</span> in a form of speach like unto that Luk. 19. 40. <span class="hi">If these should hold their tongue, the stones would imediately cry out.</span> And as it were a vain thing hence to dispute about the speaking of stones; so is it, to gather any thing thence of the <span class="hi">Tyrians</span> re­pentance. <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11269"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=67">[Page 129]</a></span> The meaning of the Lord here is not to commend the <span class="hi">Tyrians</span> at all, but to upbraid the <span class="hi">Chorazites,</span> and to shew their hardnes of heart to be greater then the others.

They may as rightly say, that the life and motion of the childe is its begetting. To regenerate is nothing else, but to beget anew. Doth the child beget it selfe? Or doth not the parent onely beget it? So God begets by the Ministery of the Word, and man is begotten by him: according to that of the Apostle, <span class="hi">Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note344">Ioh. 5. 1.</span> <span class="hi">that is begotten of him.</span> So Iam. 1. 18. <span class="hi">Of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth.</span> By these mens doctrine we should beget our selvs of our own will. Begetting in creatures, is both in nature and time, before the being of the begotten. Men then before they be, must beget themselvs, by their saying. And as God regenerates, and not man; so doth man, being rege­nerated, beleev and obey, and not God. Wheras, if faith and obedience be regeneration, then God beleevs and repents; seeing God regenerates.

He speaks not therefore of the outward teaching onely, but withall, and principally, of the inward teaching of the spi­rit, as Esa. 54. 13, Ier. 31. 33. 34, 1 Ioh. 2. 27. The most of them whom the Father drew by heavenly doctrine, that is, to whom Christ preached, <span class="hi">murmured at him,</span> v. 41: this hee re­proues, vers. 43, &amp; vers. 44, takes away the offence which might arise, at the consideration of the small effect which his words had with many, considering what he testified of him­selfe, v. 39. 40, shewing that such was mans perversenesse in spirituall things, as that except God, to the outward word, adjoyned the inward work of the Spirit, thereby drawing him, his obstinacy could not, nor would not be tamed, nor he turned to God.</p><p>Lastly, to Phil. 2. 13. <span class="hi">It is God that works in you both the will and deed,</span> after much impertinent discourse, and many er­rours<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note348">Pag. 110. 111. 112.</span> mingled among, they answer, that <span class="hi">God doth this in men</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11724"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=70">[Page 134]</a></span> <span class="hi">by reasons, and perswasions, that they would chuse life, and avoyd death.</span></p><p>And first, they conclude without and against reason, that if the <span class="hi">regenerate haue power to resist, they haue power not to resist:</span> which is, as if a man should say, if a fool can doe foolishly, then he can doe wisely, or the like.</p><p>Secondly, it is a slander upon the <span class="hi">Calvinists,</span> that <span class="hi">they are di­vided</span> in this point; or that any of them <span class="hi">affirms, that the elect though unregenerate, cannot resist good.</span> Whilst they are unrege­nerate they can doe nothing else but resist in spirituall things: But God in time (as he hath decreed) by the spirit of regene­ration, overcomes their corruption, and works in them, not to resist, but willingly to follow him, that calleth them.</p><p>Thirdly, I would know what they mean by these phrases, of <span class="hi">Gods sending his word and spirit to work our regeneration:</span> and again, of <span class="hi">God by the power of his word and spirit, shewing man the benefite of life</span> &amp;c. If they consider the spirit onely as the Authour of the word, speaking in the men of God, why doe they not say <span class="hi">the Spirit and the Word,</span> rather then, as they do, <span class="hi">the Word and the Spirit?</span> Or how doth God <span class="hi">send the spirit,</span> thus understood, <span class="hi">to work regeneration in men?</span> If they answer, that God is ready to giue the spirit, and so doth to them that will receiv it: first, to be ready to giue, is not to giue or send: se­condly, they should understand, that to be willing to receiv spirituall things, is a main fruit and effect of regeneration, and therfore not a cause, as they mistake. For the will, thus holily bent, presupposeth the understanding divinely enlight­ned, whose direction it follows, and without which going before, it is blind and brutish. Neither can a man possibly will a thing, but as he understands it to be good for him. If the understanding be divinely inlightned, and the will holily bent, then the whole man is before regenerated, that is, be­gotten before of God by the spirit of regeneration.

The punishment Gen. 3. 17. 18. 19, reacheth to all <span class="hi">A­dams</span> posterity, and so the threatning, and by consequence the Law. Secondly, the Apostle teacheth, Rom. 2. 15, that <span class="hi">the Law is written in the hearts of the Gentiles,</span> according to which Law of nature written in their hearts (though they had it not written in tables of stone, as the Iews) they shall be <span class="hi">judged at</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e11991"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=71">[Page 137]</a></span> <span class="hi">the day</span> of the Lord, v. 15. 16. 17. These Gentiles cannot be imagined to haue this Law thus written any other way, then as God in the beginning created <span class="hi">Adam,</span> and all mankind in him, after his Image, in righteousnesse and holinesse; in which respect also they are said, to <span class="hi">doe by nature the things contained in the Law,</span> having also a naturall <span class="hi">conscience</span> in them, which without a Law were vain: Vnder which generall Law, bind­ing the reasonable creature to faith and obedience in all things (in disposition before use of discretion, and in act af­terwards:) the particular Law, Gen. 2, is conteyned, and to be referred unto it. Thirdly, if infants haue reasonable soules, then haue they the faculties of understanding and will, though not the actuall use of them, as men haue. This understand­ing cannot be conceived by any to be without all disposition and pronenesse, either to the knowledg of God, or to ig­norance, errour, and doubting of him; nor this will to bee without all disposition, and inclination to will according to, or against Gods will. As the yong whelps and cubs, of Ly­ons, Beares, and Foxes, haue in their naturall and sensitiue fa­culties, a pronenesse and inclination to raven; and every beast pronenesse to the things of its kind, after, actually performed, and practised by them: so haue infants necessarily in their rea­sonable faculties, a disposition, one or other, to understand and will things, specially such as concern God, by reason of the most naturall, necessary, and indossolible relation, between the reasonable creature, and the Creator, and that specially in those most noble faculties.</p><p>The objection from Rom. 7. 1, hath in it no colour of truth: for neither are there any such words, that <span class="hi">the Law is given</span> (especially onely, which must be added) <span class="hi">to them that know it:</span> neither doth the Apostle there intend at all, to shew to whom the Law was given, or not: but onely, that the Christian Church at <span class="hi">Rome</span> (specially many of them being Iewes, as appears chap. 16,) to which he wrote, was not ig­norant of the Law, whether generall or particular, to which he had reference in that place.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12035"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=72">[Page 138]</a></span>To Deut. 11. 2, besides things answered by Mr. <span class="hi">Ainsworth,</span> I adde, that <span class="hi">Moses</span> there excludes not onely infants, but many grown men as appears, v. 3. 4.

It is alas too evident, that they bring this corruption in­to the world with them. Secondly, by the Apostles words, v. 19, <span class="hi">For as by ones mans disobedience many were made sinners; so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span> If wee bee made unrighteous onely by imitation of <span class="hi">Adams</span> sin, and not by his performing it, as our root naturally; then we are made righteous onely by imitation of Christs righteousnesse, and not by his performing righteousnesse, and fulfilling the Law for us, as our spirituall root, in which wee are grafted by faith.</p><p>Lastly, these Adversaries grant, that <span class="hi">by Adams sin all his</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note356">Pag. 117.</span> <span class="hi">posterity haue weak natures▪ by which when the commandement comes, they cannot obey, and liue▪ but sin, and so die, Rom.</span> 8. 3.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note357">Rom. 8. 3.</span> <span class="hi">Can they which are accustomed to doe evill▪ doe well?</span> Or will these men never leav their godlesse custom of corrupting the words of the text, for advantaging of an evill cause?

In all which hee opposeth the <span class="hi">flesh</span> to the <span class="hi">spirit,</span> and the sinfull life of the one, to the righ­teous life of the other.</p><p>And I would know of these deep Divines, what but sin could possibly make <span class="hi">Adams</span> posterity unable to keep the Law? This flesh, or nature, as they will haue it, must be con­trary to this <span class="hi">good</span> and <span class="hi">holy Law,</span> and resist it. And is not that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note358">Rom. 7. 12.</span> properly sinfull and unholy, which resists, and is contrary to<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note359">See Rom. 7. 17. 18, &amp;c. &amp; Gal. 5. 17.</span> that which is good and holy; Lastly, this enemy to the Law of God in a man, must be in his soule. And what else can it be, then a disposition in the understanding, to ignorance and errour, touching God and heavenly things; and an inclinati­on in the will and affections to evill? Which is as properly sinne, as their acts and effects are properly sinfull. Infants therefore bring sin properly into the world with them.</p><p>Two things they here object: First, that <span class="hi">Christ often accounts children, innocents,</span> as Math. 18. 3. 4, &amp; 19. 14. I answer, first, not as they mean; that is, such as haue in them nothing vertu­ous<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note360">Mat. 18. 4. &amp; ch. 19. 13. 14. Mark. 10. 14. 15. 16.</span> or vitious; good, or evill; but as being <span class="hi">humble,</span> and with­out pride; and such, as unto whom <span class="hi">the Kingdom of God,</span> and his <span class="hi">blessing</span> did appertain. Secondly, He speaks not of all chil­dren, but of those, of, and in the Church.</p><p>Their second objection is, that <span class="hi">our soules being the subjects of sin, are created of God imediately.</span> But to this objection, they that referrs the soules originall, imediately to Gods super­naturall, and indeed miraculous work, do giue divers answers, which these Adversaries should haue refuted. Amongst others, Mr. <span class="hi">Ainsworths</span> answer is worthy the consideration. But let us consider their proofs for the soules immediate creation. The first is, Act. 17. 26, <span class="hi">Of one bloud God made all mankind,</span> &amp;c. But this place makes rather against them; seeing the bo­dy alone makes not mankind, but the soule with it, by which specially the man is. The next place is Heb. 12. 9, whence <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12189"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=73">[Page 140]</a></span> they <span class="hi">gather that Adam is the Father of our bodies, and God the Father of our Spirits.</span> But first, the Text neither mentions <span class="hi">Adam,</span> nor can agree to him in the state of creation: seeing in that estate there was no use of <span class="hi">correction.</span> Secondly, it saith not, <span class="hi">the fathers of our bodies,</span> but <span class="hi">of our flesh:</span> nor the <span class="hi">father</span> of<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note361">See: Com. pub. &amp; pri­vate pa. 107</span> our Spirits, but <span class="hi">of Spirits.</span> And the meaning seems unto me (with due respect had to other mens different judgment) one­ly to be this: that if we giue honour to men (our carnall or fleshly fathers) chastening us, as they think good: how much more owe honour to our spirituall father, chastening us for our eternall good? And surely God, in his kinde, is the father of the whole man, not of the soule onely: So is man, in his kinde, the father of the whole man, and not of the body one­ly. Lastly, seeing the drift of the place, is to shew, that God as a <span class="hi">father, chasteneth his sons which he loveth,</span> and on the con­trary, that they that <span class="hi">are not chastened, are not sons,</span> and so<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note362">Vers. 6.</span> haue not God for their Father, I see not how the Apostle can speak of the creation of soules, seeing in that respect, wicked and godly, children and <span class="hi">bastards,</span> haue God alike their father. The <span class="hi">Preacher,</span> ch. 12. 7, speaks of the manner of the creation of the first man <span class="hi">Adam</span> onely: but no more proues that our soules or spirits are created by God imediately, then that our bodies are made of dust immediately. That ch. 8. 8, hath no colour of proof in it.</p><p>Against our fourth and last assertion, that all by <span class="hi">Adams</span> sin are guilty of death, Rom. 5. 12, they cavill, that <span class="hi">we were not in</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note363">Pag. 114. 115.</span> <span class="hi">Adam to bring any soule to hell for the breach of that commande­mant, Thou shalt not eat.</span></p><p>Where, first (to passe by their incongruity of speech) they free <span class="hi">Adam</span> himselfe from the guilt of condemnation of which our question is, as well as his posterity, by that his sin; seeing it brought not him himself to hell. But secondly, &amp; for the thing it selfe: They grant, acording to the Scriptures, that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note364">Pag. 116.</span> <span class="hi">death,</span> as a part of <span class="hi">the curse, came over all Adams posterity for his sin:</span> And will they then deny, that eternall death was also due by the same law of justice? Is not the justice of God in­finite, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12277"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=73">[Page 141]</a></span> and so requiring infinite satisfaction? To what reasonable creature soever, the smallest punishment is due from God; the greatest is due also in rigour of justice. And so the <span class="hi">curse</span> (as they grant) <span class="hi">extending to Adams genera­tion</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note365">Pag. 116▪</span> <span class="hi">by his sin;</span> eternall condemnation, as the principall part of it, extendeth unto them necessarily, except mercy be shew­ed them.</p><p>Neither will it help our Adversaries, that <span class="hi">other creatures die</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note366">Pag. 116. 122.</span> also; seeing their absolutely mortall condition limits their punishment to this present life: But such is not the estate of infants; but their immortall soules, unto which their bodies at that day are to be reunited, makes the whole capable of a more full declaration of Gods justice, if he deale in severity therof without mercy, as he may. Besides, the Apostle saith, that <span class="hi">death passed upon all, for that all haue sinned, viz.</span> in that<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note367">Rom. 5. 12.</span> <span class="hi">one man Adam.</span> Doth death come over bruit beasts, because they haue sinned in <span class="hi">Adam?</span> They are brutish that see not the difference, which these men will not acknowledge. It is said else-where, that <span class="hi">in Adam all die.</span> Doe beasts die in <span class="hi">Adam,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note368">1 Cor. 15. 22</span> as his posterity doth? As all that <span class="hi">are Christs,</span> are <span class="hi">in Christ,</span> and <span class="hi">made aliue by him;</span> so all <span class="hi">Adams</span> posterity were in him, and die in him: Which <span class="hi">death</span> also the Apostle makes no lesse, then <span class="hi">judgement to condemnation,</span> to wit, if redemption be not ob­tained:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note369">Rom. 5. 16. 21. Pag. 117.</span> to which he opposeth <span class="hi">justification, and eternall life.</span> Ioyn herewith, these mens confession, <span class="hi">that all mankind by Adams fall are made unable to keep Gods precepts, when he giues them, and so all fall under the wrath of God, and are therfore said to be children of wrath, Eph.</span> 2. 3, and there is sufficient for their conviction, as hath been shewed. But I add, that the Apostle means plainly a further matter, and that all are born children of wrath: for to be so by nature, and to be born so, are the same. We are children of wrath by sin onely: If therefore all be children of wrath by nature, it is by the sin of nature, which we call originall sin, and not by actuall sin onely, as they surmise.</p><p>Lastly, I demand whether, if <span class="hi">Adam</span> had not sinned, hee <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e12364"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=74">[Page 142]</a></span> should not haue transferred to his posterity the Image of God after which he was created, and a pronenesse to keep it. (as notwithstanding sin, he doth some feeble remainders thereof)<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note370">Rom. 2. 14. 15▪</span> and therewith right to eternall life? If yea, why not then sin, and the guilt thereof, by proportion, having sinned?</p><p>To Ezech. 18, I haue formerly answered. He speaks of the sins of immediate parents, not of the first sin of our first fa­ther; which was naturall: whereas the other but personall; yea, not onely other mens, but his after sins also. Secondly, it is plain, he speaks of such children, as <span class="hi">seeing all their fathers sins, consider, and doe not the like, but doe that which is lawfull, and</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note371">Ezeeh. 18. 14. 15, &amp;c.</span> <span class="hi">right, keeping, and doing all Gods statutes.</span> To such God imputes no sin.</p><p>Their affirmation following is strange, that <span class="hi">Infants shall</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note372">Pag. 118. 119.</span> <span class="hi">receiv no judgment, because they haue done neither good nor evill, according to which all judgment passeth.</span> By this, they should nei­ther be saved, nor damned: for what else is it to receiv judg­ment of salvation, but to be saved? and so for the contrarie. They doe ignorantly exclude Infants from a state one, or other, for wanting that condition, which is required of men of years onely. They might as probably say, that Infants shall be damned; seeing Christ saith, <span class="hi">He that beleevs not shall bee</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note373">Mark. 16. 16. 2 Thess. 3. 10.</span> <span class="hi">damned:</span> or should not eat, because it is said, He <span class="hi">that will not work shall not eat.</span></p><p>To the place, Ps. 51. 5, <span class="hi">Behold I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceiv me;</span> they answer not directly, but by many <span class="hi">Ifs, &amp; ands:</span> chusing many uncertain vanities, ra­ther then one certain truth: which is, that <span class="hi">David</span> in this whole context confesseth his transgression and sin.

The ground of this errour in so ma­ny is, that they understand not the true nature of the Gospell, and Ordinances thereof. The Gospell aymes not at the exacting upon man (as made after Gods own image) obedi­ence due, as a naturall debt from the creature to the Creator, as the Law doth, but considers him as a most miserable crea­ture▪ drowned in sin, and altogether unable to help himselfe: neither yet servs it, and its Ordinances, primarily to declare and manifest, what man in right owes, and performs to God; but what God in mercy, purposeth, &amp; doth, and will perform to man: being <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> a joyfull message, or glad tydings of salvation by Christ. So, to apply this for the baptizing of In­fants, albeit they on their part, can for the present, make no manifestation or declaration of obedience or thankfulnesse, or any other goodnesse: yet sufficeth it for Evangelicall dis­pensation, that God, according to the Covenant of grace, <span class="hi">I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</span> can and will make ma­nifestation and declaration of his gracious minde of washing them, with the bloud and spirit of his Son, from the guilt and contagion of sin: they also, being bound in their times, to reciprocall duties. Let us not think scorn, as proud free­willers doe, of Gods taking, both of us, and our infants, to be his people, going before our, or their taking of him to be our God: But let us rather magnifie his mercie in this regard, both towards us, and them.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.3"><div class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13231"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=79">[Page 152]</a></div><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.3. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>NExt, they undertake to proue, that <span class="hi">Infants are not rege­nerate,</span> and so <span class="hi">not to be baptized.</span> Their reason is, because<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note408">Pag. 134.</span> they haue <span class="hi">not faith and repentance.</span> This <span class="hi">Regeneration</span> they de­fine to be <span class="hi">a turning from sin to God:</span> which they would proue from <span class="hi">Rom.</span> 6. 11.</p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.4"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.4. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>THE Apostle, Rom. 6, speaks not of regeneration it self, which is Gods work: but of our <span class="hi">living to God,</span> as an effect therof.

The Apostle therfore making the children holy, and their holinesse a ground of the husbands lawfull keeping, and conversing with his wife, can haue respect to no other thing then the Covenant with <span class="hi">Abraham, I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed;</span> as a known and received ground by the Co­rinthians, and all other Churches. This will yet be the more plain, if we bear in mind, that the question propounded to <span class="hi">Paul</span> by the beleeving Corinthians was, not whether they might keep their children or no, but their wiues. Hee had therfore no occasion of mentioning the children, as he doth, but to fetch from them an Argument for the retaining of the wiues. Now, if his meaning were, as they say, that <span class="hi">the chil­dren were holy to the beleevers use, as the wife was,</span> then he should haue argued from the holinesse of the wife, to proue the ho­linesse of the children: But thus he doth not, but the clean contrary. Besides, if the Apostle had argued as they would haue him, where had he laid the foundation of his proofe? <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13695"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=81">[Page 157]</a></span> Or how had he removed the scruple out of the Corinthians hearts?</p><p>They add, that the <span class="hi">Corinthians made no question of their chil­dren.</span> True; and that overthrows their exposition; as shew­ing, that the Apostle argues not from the wiues to the chil­dren, as they make him; but from the children to the wiues: Secondly, the Apostle disputes not from the Corinthians sup­position, or perswasion, but from the truth of the thing, the holinesse of their children. <span class="hi">But now are</span> (your children) <span class="hi">holy.</span></p><p>They object, that these <span class="hi">children must be holy, either as the beleeving, or unbeleeving part is holy.</span> We say they are holy as the beleeving part, in regard of that foederall holinesse, and the spirit of regeneration.

The errour in both is, that they consider not <span class="hi">Iohns Baptism,</span> and <span class="hi">Christs</span> according to their distinct parts; <span class="hi">Iohns</span> as outward, <span class="hi">Christs</span> as inward: <span class="hi">Iohns</span> outward Baptism, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13781"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=82">[Page 158]</a></span> and <span class="hi">Christs</span> outward Baptism were the same: for <span class="hi">Christ</span> was baptized by <span class="hi">Iohn,</span> thereby sanctifying Baptism to us, as cir­cumcision to the Fathers by his being circumcised. The in­ward Baptism is not <span class="hi">common to all,</span> but peculiar to the elect: the outward, whether by <span class="hi">Christ,</span> or <span class="hi">Iohn,</span> is not <span class="hi">peculiar to the elect onely,</span> but common to others with them: witnesse <span class="hi">Simon Magus.</span> The outward Baptism by <span class="hi">Iohn,</span> and all other Ministers was, and is, onely <span class="hi">with water,</span> opposed to Christs, as the inward <span class="hi">with the Holy Ghost.</span> Which Baptism with the Holy Ghost, being understood of extraordinarie gifts, sometimes<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note425">Math. 3.

Ghost</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note426">Pag. 140.</span> herein they take upon them to <span class="hi">explain</span> to others, not under­standing it themselvs, as is evident, in that they will haue this <span class="hi">baptizing unto Moses in the clovd, and sea, &amp;c.</span> to haue been onely for bodily deliverance, and the offer of Christ. But the Apostle looks upon those things with a more piercing and spi­rituall eye: as appears, first in that, <span class="hi">v. 1,</span> he cals the Israelites indefinitely, his and the Corinthians <span class="hi">fathers. Morever brethren I would not haue you ignorant, that all our fathers</span> &amp;c. As if hee should haue said, Let not the children look for more privi­ledg from punishment, if they sin, then their fathers haue in­joyed. He therfore considers the Church of israel here, as in the state of a spirituall fatherhood to the Corinthians. Se­condly, hee expresly saith, that they were <span class="hi">all baptized to Moses,</span> and that the <span class="hi">meat</span> was <span class="hi">spirituall</span> which they <span class="hi">eat,</span> and <span class="hi">the rock,</span> or water, <span class="hi">which they drank spirituall,</span> even <span class="hi">Christ</span> himselfe, to wit, sacramentally, and mystically. Thirdly, the Apostles ar­gument, that it may goe in full force, must thus be framed. They that are alike for substance in Gods benefits, shall alike be punished, if they sin alike: But you Corinthians now, and Israel of old were, and are alike in those spirituall benefites mentioned; Therefore, if you sin, as they did, you shall sure­ly be punished, as they were. If the Apostle had propounded <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e13885"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=82">[Page 159]</a></span> unto the Corinthians, the <span class="hi">tokens of Gods loue and protection</span> onely for bodily things, as they carnally conceiv, there had been no force in his reason against the security of the Corin­thians, especially occasioned by their enjoying the Lords Or­dinances of Baptism, and the Supper as signes, and tokens of Gods loue for spirituall blessings in heavenly things. Might they not easily haue answered <span class="hi">Paul,</span> that the Israelites indeed might well perish, and be destroyed for such things as they practised, having onely Gods loue-tokens for bodily delive­rance: but for them, they were better secured against danger, as having the tokens of Gods loue for spirituall and eternall deliverance, by the body and bloud-shed of Christ?</p><p>I conclude therefore, that <span class="hi">all Pauls,</span> and the <span class="hi">Corinthians fa­thers,</span> being baptized with the Baptism signifying deliverance by Christ, and many of them being Infants, the Infants of Israel now are to be baptized also.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.9"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.9. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p><span class="hi">THey object, that</span> the meaning of the Holy Ghost is not, that Moses did at all wash them with water in the cloud and sea.</p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.10"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.10. </span><span class="head">DEPENCE.</span></h3><p>NEither say we he did; but with the Apostle, that they <span class="hi">were baptized to Moses in the cloud and sea:</span> God not one­ly preserving them bodily thereby from <span class="hi">Pharaoh;</span> but also moystening them with the <span class="hi">cloud arising out of the Sea,</span> and<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note427">1 King. 18. 44. 45.

They frame the question; <span class="hi">whether any but Pastors or Elders may baptize?</span> and my charge upon them; that <span class="hi">they are unbaptized, because, they want Pa­stors.</span></p><p>But where haue I so spoken? or how gather they that to haue been my meaning? had it so been, why could I not as easily haue said, that none but Pastors (for of baptism by others <span class="hi">Elders which labour not in the word and doctrine,</span> we ap­prove<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note488">1 Tim. 5. 17▪</span> not) may lawfully baptize; as, that <span class="hi">none but such as are lawfully called by the Church may baptize?</span> which are my words.

Is it not the Scrip­tures<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note491">Acts 11. 26</span> constant voice, and these mens plea (true in it self, but to a wrong end) that men must first <span class="hi">beleeue,</span> and <span class="hi">repent,</span> and upon manifestation thereof, be <span class="hi">baptized?</span> Are not they that beleev, and repent <span class="hi">Christians</span> with them? Otherwise, How doe they baptize them? But thus it is with men in all sects, that are lead by passion, and appetite, more then reason: they doatupon some one thing truly or apparantly good: and labor aboue measure, to magnifie it, esteeming all things without it, as nothing. Thus these men esteem of baptism, others of Church government, others of seperation, others of imposition of hands by Bishops; And so, according as men haue advantage by particulars, or suffer for them, or are otherwise prejudiced towards them, they set high valuation upon them. But as grace teacheth us to acknowledg better things in Christians then any outward ordinances; so must wisdom warn us not to ascribe too much to any one, as fond folks use to doe to the person, or thing which they affect.</p><p>Math. 18. 20, is against them.

Onely, I here add this one thing. If members, and Churches be made by Baptism, I demand, when <span class="hi">I.

And if one alone may receiv or make members of the Church, why not also cast them out, and excommunicate them without the Churches presence or privity?

First, it is absurdly said, that a man is made <span class="hi">a Christian by his Baptism,</span> as he is <span class="hi">made a Minister</span> by his outward calling. He that is not a Christian be­fore he be baptized, becomes not one thereby: But by the outward calling of the Church, hee that was no Minister be­fore, become such properly and imediatly. Secondly, a man is to be baptized but once: and God adding to the outward<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note504">2 Chron 30 18. 19. 20.</span> washing with water that which is inward, and by his spirit, sanctifies the former, and covers many faylings in the man­ner of administring it: but a man may on the contrary, upon occasion, be called divers times to a Ministery, in divers Churches, one after another. Thirdly, the Ministery is the<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note505">1 Cor. 3. 21 22. 23. &amp; ch. 12. 28.</span> Churches, and depends upon it as the adjunct upon the sub­ject, so as if the Church dissolue, the Ministerie ceaseth: which the same Church also that giues it, may take away, and make him that was a Minister no Minister: Besides, that in the mean while his Ministery is bounded within the precincts of that Church wherof he is an officer. But in the ordinance of Baptism the case is clean otherwise. For neither can the Church which hath given it, take it from him; neither cea­seth he to remain a baptized person, though alone, and with­out either Church, or other Christian in the world with him; neither is he in any Church where he comes, to bee barred from the priviledges of his Baptism, or use of any thing de­pending upon it.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.31"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.31. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p>FOR the justifying of the manner of their rebaptizing,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note506">Pag. 161.</span> and to proue <span class="hi">that the Disciples of Christ, though no Pastors</span> (they must add, nor having any Church-calling) <span class="hi">may bap­tize:</span> their first instance is from <span class="hi">Iohn Baptist, who was no Pa­stor, and yet baptized.</span></p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.32"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.32. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>WEE grant it; No more was Christ himselfe a Pastor in our sense, nor his Apostles.

Onely they tell us in the generall, that <span class="hi">these things were written for our learning:</span> We grant it, and therewith affirm, that amongst other things, we are to learn this from them; that such as are to baptize, are to be furnished with (besides, and aboue the gift of teaching) a speciall warrant and calling from Christ, either extraordinary and immediate, as had these <span class="hi">disci­ples,</span> and <span class="hi">Ananias;</span> or ordinary, and mediate by the Church: which alone is delegated by Christ the Lord, with authority to call men to the ministering of his solemn Ordinances; wherof Baptism is one, and not the use of a gift, as bare teaching is.</p><p>In opening Math. 28, <span class="hi">Goe teach all Nations,</span> &amp;c. they shew<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note511">Pag. 102▪ 163.</span> a strange streyn of wit; in gathering from thence, that <span class="hi">any disciple of Christ may baptize,</span> from whence all others of lear­ning or judgment (of all Sects) doe gather the contrary, and that none, but such as haue speciall calling to teach may bap­tize. Let us examine things particularly.</p><p>And first, I affirm, that the Lord in that place giues an Apostolicall commission properly; which I thus proue. First, because he bids them <span class="hi">Goe,</span> or <span class="hi">goe forth and teach all Nations:</span> opposing the Apostles going forth, and teaching all Nations then, to the Prophets tarrying, and teaching that one Nation of the Iews formerly. Doe or can these men (though their <span class="hi">feet abide not in the house, Prov.</span> 7. 11,) goe to, and teach all Nations? Their answer is frivilous, that <span class="hi">every Disciple is to doe this according to his best abilitie,</span> seeing the Lord calls none to a state or work, but such as he furnisheth with answerable abilities. By such answers, the calling of any how unfit so­ever, to any place or state how excellent soever, might be <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16435"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=97">[Page 188]</a></span> justified. Secondly, if not in this place, I would know when, and where Christ gaue the commission properly Apostolicall.</p><p>Where they add, that <span class="hi">the Apostles haue left their power whol­ly behind them, and that nothing is dead but their persons:</span> they erre not a little; For not onely their persons are dead, but their office also is ceased. If any now haue the power of A­postles, they haue then the office of Apostles first, from which the power is, and in which it is to be exercised. If they <span class="hi">say, they are Apostles;</span> they <span class="hi">are not,</span> but are easily <span class="hi">found lyars</span> by plain direction of the Scriptures. Besides, they expresly con­tradict<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note512">Gal. 1. 1. 1 Cor. 1. 9. &amp; ch▪ 4. 9.</span> themselvs in the same place, in saying, <span class="hi">The commission was given to such, as whose persons remains to the end of the world.</span> If their <span class="hi">persons be dead,</span> how <span class="hi">remain</span> they? But they add, as their corner stone, that <span class="hi">this commission was given to the succee­ders of the Apostles in their doctrine from time to time, with whom Christ promiseth to be present alwaies, even to the end.</span></p><p>If I should answer (as I know not but I might lawfully,) that these words of Christ, <span class="hi">I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world,</span> are to be expounded as those of the Apo­stle, 1 Thess. 4. 15. 17, <span class="hi">Wee which are aliue, and remain unto the comming of the Lord,</span> and that the meaning of both is, that all should so walk, as if that day of the Lord were to come every day of their liues, what would they reply?</p><p>But admit this be spoken mediately to the successours of the Apostles (not in their power Apostolicall, for that ceaseth with their office Apostolicall, and their office with their persons; neither is there left in the Church any authority or direction for the chusing of Apostles, but) in the performance of such ordinary works, in lawfull order, as the Apostles were to exercise themselvs in, specially of teach­ing and baptizing, there mentioned: I thus proue, that by those successors are not meant, as they conceiv <span class="hi">disciples,</span> but such as haue speciall commission, and authority, and so speci­ally Pastors.</p><p>And first, Christ here opposeth them to whom he speaks, as the <span class="hi">makers of Disciples</span> (as the words are) to <span class="hi">Disciples</span> to be <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e16505"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=14749&amp;page=97">[Page 189]</a></span> made by them. Secondly, if every disciple of Christ, then why not women also, which are disciples as well as men, and wherof there are diverse to be found better gifted then any of this fellowship? Neither can they object the Apostles pro­hibition of women, 1 Cor. 11, &amp; 1 Tim. 2, seeing they hold Baptism no Church action, but personall onely; and so ad­minister it as privately, as Midwines use to doe. Thirdly, if Pastors be most rightfully the Apostles successors in other works of their Apostolicall commission here given; by name, in administring the Lords Supper, and <span class="hi">over-seeing the flock,</span> and <span class="hi">defending the same in the truth,</span> which they grant: why not in teaching, and baptizing also, which alone are expressed?

Yet because the gift fits for the of­fice, and enables to the performing of it many unskilfully confound them. Secondly, there is both a liberty, and duty of using the same gift in time &amp; place, before and without the of­fice. But herewith (the office concurring) is joyned, and added a bond of authority, and speciall charge upon the of­ficer to wait upon <span class="hi">his office, the Teacher in teaching,</span> the <span class="hi">Exhor­ter, or Pastor in exhortation,</span> as the Apostle speaks.</p><p>Here amongst sundry Scriptures, not so much as looking<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note521">Pag. 164.</span> towards the matter in hand, but speaking of the generall li­berties of Christians, and graces of Christianity, common to women with men, and to such men as want all gifts of teach­ing with others, they alledg, 1 Cor. 14. 1, and the <span class="hi">Apostle then commanding every beleever to covet to preach.</span></p><p>But first, why put they <span class="hi">preaching,</span> and not <span class="hi">prophesying,</span> as the Text, and all translations haue it? Secondly, it is their presumption, that he speaks of every beleever. Was every beleever to <span class="hi">covet spirituall gifts,</span> to wit, all both extraordi­nary and ordinary there mentioned? And are there not many in all Churches, who, without a miracle, cannot possibly at­tain to any competent ability to teach publiquely in the Church? But let them stretch the words to their own size, what follows hereupon? All are to desire the gift of exhor­tation, &amp;c. and such as haue it, to use it in time and place: <span class="hi">Er­go,</span> it is not required of Pastors by vertue of their office to ex­hort. Why not then thus? It is required of every member of the Church in his place, to watch for the good of the whole, and to defend the same against gain-sayers in the truth: and therfore it is an <span class="hi">imagination,</span> which these men in the page be­fore going affirm, that the <span class="hi">Pastour is by his office to watch, and defend the flock against gain-sayers:</span> Or thus. It concerns every<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note522">Rom. 12. 13</span> Christian, being able, to <span class="hi">distribute to the necessities of the Saints,</span> and therefore not to the Deacons by vertue of their office; which yet for the very thing are called <span class="hi">Distributers</span> in the same<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note523">Vers. 8.</span> place.

Their conclusion therefore, that a Pastor is not bound to teach by his office, because hee mightafter a sort, and in an order, teach without it; it is, as if they should tell us, that he who is bound to a post with one coard, cannot be bound with two.</p></div><div class="adversary" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.37"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.37. </span><span class="head">ADVERSARIES.</span></h3><p><span class="hi">THey add, that</span> the Church may receiv in members, without officers, or when they are sick, or in prison, <span class="hi">and so</span> baptize <span class="hi">them,</span> as the primitiue Churches were gathered by faith and bap­tism, and that being without Pastors a good while, which the Apostles afterwards placed amongst them.</p></div><div class="defense" id="index.xml-body.1_div.6_div.38"><h3><span class="headingNumber">6.38. </span><span class="head">DEFENCE.</span></h3><p>THey oft say, but never proue, that Churches are gathered by <span class="hi">baptism.</span> Baptism is an ordinance and <span class="hi">service</span> given to<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note524">Rom. 9. 4.

Here I one­ly demand of them, whether one man alone, without either presence, or preceding election of the Church, may ordain a Pastor, as is their manner of baptizing. And for me, doe they not know in their consciences that I was ordained pub­liquely upon the solemn calling of the Church, in which I serue, both in respect of the Ordainers, and Ordained? Whilst then they account me <span class="hi">wilfully blinde</span> in putting difference be­tween my <span class="hi">Church ordination</span> &amp; their Baptism; they shew them­selvs witlesly blinde in making them alike.</p><p>To my proof, from Math. 3, that <span class="hi">Christ in comming to Iohn</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note533">Pag. 168.</span> <span class="hi">to be baptized of him, fulfilled all righteousnesse,</span> &amp;c. they an­swer, <span class="hi">That this is still done, when any disciple, &amp;c:</span> Wherein first, they make both <span class="hi">Iohn</span> and <span class="hi">Christ,</span> disciples of Christ: Se­condly, if Christ had herein considered <span class="hi">Iohn</span> as an ordinarie disciple onely, what needed he to haue come from one coun­trey to another, even from <span class="hi">Galilee,</span> to <span class="hi">Iordan</span> in <span class="hi">Iudea,</span> to haue been baptized of him?

He doth not proue his authority to baptize, by a common authority or liberty to teach, which any of Israel (gifted) might use; but he justifies his whole mi­nistery, in all the parts of it, by his speciall calling, as the har­binger and fore-runner of Christ, plainly foretold by <span class="hi">Esay</span> and <span class="hi">Malachy.</span> Doe they think, that the Prophets words, <span class="hi">The voyce of one crying in the wildernes,</span> appertained to every Israelite that could teach; as they ascribe power to baptize to each of their teaching disciples? Or might <span class="hi">Iohn,</span> without a special calling, haue instituted and brought into the Church, as he did, a new ordinance?

If from hence they would conclude any thing as lawfull from the greater to the lesse, they must argue thus. If it be lawfull to swear by the greater, then by the lesse much more: But it is lawfull to swear by the greater, and greatest, <span class="hi">God</span> him­self, <span class="hi">that dwelleth in the temple:</span> Therefore it is lawfull to swear by the temple, altar, sacrifice, heaven, earth, &amp;c.
