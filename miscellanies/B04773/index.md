## 1\. Poor Robin's Dream, commonly call'd, Poor Charity.

I know no reaſon but this harmleſs Riddle,

May as well be Printed as Sung to a Fiddle.

To a compleat Tune, known by Muſicians and many others, or, Game at Cards.

HOw now good fellow, what all amort?

I pray thee tell me what is the news?

Trading is dead, and I am sorry fort.

which makes me look worſe than I uſe;

If a man hath no employment whereby to get a penny

He hath no enjoyment if that he wanteth mony,

And charity is not uſed by many.

I have nothing to ſpend nor i've nothing to lend,

I've nothing to do, I tarry at home,

Sitting in my chair, drawing near to the fire,

I fell aſleep like an idle drone,

And as I ſlept I fell into a dream,

I ſaw a Play acted without e're a theam,

But I could not tell what the Play did mean,

Yet afterwards I did perceive,

and ſomething more did underſtand,

The Stage was the world wherein we live,

the Actors they were all man kinde,

When the Play is ended, the Stage down they'l fling

Then there will be no difference in this thing

Betwéen a Beggar and a King.

The firſt that acted I proteſt,

was Time with a Glaſs and a Sithe in his hand

The Globe of the world upon his breaſt,

to ſhew he could the ſame command,

Ther's a time for to work, and a time for to play

A time for to borrow, and a time for to pay,

And a time that calls us all away.

_[figure]_

COnſcience in order takes his place

and very gallantly plaies his part,

He fears not to flye in a Rulers face

although it cuts him to the heart,

He told them all this is the latter age,

Which put the Actors into ſuch a Rage,

That they kickt poor Conſcience from the ſtage,

Plain dealing preſently appears

in habit like a ſimple man,

The Actors at him mocks and jeers

pointing their fingers as they ran

How came this fellow into our company?

Away with him many a gallant did cry,

For plain dealing will a beggar dye.

Diſſimulation mounted the Stage,

but he was cloathed in gallant attire,

He was acquainted with youth and age,

many his company did deſire,

They did entertain him in their very breaſt,

There he could have harbour and quietly reſt,

For diſſemblers and turn-coats fares the beſt.

Then cometh in poor Charity,

methinks t\ſhe looked wondrous old.

She quiverd and quakt moſt pitteouſly,

it griev'd me to think ſhe was grown ſo cold,

She had béen ith' City and in the Country,

Likewiſe amongſt the Lawyers and the Nobility

But there was no room for poor Charity.

Then comes in Truth not cloathed in wool,

but like youth in his white Lawn ſléeves

He ſaies the Land is full, full, full,

too full of Rebells worſe than theeves,

The City's full of poverty, the French are full of pride

Phanaticks full of envy, that order can't abide,

And the Vſurers bags are full beſide,

Hark how Bellonia's drums do beat,

methinks it goes ratling through the town,

Hark how it thunders through the ſtreet

as if it would ſhake the Chimney's down,

Then comes in Mars the great God of war

And bids us face about, and be as we were,

And when I awakt I ſate in my Chair.
