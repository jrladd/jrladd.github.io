In particular, it is thought a fit Psalme to be recited when the King hath recouered health; or when a gracious King begins his Reigne: Because these times are <span class="hi">Times of blessing</span> from the King: And these are, or ought to be, <span class="hi">times of Thankesgiuing</span> from the people. My Text then is in part for the day: For I hoped well it would haue been <span class="hi">Tempus restaurationis,</span> a time of perfect re­storing for the Kings health, and thankes were due for that: And it is <span class="hi">Dies creationis,</span> the Anniuersary day of his Crowne; and thankes is due for that. And there is great reason, if you will receiue the <span class="hi">Blessing,</span> that you giue the <span class="hi">Thankes.</span></p><p>The Text it selfe is a reason of that which is found v. 5.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note12">Verse 5.</span> There it is said, that <span class="hi">God hath layd great dignitie and honour vpon the King.</span> And here is the <span class="hi">Meanes</span> by which, and the <span class="hi">Reason</span> why hee hath layd it there. So three parts wil diuide the Text, and giue vs order in proceeding. The first is the <span class="tcpmilestone">1</span> <span class="hi">Meanes,</span> by which God layes honour vpon the King. Not honour onely, which they <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e385"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=4">[Page 4]</a></span> all haue as Kings: but that great honour in his saluation, which attends good and gracious Kings. And the <span class="hi">Meanes</span> are two-fold <span class="tcpmilestone">1</span> in the Text: <span class="hi">Dando &amp; Laetificando,</span> By Giuing, and by Ioying. By giuing the <span class="hi">King</span> as a <span class="hi">Blessing</span> to the people; <span class="hi">Thou hast giuen <span class="tcpmilestone">2</span> him, or set him as Blessings for euer.</span> And by Ioying the King for <span class="hi">blessing</span> the people: <span class="hi">Thou hast made him glad with the ioy of thy <span class="tcpmilestone">2</span> Countenance.</span> The second is the <span class="hi">Reason</span> both of the Honour and the Meanes of laying it vpon the King: And that is, <span class="hi">Quia sperat</span>; Because the King puts his trust in the Lord. <span class="tcpmilestone">3</span> The third is the <span class="hi">Successe,</span> which his Ho­nour shall haue by his Hope, <span class="hi">That in the mercy of the most High he shall not bee mooued, he shall not miscarie.</span></p><p><span class="tcpmilestone">1</span> I beginne at the first: The <span class="hi">Meanes</span> by which God adds <span class="hi">Honour</span> euen to the <span class="hi">Maie­iestie of Princes.</span> And because that doubles in the Text, I will take the first in order, which is, <span class="hi">Dando</span>: Thou layest great Ho­nour vpon the King, <span class="hi">by giuing or setting him, as Blessings for euer.</span> In which Meanes of laying Honour, the circumstances are three.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e458"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=4">[Page 5]</a></span>And the first of the three tells vs what a <span class="tcpmilestone">1</span> <span class="hi">King</span> is; and that's worth the knowing: And marke the <span class="hi">Holy Ghost,</span> how he begins. He describes not a King by any of his <span class="hi">Hu­mane infirmities,</span> such as all men haue: And no meane ones are registred of <span class="hi">Dauid,</span> the particular King spoken of: No, that had beene the way to dishonour the King; which is no part of Gods intention. But hee begins at that which crownes the Crowne it selfe. He is <span class="hi">Benedictio,</span> a <span class="hi">Blessing,</span> and no lesse, to the people. And therefore in all things, and by all men, is to bee spo­ken of, and vsed as a <span class="hi">Blessing.</span></p><p>Now it is one thing for a <span class="hi">King</span> to bee <span class="hi">blessed</span> in himselfe, and another thing to be <span class="hi">giuen</span> or <span class="hi">set vp,</span> as a <span class="hi">Publike Blessing</span> to other men. <span class="hi">Dauid</span> was both, and he speakes of both. A King then is a <span class="hi">Blessing</span> to, or in himselfe (as the <span class="hi">Septuagint</span> and <span class="hi">Tremellius</span> giue the words: <span class="hi">Dedisti illi benedictiones</span>; Thou hast giuen <span class="hi">blessings</span> to him) when by Gods grace hee is <span class="hi">Particeps sanctificationis,</span> Partaker of Gods hallowing Spirit. For no man, <span class="hi">King</span> or <span class="hi">Subiect,</span> can be <span class="hi">blessed</span> in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e537"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=5">[Page 6]</a></span> his soule without <span class="hi">Religion</span> and <span class="hi">Holinesse.</span> And if these bee counterfeites, such also is his <span class="hi">Blessednesse.</span></p><p>But a King is giuen as a <span class="hi">Blessing</span> to o­thers, when in the riches of Gods grace vpon him, he is made <span class="hi">Diuinae Bonitatis fons medius,</span> A mediate fountaine of Gods goodnesse and bounty streaming to the people; When he turnes the graces which God hath giuen him, to the benefite of them which are committed to him. For marke the <span class="hi">Heauens,</span> and the <span class="hi">Earth</span> will learne. God did not place the <span class="hi">Sunne</span> in the heauens onely for heighth, but that it might haue power to <span class="hi">Blesse</span> the inferiour world, with <span class="hi">Beames,</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Light,</span> and <span class="hi">Warmth,</span> and <span class="hi">Motion. Dauid</span> was thus, and thus was <span class="hi">Christ,</span> and such is euery <span class="hi">King</span> in his pro­portion, that sets vp these for his example. It is not easie to match <span class="hi">Dauid</span>; but a better example then <span class="hi">Christ</span> cannot be found. And therefore when <span class="hi">Clem. Alex.</span> had described a King indeed,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note13">Lib. 1. stro.</span> One that is <span class="hi">Beatus &amp; Bene­dicens,</span> a blessed and a blessing King; Or, if you will, as it is here in the <span class="hi">Abstract, Ipsa be­nedictio, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e616"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=5">[Page 7]</a></span> Blessing</span> it selfe, He is <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>t <span class="hi">Cumsmodi est Dominus</span>: Such as is Christ. There, the perfect example of <span class="hi">Blessing.</span></p><p>Now while the King is said to bee a <span class="hi">Blessing,</span> let me put you in mind that there is a double <span class="hi">Benediction.

That which Descends, is the <span class="hi">Blessing of Benefit</span>; That is the <span class="hi">Kings bles­sing.</span> He aboue, and this drops from him. In this, like God, whose immediate Vicege­rent he is.

The <span class="hi">Blessing</span> which Ascends, is that of <span class="hi">Praise,</span> and <span class="hi">Thankes,</span> and <span class="hi">faire interpretation of Princes Actions</span>: And this is the peoples <span class="hi">Blessing.</span> And they are both in Scripture together.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note15">3.

And the people labour his honour: that is their <span class="hi">blessing</span> reaching vp to him. And in this sence also as well as the former, a King is said, <span class="hi">Poni in benedictionem,</span> to be set vp as a <span class="hi">Blessing,</span> that is, for one whom the people ought to blesse. For Gods ordinance, <span class="hi">Ho­nour the King,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note18">1 Pet. 2.17.</span> 1. <span class="hi">S.

And there is no good diuision be­tweene a King and his people, but this one; That in parting of this <span class="hi">great good</span> of a gra­cious gouernement; The Kings part be the <span class="hi">Honour</span>: The peoples part may be the <span class="hi">Bene­fit</span>: and both meete againe in the <span class="hi">Blessing.</span> And it is so in my Text; For, <span class="hi">Ar.

Now Blessing and Ioy, are both grounded vpon <span class="hi">Hope</span>: this <span class="hi">Hope</span> in the Lord, this <span class="hi">Hope</span> includes, Faith, and Religion, and so this <span class="hi">Hope</span> stands a­midst <span class="tcpmilestone">4</span> the foundations of Kings.

There is a double condition in the Text, if <span class="hi">Dauid</span> will not miscary: the one is <span class="hi">Ex parte Dauidis,</span> on <span class="tcpmilestone">1</span> <span class="hi">Dauids</span> side: and that is at <span class="hi">Sperat,</span> a religi­ous heart to God that cannot but trust in him. The other is <span class="hi">Ex parte Dei,</span> on Gods <span class="tcpmilestone">2</span> side, and that is at <span class="hi">Misericordia,</span> a mercifull prouidence ouer the King, which knowes not how to forsake, till it be forsaken, if it doe then. Let vs call in the Prophet for witnesse,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note64">Psal. 94.18.</span> <span class="hi">Psal.</span> 94. <span class="hi">When I said, My foot hath slipped, thy mercie, O Lord, held mee vp.</span> Now the foote of a man slips from the conditi­on, from the trust, (as <span class="hi">Cassian</span> obserues) <span class="hi">Mobilitate Arbitrij,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note65">Collat. 3. c. 12.</span> by the changings of the will, which is too free to sinne, and breach of trust: the Holder vp in the slip is <span class="hi">Mer­cie,</span> therefore it is safest relying vpon the condition which is on Gods side, that is Mercy, for that holds firme, when men breake.</p><p>And marke my Text, Hope goes be­fore, and <span class="hi">Non commouebitur,</span> hee shall not miscary, followes after: but yet it followes not, till the Mercy of the <span class="hi">Highest</span> bee come <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3534"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=24">[Page 44]</a></span> in betweene. And indeed to speake pro­perly, all those things which the Scripture attributes to the Faith and Hope of man, are due onely <span class="hi">Misericordiae Altissimi,</span> to the Mercy of the <span class="hi">Highest,</span> which both giues and rewards them.</p><p>And yet for all this, the Hope of the Beleeuer, and the mercie of God in whom hee trust's, are happily ioyned in my Text. Because the Hope of Faith can obtaine no­thing without the Mercie of the Highest: And that Mercie &amp; goodnes will not pro­fit any man, that doth not beleeue &amp; trust in it. And Hope, and Mercie are not better fitted to secure <span class="hi">Dauid,</span> then Mercie and the Highest are, to make him apprehensiue of his assurance. For Goodnesse and Mercie are inualid without Power: Now that is supplied by <span class="hi">Altissimus</span> the Highest. And power is full of terrour when it stands a­part from goodnesse: and that is supplied by <span class="hi">Mercie</span>: When both meete, the Hope of man is full. So <span class="hi">Dauid</span> cannot but see all firme on Gods side; And sure hee is not to miscarry, if hee looke to performance <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3566"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=24">[Page 45]</a></span> of his owne. And though it be safeste­lying vpon God, yet it is neuer safe to disioyne them whom God hath put to­gether: And therefore as hee is mercifull, so man must bee faithfull; Hee must trust.</p><p>And now to end at home <span class="hi">Dauid</span> is gone long since to his <span class="hi">Hope,</span> the <span class="hi">Mercy of the Highest</span>: But a King, a gracious King, is li­uing ouer vs in Peace, and Happinesse, as our eyes see this day.</p><p>I know Hee remembers why God set Him ouer this great and numerous peo­ple: that is, <span class="hi">in Benedictionem,</span> euen to <span class="hi">blesse</span> them: And that he hath beene a <span class="hi">Blessing</span> vnto them, malice it selfe cannot deny. And I make no question, but hee will goe on with the Text, and be <span class="hi">Blessings</span> to them <span class="hi">for euer: For euer</span> through his whole time: and <span class="hi">for euer</span> in his generous Posteritie. <span class="hi">Tu dedisti,</span> Gods gift is through all this; and I will euer pray, that it may neuer faile.</p><p>He hath giuen this people all His time, the <span class="hi">Blessing of Peace</span>: And the sweete Peace of the people,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note66">Cassiod. lib. 5. epist. 39.</span> is <span class="hi">Praeconium Regnan­tium,</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3624"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=2042&amp;page=25">[Page 46]</a></span> the Glory of Kings.
