But he in his wrathfull diſpleaſure thinking vpon his mercy, hath not brought vs vtterly to nothing, nor caſt away this our wretched lumpe of ours into euerlaſting tormentes, but with an vnſpeakeable equitie and lenitie, hath graunted vs a ſpace to turne vnto him, and hath giuen vs Teachers which might call vs backe from our errour and idolatry, vnto true acknowledgement of God, &amp; to the right vſe of calling vpon him. Therefore let euery one ſay with <span class="hi">Iere­mie, Lamentat. <span class="hi">3.22. It is the mercies of God, that wee are not conſumed.</span></span> And againe with the patriarck <span class="hi">Iacob. <span class="hi">I am vnworthy O Lord of all thy mercies beſtowed vpon me, <span class="hi">Geneſ.</span> 32.9, 10.</span></span></p><div class="q"><span class="bibl">Verſe 6</span> <p>Then ſhal the earth bring forth her increaſe: and God euen our owne God ſhall giue vs his bleſsing.</p> <div class="biblfree">Verſe 7</div> <p>God ſhall bleſſe vs, and all the endes of the world ſhall feare him.</p></div><p>In the latter verſes are two notable places, one of the efficacie of the miniſterie of the goſpell: an other of the myſterie of the <span class="hi">Trinitie.</span> Truely the teachers and prea­chers of the goſpel ſeeme to profite no more therein then as the prouerbe is) <span class="hi">The Oxen plowing vpon the ſand, or as he that rolleth a ſtone vp againſt a hill.</span> But that the labour of them which teache in the church is not in vaine, theſe ſayings doe witneſſe, <span class="hi">Iſay <span class="hi">55.10.11.

But not in vaine, nor without good cauſe is <span class="hi">The name of God</span> here repeated thrice. For although there is one diuine eſſence: yet notwithſtanding there are three perſons of this Godhead, namely the <span class="hi">Eternall father,</span> who ſent his ſonne to take our humane nature vpon him:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note54"><span class="hi">One God in eſ­ſence 3. diſtinct perſons.</span></span> The ſame ſonne who is called by <span class="hi">Iohn. <span class="hi">1.</span> cap. verſe <span class="hi">1.</span></span> the <span class="hi">word</span>; and by <span class="hi">Iſayas cap. <span class="hi">7.14.</span> cap. <span class="hi">8.8.</span></span> &amp; <span class="hi">Mat. <span class="hi">1.23.</span> Immanuel:</span> and <span class="hi">The holy Ghoſt</span> proceeding from them both. And al­though vngodly and prophane perſons doe deride vs ſo beleeuing and ſpeaking: yet notwithſtanding mens minds muſt with teſtimonies of diuine manifeſtations be ſo con­firmed, that they which defend contrary opinions may by vs be both deſpiſed and refuted. For there can bee made no true praier without conſidering of the difference in theſe three perſons. Let our minde therefore be directed vnto this true God, who made himſelfe knowne by ſending his ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for our ſakes crucified and raiſed from death to life. And truely let vs expreſſe in the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3836"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=5457&amp;page=30">[Page 51]</a></span> beginning of our prayer the perſons by name, and let vs conſider what is the property of ech of them, that may be diſcerned from all creatures, and let our true prayer bee diſcerned from the praier of the heathen, and although it is here meant, that the reuiuing is giuen and made by all the three perſons, yet this is done by order: The ſonne who gathereth a Church immediately by the preaching of the goſpel moueth our hearts, ſheweth the Father, and giueth the holyghoſt: Therfore ſaith this pſalme in the laſt verſe, <span class="hi">God ſhall bleſſe vs,</span> that is, <span class="hi">Emanuel</span> God with vs, the ſonne of God, who tooke vpon him our nature to become our mediator, redeemer, iuſtifier and ſauiour.
