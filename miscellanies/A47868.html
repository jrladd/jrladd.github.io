We are come to govern our selves by Dreams, and Imaginations; We make every <span class="hi">Coffee-house Tale</span> an Article of our Faith; and from Incredible Fables we raise Invincible Arguments. A man must be Fierce and violent, to get the Reputation of being <span class="hi">Well-Affected;</span> as if the calling of one another <span class="hi">Damn'd Heretique,</span> and <span class="hi">Popish Dog,</span> were the whole Sum of the Controversie. And what's all this but the effect of a Popular Licence and Appeal? When every Merce­nary Scribler shall take upon him to handle matters of Faith, and State; give Laws to Princes; and every Mechanique sit Iudge upon the Government! Were not these the very Circumstances of the late <span class="hi">Times?</span> When the Religious Iugglers from all Quarters fell in with the Rabble; and managed them, as it were, by a certain fleight of hand: The <span class="hi">Rods</span> were turned into <span class="hi">Serpents</span> on both sides, and the Multitude not able to say, which was <span class="hi">Aaron,</span> and which the <span class="hi">En­chanter.</span> Let us have a Care of the same Incantation over again. Are we not under the protection of a Lawful Authority? Nor was there ever any thing more narrowly Sifted, or more vigorously discouraged, than this <span class="hi">Conspiracy. Reformation</span> is the proper business of <span class="hi">Government</span> and <span class="hi">Council;</span> but when it comes to work once at the wrong End, there is nothing to be expected from it, but <span class="hi">Tumult</span> and <span class="hi">Convulsion.</span> A Legal and Effectual provision against the Danger of <span class="hi">Romish Practices</span> and <span class="hi">Errours,</span> will never serve their turn, whose Quarrel is barely to the <span class="hi">Name</span> of <span class="hi">Popery,</span> without understanding the <span class="hi">Thing</span> it self. And if there were not a <span class="hi">Roman Catholick</span> left in the three Kingdoms, they would be never the better satisfied; for where they cannot <span class="hi">find</span> Popery, they will <span class="hi">make</span> it: nay and be troubled <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e369"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=93059&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> too that they could not <span class="hi">find</span> it. It is no new thing for a Popular Out-cry, in the matter of <span class="hi">Religion,</span> to have a <span class="hi">State-Faction</span> in the belly of it. The first late Clamor was against <span class="hi">Downright Popery;</span> and then came on <span class="hi">Popishly Affected; (That</span> sweeps all) The <span class="hi">Order of Bishops, and the Discipline of the Church</span> took their Turns next; and the next blow was at the <span class="hi">Crown</span> it self: when every Man was made a <span class="hi">Papist</span> that would not play the Knave and the Fool, for Company, with the Common People.</p><p>These things duly weighed, and considering the Ground of our pre­sent Distempers; the Compiler of this Abridgment reckoned that he could not do his Countrymen a better Office, than (by laying before them the naked state of things) to give them at one view, a Prospect, both of the subject matter of their Apprehensions, and of the Vigi­lance, Zeal, and needful severity of the Government on their behalf. To which end, he hath here drawn up an <span class="hi">Historical Abstract</span> of the whole matter of Fact concerning those Persons who have hitherto been Tried for their Lives, either upon the <span class="hi">Plot</span> it self, or in Relation to it: opposing Authentick Records to wandring Rumours; and deli­vering the <span class="hi">Truth</span> in all Simplicity. He hath not omitted any one material Point: There is not so much as one <span class="hi">Partial Stroke</span> in it; not a flourish, nor any thing but a bare and plain <span class="hi">Collection,</span> with­out any Tincture either of Credulity, or Passion. And it is brought into so narrow a Compass too, that it will ease the Readers <span class="hi">head,</span> as well as his <span class="hi">purse;</span> by clearing him of the puzzle of <span class="hi">Forms,</span> and <span class="hi">In­terlocutories,</span> that serve only to amuse and mislead a man, by break­ing the Order, and confounding the Relative part of the <span class="hi">Proceeding.</span></p><p>Having this in Contemplation; and being at the same time possest of a most exact <span class="hi">Summary</span> of all passages here in Question; This Re­porter was only to cast an Extract of these Notes into a Method: especially finding, that upon comparing the substance of his own papers, with the most warrantable Prints that have been published; his own <span class="hi">Abstract</span> proved to be not only every jot as Correct, but much more Intelligible, which being <span class="hi">short</span> and <span class="hi">full;</span> he thought might be useful, and find Credit in the world upon its own account, without need of a <span class="hi">Voucher.</span></p></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_front"><li class="toc"><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-front.1_div.2">TO THE READER.</a></li></ul><ul class="toc toc_body"><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.1">THE HISTORY OF THE Charge and Defence OF EDWARD COLEMAN, Esq</a></li><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">2. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.2">THE HISTORY OF THE Charge and Defence OF William Ireland, Thomas Pickering and Iohn Grove.</a></li><li class="toc"><span class="headingNumber">3. </span><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-body.1_div.3">The History of the Charge and Defence of Tho.

As to the Caution of not hastening before the time, or being too publick, for fear the Design should be suspected, wherein Secrecy was naturally necessary; Mr. <span class="hi">White­bread</span> expounded it, that the Design was the getting of a Congregation, which it was prudential to keep secret, as a thing not permitted in this Na­tion; declaring upon his Salvation, that there was no other Reason for the enjoyning of that Secrecy: offering farther, that it would be very hard to take away mens lives upon a word, that may as well bear one Construction as another: instancing in the usual way of speech, <span class="hi">I have a design to dine here or there tomorrow,</span> where the word <span class="hi">design</span> is properly enough made use of.

Upon his Importunity to be entertain'd in the Society, the Prisoner perswaded him to withdraw, reflecting upon him as a person not answerable to the purpose he pretended to; and that for severall Reasons. First, for his Prin­ciples; for he held severall Opinions that were not sound. Secondly, his Life was loose, and therefore he was desired to retire. To which end, he had a suit of Cloaths given him, a Periwigg, and 4 <span class="hi">li.</span> in his Pocket, which <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e8848"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=93059&amp;page=20">[Page 33]</a></span> he promised to repay upon the fale of his Library in <span class="hi">London;</span> but he ne­ver did. The Prisoner took notice of the just Wonder of the Court at wri­ting to <span class="hi">Dugdale</span> by the Post in so plain and dangerous terms; and the like in his discourse to Dr. <span class="hi">Oates:</span> but concluded in craving the Court's leave to produce Witnesses, that from the 10. of <span class="hi">Decem.</span> to the 23. of <span class="hi">Iune</span> fol­lowing Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> was at <span class="hi">S.

Omers</span> for his Misdemeanors, should after that make him privy to all his Letters. The Prisoner desired the Court to take notice, that he had a thousand Letters taken from him, and not one Syllable either of Trea­son, or of solliciting people to come over, was charged upon him out of those Letters. Urging, that all the proof made was but <span class="hi">saying</span> and <span class="hi">swea­ring;</span> and defying any man to make out any probability to any unbyassed judgement, how this could possibly be. Here the Prisoners were min­ded, that there is no other Evidence to be given, then by <span class="hi">saying</span> and <span class="hi">swea­ring. Fenwick</span> pursued his discourse, declaring, that he did no more think of his being taken or accused, then of his death; and that he removed no­thing; and that besides Letters, there were seized in Bonds and Bills to the value of five or six thousand pounds; and it seems strange, that out of all this there should nothing of a design appear. <span class="hi">For God's sake</span> (said the Prisoner) <span class="hi">where are the Commissions sign'd? and the moneys paid?</span></p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Hilsley</span> being presented to the Court as a Witness on the behalf of the Prisoners,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note199">The Priso­ners beg that their Witnes­ses may be sworn.</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Whitebread</span> begs that their Witnesses might be sworn: which though it would not be granted, because it was against the King; yet the Jury were directed to value the Testimony according to the credit of the Persons, and the Matter in question.

The VVitness parted with him then, upon his promise to come to him at <span class="hi">Somerset-House</span> Cloyster that night: but the VVitness knowing the bu­siness, failed him; and saw him not again till <span class="hi">Munday Night</span> in <span class="hi">Red Lion</span> Court, where he met him. He charged the VVitness with not keeping his word, who told him that he fell into other Company; and besides that he could not ingage to kill any man without knowing, first,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note376"><span class="hi">Le Faire</span> ap­pointed Mr. <span class="hi">Bedlow</span> to meet him.</span> who it was. Well! (says he to the VVitness) be you at Nine a Clock to Night at <span class="hi">Somerset-House,</span> and you shall hear more.

There was no light in it but a Lanthorn; and by that the VVitness could discern the body. There was a <span class="hi">Cravat</span> about his Neck, drawn so streight, that the VVitness could not get his Finger betwixt. They had some discourse then of getting him away; pretending him to be one that was re­lated to a Person of Quallity. The VVitness was very much surprised when he found who it was; and urged the dropping of him into the <span class="hi">Thames</span> with weights to sink him:<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note379">Mr. <span class="hi">Bedlow</span> advised the sinking of the body in the <span class="hi">Thames.

They owned that they had strangled him and would have had the VVitness to help them out with him. But he excused himself as being yet too early, and that it were better to stay till about Eleven or Twelve a Clock, promising to be with them again: But (says <span class="hi">Le Faire) upon the Sacrament you took on Thursday you will be at the carrying him off to Night,</span> which the Wit­ness promised; and so they parted.</p><p>This lay heavy upon the VVitnesses Conscience, who could not re­solve to discover that which he had taken two Sacraments in a week to conceal. In this trouble of Thought, the VVitness went to <span class="hi">Bristol,</span> where God put it into his heart that some murthers were past, and greater to come; For the prevention whereof he was at last convinced of the duty of revealing this wickedness; and so made his application to the <span class="hi">King</span> and <span class="hi">Parliament</span> thereupon.

His business was, to get a Lod­ging as near the <span class="hi">King</span> and <span class="hi">Queen's Bath</span> as might be; which was done.

That he knew not of any date or name to it; and that he did not know whose Hand it was. It was then considered, that the Witnesse's Paper could not be the Letter Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> reflected upon, having neither Sir <span class="hi">George</span>'s Hand, nor his Name to't, as was presum'd of the <span class="hi">Other.</span> Sir <span class="hi">George Wakeman</span> then deny'd the writing any other Letter, then that of his Servant by his Dictate, which <span class="hi">Ashby</span> carry'd to the <span class="hi">Bath:</span> and saith that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> had charg'd him before the Lords but with One Letter.

But Sir <span class="hi">William</span> being so kind afterwards as to see him at the <span class="hi">Gate-house,</span> with two worthy Gentlemen, Sir <span class="hi">Philip Matthews</span> and Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Cuttler,</span> upon the Prisoner's affirming that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> was wholly a Stranger to him, the Prisoner was told, that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> (as a token that he knew him) describ'd a certain Mark upon the Hind-part of his Head: the Prisoner offering himself to the Company, to see if there were any such thing or no. The Prisoner did now desire, that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> might give an accompt of that Mark; and that the Jury would believe of him according as they found it true or false. Sir <span class="hi">William Waller</span> inform'd the Court, that he knew nothing of any Mark; but that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates,</span> when he came in, call'd the Prisoner by his name. Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> excus'd the Trouble he had given the Court, his Defence depending upon the Proof of Doctour <span class="hi">Oates</span>'s being a Stranger to him; desiring the Jury to observe, that such a Description was given; Sir <span class="hi">William Waller</span> owning a desire to see him with­out his Perriwigg, to look if he had a Shaven Crown: which Mr. <span class="hi">Mar­shall</span> said, Sir <span class="hi">William</span> must needs know could not be; it being an ex­perss Caution, that no <span class="hi">Religious</span> wear any such Testimony of his Profes­sion, in <span class="hi">England.</span></p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> inform'd the Court,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note476">Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> appeals to Sir <span class="hi">William Waller.</span></span> that upon Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span>'s first Evidence against him, he desired Sir <span class="hi">William,</span> that it might be put in writing: which Sir <span class="hi">William</span> refused; but promised to commit it to memory. Hereupon the Prisoner did now adjure Sir <span class="hi">William</span> as a worthy Gentleman, and as he should answer for it at the Last day, to be as good as his word. The Pri­soner said farther, that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> looking hard upon him, askt him what his Name was: which shew'd him to be a Stranger. And upon the Priso­ner's owning his Name to be <span class="hi">Marshall;</span> Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> told him, that he was call'd <span class="hi">Marsh.</span> Urging it, that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> seeing the Prisoner; saying that he did not know them; leaving them in bed, and at liberty to be gone; and he himself declaring that he was looking for Traitours; the Priso­ner left the Jury to judge, whether he had any thing to charge upon them. Sir <span class="hi">William Waller</span> protested solemnly, that there was nothing of all this. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> exclaiming, that he was astonish'd; and affirming, that upon a Controversie with Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> about it, Mr. <span class="hi">Gill</span> the Constable averr'd it, and promised to attend in Court to make it good. The Pri­soner averring, that he askt Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> why he did not seize him before, when he was searching for Traitours, if he knew the Prisoner to be a Traitour: whose answer was, before Sir <span class="hi">William,</span> that at That time he had no Commission to seize him. But Sir <span class="hi">William</span> remember'd nothing of This neither. Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> then ask'd Sir <span class="hi">William,</span> if he remember'd what Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> said upon a question of his seeing the Prisoner last Summer; which was, that he saw him <span class="hi">Iune, Iuly,</span> and <span class="hi">August.</span> Sir <span class="hi">William Waller</span> calling to mind something of That; Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> averr'd that he could prove himself in <span class="hi">Warwickshire</span> all those three Months; but that his Wit­nesses were not here; and that it was impossible to foresee what points would come in question. Whereupon he did submissiverly desire respite of the <span class="hi">Court,</span> for the producing of his Witnesses.</p><p>The Prisoner recommends over again the consideration of the <span class="hi">False Mark;</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note477">The Prisoner recommends himself to the <span class="hi">Court</span> and <span class="hi">Iury.</span></span> the Dr's. finding him in bed, and yet not knowing him; his point­blank Evidence upon <span class="hi">August</span> 21; and the most certain means he had of Dis­proving <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e22980"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=93059&amp;page=48">[Page 88]</a></span> it: still insisting upon a very short time to bring up his Witnesses.</p><p>Mr. <span class="hi">Corker</span> minded the Court of the Officers,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note478">Witnesses for the Prisoners.</span> and others, that said, up­on the taking of <span class="hi">Pickering,</span> that they had nothing to say against the Pri­soners; which a Servant of the house was then ready to attest.</p><p><span class="hi">Elenor Rigby</span> informed, that upon the Search in the <span class="hi">Savoy, Marshall</span> and <span class="hi">Corker</span> were both in bed, at the same time when <span class="hi">Pickering</span> was taken: and that the Company ask'd the Name of the people in the house; and that this Witness named to them <span class="hi">Pickering, Marsh, Corker,</span> and others.

And being ask'd, if ever she had seen Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> or Mr. <span class="hi">Bedlow</span> there in the house; she (the Witness) answer'd, that Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span> came to Mr. <span class="hi">Pickering</span> for a Charity that Summer was twelvemonth; and that Mr. <span class="hi">Pickering</span> forbad his coming into the house. Mr. <span class="hi">Marshall</span> collecting from that Evidence, that This being charg'd for the very Nick of time to advance the <span class="hi">Plot,</span> it was not probable that they would treat so necessary an Instrument in it at that rate. The Pri­soner repeating his desire onely of 3 or 4 days time, to provide his Wit­nesses: reasoning upon the Thing, that if his Life might justly be sav'd, he did presume that the Court would not have him lose it. But it was urg'd, on the other side, that he had notice long enough to have brought them up; and that the <span class="hi">Iury</span> must be now kept together till they give up their <span class="hi">Verdict.</span></p><p>Mrs. <span class="hi">Elizabeth Shelden</span> informed,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note480">Mr. <span class="hi">Stapilton</span> President of the <span class="hi">Benedic­tines,</span></span> that Mr. <span class="hi">Stapilton</span> was at present (and had been for four or five years last past, to her knowledge) President of, the <span class="hi">Benedictine Monks.</span> And <span class="hi">Alice Broadhead</span> informed likewise to the same effect. Upon which Evidence Mr. <span class="hi">Corker</span> raised this Inference, That Dr. <span class="hi">Oates</span>'s Accusation was of no validity, depending wholly upon the Prisoner's be­ing <span class="hi">President,</span> and consenting to the Plot under that qualification.</p><p>Sir <span class="hi">George Wakeman,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note481">The Priso­ners plead Innocence.</span> with a soleman Imprecation, disclaimed all the Crime in this matter that was charg'd upon him.
