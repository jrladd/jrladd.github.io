Whoever, through a manly and ſerious Application of his Mind, takes a juſt and an impartial View of himſelf, of all ſuch things as relate to and concern him, and accord­ingly governs his Will and Affections, determins his Be­haviour and Deportment; ſuch an one is a conſidera­tive Man.

If he communeth but with his own Heart, and acts according to the Illumination of his Under­ſtanding, to the Dictates of Reaſon and Convictions of Conſcience, if he ſeriouſly revolves in his Mind the Re­ward of Vertue and the Danger of Vice; in all pro­bability he will ſtand in Awe, and not ſin; he will have a care of affronting his God by wickedneſs and impiety; and this is the Benefit, this is the Advantage of Con­ſideration. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e396"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=4">[Page 5]</a></span> Alas! if we ſail without Chart, without Compaſs, without a Pilot, what can we expect but a fatal Shipwrack? If Men will not endeavour to diſpoſe themſelves to a ſerious Conſideration and Reflection upon what they are a going to do; but, as <span class="hi">the Horſe into the Battle,</span> ruſh upon things with Indiſcretion and Precipitancy; what can be the conſe­quence of ſuch their Folly, but Ruin and Deſtruction? It is the worthy Obſervation of <span class="hi">Philo, That the firſt rea­ſon of all the dangers and miſcarriages of Men lies in their running on with the boiſtrous Tide of Paſſion; and that the firſt hopes of ſafety flow from a ſober reaſoning of the matter.</span> But behold a greater than <span class="hi">Philo</span> is here: God himſelf lays the blame of all Men's Miſery upon Inconſideration. Thus God complains of his People, <span class="hi">Iſa.</span> 1.4. <span class="hi">Ah ſinful Nation, a people laden with Iniquity!</span> And why were they ſo? Why forſook they the Lord, and provoked him to Anger? It was becauſe of their heedleſneſs and Inadvertency: <span class="hi">Iſrael doth not know, my People doth not conſider,</span> verſ 3.

Such as heard it ſlightly and ſuperficially, ſuch as ſuf­fered it not to enter into their Mind and Conſideration: Without Conſideration it was impoſſible for it to take root and grow, or to digeſt into Principles of Action; ſome Seed, indeed, there was, which arriv'd to ma­turity and perfection, which was proſperous and fruit­ful; but the reaſon was, becauſe it was ſown in an ho­neſt and a good Heart; ſuch heard the Word and kept it, <span class="hi">i. e.</span> Retain'd it in their Thoughts and Conſiderati­on, <span class="hi">and ſo brought forth Fruit with patience, Luke</span> 8.12, 13, 14, 15.</p><p>But thus much of the Benefit of Conſideration: I come now to the third Obſervable, Namely, To ſhew you what is meant by the Latter End, which is the Ob­ject of the Conſideration here in the Text: <span class="hi">Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would con­ſider their latter end!</span> That is, as if he ſhould have ſaid, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e519"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=5">[Page 7]</a></span> Oh that they would ſee the things which belong unto their Peace! Oh that the Evil I forewarn them of, may deter them from avowed Wickedneſs and Impiety, may oblige them to a conſtant Living up to the Pre­cepts and Obligations of the Divine Laws! If not, Oh that the Judgments of God may convince them of their Errors, and reclaim their Sins, that they would ſtimulate and excite them to Repentance, to a due ſenſe▪ and conſideration what it is to ſin againſt God, to an underſtanding what will be the Event of perſiſt­ing in Wickedneſs, what will be the Reward of their Impenitence, both in this Life and the Life to come; ſo that by the Latter End is to be underſtood not on­ly Death, but, what follows after Death, <span class="hi">the Judgment,</span> an Appearance before the dreadful Tribunal of Al­mighty God, there to receive a Reward or a Puniſh­ment proportionable to what we have tranſacted upon the Stage of this World. Oh that all you, who hear me this day, would underſtand and con­ſider this great and certain Truth! <span class="hi">That it is not only appointed unto all men once to die, but after this the Judg­ment.</span> This is the import, this is the ſignification of the Latter End; Death is our Latter End, but the Reſurrection, the future Judgment is a Latter End beyond it. The Soul is of an immortal Nature, inca­pable of any Ceſſation, can never ceaſe to be; the Bo­dy muſt naturally die, it's noble Frame and admirable Contexture muſt be diſſolved and taken in Pieces, it muſt return to its original Duſt and Corruption; tho this is but a tranſitory and temporal Death, this is re­parable by a Reſurrection; it muſt certainly be rai­ſed again, and be re-united to the Soul, and ſhare with it in whatever ſtate or Condition it ſhall be ſen­tenced unto; if it hath not ſerved God, but the De­vil, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e559"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=6">[Page 8]</a></span> it ſhall then ſuffer a ſecond Death, after its re­unition to the Soul, they ſhall both be depreſs'd into a ſtate of Miſery, a State where are endleſs and eaſeleſs Torments; a Miſery, which is not Temporal or Tranſitory, but durable and permanent to all E­ternity, <span class="hi">and who can dwell with everlaſting burnings?</span> Whoſoever is wiſe will conſider this.</p><p>Men and Brethren, let me uſe the Strain of the Holy Apoſtle to <span class="hi">King Agrippa, Acts</span> 26.27. Do you believe the Scriptures? Do you believe a Reſurrecti­on, a Judgment to come? I know you believe it: May I ſay, I know you remember it? This I dare ſay, that if you do not, I know you have no cauſe not to remember it: A thing of the higheſt Impor­tance, a thing of the greateſt Concernment that ever will befall you, a thing that is moſt ſure and certain, a thing that you can as little avoid, as you can avoid Death, and a thing that muſt determin of your Eternal State, and do you not remember it? I am ſure we have all cauſe to remember it, we have all the reaſon imaginable to underſtand and conſider our Latter End.</p><p>If there be any here of a <span class="hi">Sadducean</span> Temper, that deny the Reſurrection; or, with the <span class="hi">Corinthian Na­turalist,</span> queſtion <span class="hi">How are the Dead raiſed up?</span> And <span class="hi">with what Body do they come?</span> Such are fooliſh and inconſiderate; ſuch Queſtions flow from Incogi­tancy and Indiſcretion, ſuch are horribly deceived; and they will find themſelves groſly miſtaken, for there will be a Reſurrection from the Dead: <span class="hi">God hath certainly appointed a day in the which he will judge the World in righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he he hath ordain'd, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e598"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=6">[Page 9]</a></span> all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead</span> Acts 17.31.

Now the <span class="hi">Four last things</span> to be continually remembred, are, <span class="hi">Death, a Judgment to come, Hell, and Celestial Glory.</span> And what more horrible than Death? What more terrible than ſuch a Judgment? What more intolerable than Eternal Fire? And what worthier Object can there be for us to exert our Fa­culties <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e667"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=7">[Page 10]</a></span> upon, than God and the Manſions of ever­laſting Felicity? How many Sins might we have a­voided in the courſe of our Lives, if we had had the ſerious remembrance and apprehenſion of theſe things? And how many Sins might we yet avoid, if we would but endeavour to have theſe things, as <span class="hi">Belſhazzar</span>'s <span class="hi">Hand-writing upon the Wall,</span> conſtantly in our Eye? Theſe things, <span class="hi">as the Pilot the Ship,</span> would direct and influence our whole Life and Converſa­tion, would help us to ſteer our Courſe, and ſafely bring us to the Haven of Bliſs and Happineſs. Such would be the great Advantage of conſidering our latter End: If Men would but thus conſider, no Temptation would then take hold of them, nothing would ruffle and diſcompoſe their Conſcience, it <span class="hi">would be void of Offence both towards God and towards Men.</span> But alas! In this lapſed and degenerate Age, in this miſerable and naughty World, how many are there that have languid, luke-warm and feeble Opinions of Religion? If Judgment may be formed according to their Vicious and immoral Converſation, what a Deluge of Prophaneneſs and Impiety, Atheiſm and Infidelity overflows this <span class="hi">Sinful Land, this poor Nation?</span> How many live, as tho they believed that Vertue and Vice, that God and the Devil were Words ſignifying nothing, as if they were the Ex­tract of ſome melancholy and pregnant Brain, as if they were invented meerly for Mens Terror and Affrightment? The <span class="hi">Halter,</span> the <span class="hi">Gibbet,</span> and the moſt terrible of Temporal Puniſhments too, have as little Influence upon Mens Lives, makes as ſmall an Impreſſion upon the Minds of Men, as thoſe which are Eternal: How many have ſuffer'd as <span class="hi">Murde­rers,</span> as <span class="hi">Thieves,</span> as <span class="hi">Evil-doers?</span> And yet Men will <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e711"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=43422&amp;page=7">[Page 11]</a></span> not take Warning and Example; Men will not be deterr'd from committing the like abominable, Vile and Enormous Offences. Every <span class="hi">Aſſize</span> gives us too many freſh and ſad Inſtances of this Truth. Oh that Men would become wiſe, and conſider not only Temporal, but Eternal Puniſhments! Such a Conſide­ration would, if any thing, oblige them to follow the important buſineſs of Religion, <span class="hi">To hurt no body by Word or Deed, to keep their hands from picking and ſtealing:</span> Such a Conſideration would enforce them to <span class="hi">labour truly to get their own living,</span> and to do their Duty in that Station which Divine Providence hath allotted to them.</p><p>There is not certainly a more effectual way to re­vive the <span class="hi">drooping Spirit</span> of Chriſtian Religion in the World, than ſeriouſly to contemplate upon, and conſider our Latter End, That we muſt ſhortly die, and come to Judgment, and there receive a Reward ac­cording to our Deeds.
