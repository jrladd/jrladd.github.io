And moreo­uer, our mortall complexion is yet ſubiect to many corporall infirmities, paſſions, and inordinate affections of the ſpirite. And ſo we paſſe away our dayes by continuall enterchange: as then ſicke, nowe, in health, then tich, nowe poore: then in hope, now in diſpayre: and now in diſcomfort, then in conſolacion. Therefore IOB, making familier compariſon, likeneth the beginnyng, the middes, and the end of mans lyfe, vnto a flowre.</p><p>For right as a flowre in the firſt appearance or ryſing is tender and feoble, and ſoone ouerthrowen, oppreſ­ſed, and conſumed and all be it that in the proceſſe of growyng, it ſpringeth and ryſeth pleaſantly, yet by al­teracion of Nyght and Day, mutabilitie of winde and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e420"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20425&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> weather, miſty Cloudes, and tempeſtious ayre. This foreſaid flowre is in continuall enterchange, and ſtan­deth neuer ſtable in one floriſhing ſtate any long time, but finally fadeth away, returnyng to very earth and powder.</p><p>Right ſo a man in the tender ſtate of his inno­cencie, is vnable to helpe him ſelfe, and to nouriſhe him ſelfe, in the neceſſitie of Nature he hath no ſuffi­ſaunce. Then growyng vp to Childhood, he is both feeble of corporall ſtrength, and weake in witte: and by caſuall chaunce of any int<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>mperancie, exceſſe, or ſurffet, he is ſoone quayled and brought to his ende. Then floriſhing and ſpringing vp to the ripenes (that is) vnto yeeres of diſcretion, portlines of ſtature, and perfection of manly ſtrength: he is apt to be poſſeſſed with many ſondry perils both ſpirituall and corporall, and vnder the chaunge of many fortunate chaunces.</p><p>And ſo concludingly, in decrepit aige he muſt neede ſuffer the impotencie thereof, and the miſerie of many ſore languors: and finally be ſequeſtred from this lyfe and worldly vanities thereof.

All be it, many worldly men labour and turmoyle them ſelues with weerineſſe in worldly tra­uels, waſtyng their dayes in meare vanitie. And carnall Creatures, blinded with ſenſuall appetites, lothſomely conſume their precious tyme, wherein they might at­tayne vnto knowledge and ſoules health, making no more accompt of loſt tyme (whiche is vnrecouerable) then as it were but of vyle price, and of no value.</p><div class="biblfree">BERNAR.</div><div class="q"><p>Nihil precioſius tempore: heu, nihil hodie vilius computatur.

For the knowledge of Scripture, by many rea­ſons, ſtrengthneth our Pacience, and geueth vs conſo­lation in all aduerſitie. VVherefore, the vnderſtanding of it to euery eſtate higher or lower, is both honora­ble, pleaſant, and profitable, as Caſſianus ſayth.</p><div class="q">Non aliqua in mundo potest eſſe fortuna, quam literarum non auget glorioſa notitia.</div><p>Yet notwithſtandyng, holy Scripture hath a ſpeciall prerogatiue beyonde all other doctrine, or prophane compiled matters.

Therefore, Dauid the Prince of Propphetes, ſayd.</p><div class="q">Declaratio ſermonum tuorum illuminat, &amp; in­tellectum dat paruulis</div><p>And by a groſſe compariſon, though all mertalles be good in their vſe, yet is there great diſtinction of degrees among them, and diuerſity of value: as Braſſe is more of price then Iron, Tynne, better then Leade, and Copper exceedeth Tynne▪ and one penny of ſil­uer, is worth ten of Copper: and one penny of golde, is vvorth ſeuen of ſiluer. Euen ſo is it among Treati­ſes, Lucubracions, and matters compoſed and compi­led: for they haue their diuerſitie and difference both in matter and maner of ſaying. And diuers degrees of goodnes maye bee founde in the ſame, As good, better, and all the beſt.
