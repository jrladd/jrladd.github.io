Well, wandering on further, <span class="hi">Mercury</span> eſpied where a company of Shoo-makers were at Dinner with powdred Beef and Breweſs; going to them, before he could ask them any alms, they ſaid, Welcom good fellow, what is thy Stomack up? Wilt thou do as we do, and taſte of our Beef? <span class="hi">Mercury</span> thanked them, and ſat down and eat his Belly-full, and drank well of Double-Beer; and when he had done, went home to his Maſter; as ſoon as he came, <span class="hi">Jupiter</span> asked him what news? And he ſaid, I have lighted amongſt a crew of Shoo-makers, the booneſt Fellows that ever I met withal, they have frankly fed me without grudging, and therefore grant me a Boon for them. Ask what thou wilt, <span class="hi">Mercury</span> (quoth he) and it ſhall be granted.
