## 1\. The Hiſtory of the Second Death OF THE RUMP.

To the Tune of, The Parliament ſate as ſnugg as a Cat.

I.

COme buy my fine Dity

Of News from the City,

As it was told in Devonſhire;

The Pimp that wipes weekly

Your Breech Politickly

Sells not ſo much Truth in a Quire.

II.

Tom Kings-man, near undone

With long ſtay in London,

Laſt week to the Country did gallop,

Where he took Cavaliers

With his News by the ears,

As they did the Pot to drink all-up.

III.

Quoth he. I once went

To th' late Parliament,

Whoſe Members (when I had ſeen 'em)

Made me think of a Rat,

That was caught by a Cat,

And eat up to the Tayl, that is venom.

IV.

But yet to the ſtump

Of that Poyſonous Rump,

Th' Old Mouth, did ſoder in ſeaſon;

And when that was done,

Like a Lay-Elder Gun,

It ſtunk at both ends of High Treaſon.

V.

The Monster did come

Of mere Mouth and Bum,

Moſt cunningly thus compacted,

That if queſtion'd it were,

For Miſchief done there,

It might ſwear, 'twas by No Body acted.

VI.

O' th' Nature and name

Of each Member that came,

Should I give a full relation,

You'ld gueſſe by the ſtink,

That I rak't in the Sink,

And Common-ſhore of the whole Nation.

VII.

Religious you might

Find all there, but the right;

For through the ſame Sieve they ran,

Which Noll us'd before

To ſift the Houſe 'ore,

Till nothing was left but the Bran.

VIII.

But of thoſe they had,

Diviſion being made

By Fortune's hand (which is uncertain)

Some Members got many,

Some few, ſome not any,

As Nevil complain'd, and Martin.

IX.

Indeed from Uſurpers

They freed us, and our—Purſe,

And prayſe of Thanks had been their hire,

For taking us than

Out o' th' Frying-pan,

Had they not caſt us into the fire.

X.

From Cromwell they voted

A Tyrant, though rotted,

Cauſe when they firſt footed their Game,

Hee'd not let 'em tarry

To prey on the Quarry,

But gorged himſelf on the ſame.

XI.

And King Oli-ver's Sons,

(Like Prince-playing Whore-ſons,

That on too high parts had ventur'd)

They ſtrip't with a hiſſe

Of their State-Properties,

And exeunt two Fools as they enter'd.

XII.

What elſe they do,

By our Purſes we knew,

As well as that ſcribling Knave Nedham;

Some good Laws they un-did,

And ſome bad they founded,

And ſhortned our Chain for our Freedom.

XIII.

To quell this fierce Monſter,

A Knight did anon-ſtir,

Who wanted Arms; yet from a Waggon

O' tho' Pope's hee'd take none,

But from Preſter-John,

And ſo St. George fell by the Dragon.

XIV.

Then Lambert's Wife chid him,

And (like Cromwell) bid him

Confound it, and mount the Throne royal,

Your Weapon's as long

Quoth ſhe and as ſtrong,

My ſelf of 'em both have made tryal.

XV.

He find's th' Anabaptiſt,

For his purpoſe aptiſt,

And treds the ſteps of Knipper Dolin,

He faſts, and he prays,

I'th' new canting phraſe,

As if heav'n were taken with drolling.

XVI.

Some Packs he inveagles,

O'th' blood-coated Beagles,

To's partie, the Rump-men did ſo to,

And victuall'd ſo well,

Th'adjaceut fort Hell,

As if they no other would go to.

XVII.

Little John thus did draw,

'Gainſt Robin th' Out-law,

(Good King) to try who ſhould have thy Deer,

And thus for both poyſons,

A quarrel did riſe once

Betwixt the foul Toad and the Spider.

XVIII.

Bold Lambert advanced,

He picquier'd, and pranced,

And's partie with ſpeeches did urge on,

But though he and Morley

Did ſnarl and look ſurly,

They cheated the De'il, and the Chirurgion.

XIX.

For ſoon the Red-coat,

(Who'l not fight, but Vote)

When Lambert's ſide ſtronger was found,

By (at leaſt) two foot,

And a Trooper to boot,

Did let the Rump fall to the ground.

XX.

And with General Leuthall,

The Houſe they ore went all,

Religion and Laws they ne're ſtood on,

But ſought ſtill to hold,

Ill got Land and Gold,

Which firſt made the Old Cauſe a Good one.

XXI.

So fell th' aged ſway,

Of five months and a day,

We yet ſee no heir apparent,

But from ſcabberd pregnant,

Expect Poſthume regnant,

If Midwife Monck kindly take care on't.

XXII.

The Sword-men addreſſe to's,

Pleas, and Manifeſtos,

Which ſhew 'em leſſe honeſt than crafty,

Whilſt a Tyrannous crew,

Our dangers renew,

That's call'd a Committee of Safety.

XXIII.

But Fleetwood and Whitlock,

(The Law's cunning Picklock)

With Salloway and Vane, two prime praters,

Lov'd Treaſon ſo well,

That agen to't they fell,

And betray'd ev'n their own fellow Traytors.

XXIV.

In's villany Bradſhaw,

Of conſtancy made ſhew,

For ſcorning Repentance as fickle,

His life he ſoon ended,

And to Hell deſcended,

This of my faith is an Article.

XXV.

Yet Politicus,

(The Deill's Succubus,

To teem for his commendation)

Advizes us all

To mourn, and we ſhall,

Whil'ſt that Hell-hound yelps in our Nation.

XXVI.

And now Lambert's Cohorts,

And Monk's (which makes woe hearts)

Do ſeem to conteſt, but anon,

We ſhip-wrack't ſhall be,

When they can agree,

From what Coaſt the ſtorm ſhall fall on.

XXVII.

Whilſt Buff and Red-coats,

Are ſanctifi'd notes,

Of Chriſt's, and his Goſpel's Protectors,

But 'mong themſelves ſolely,

Do they paſſe for Holy,

As Beſſus and's Sword men for Hectors.

XXVIII.

They that hear'd this ſtory,

Firſt ſigh'd, and were ſorry,

To hear to poor England's confuſion,

Then drank a full Bowl,

To that Royal ſoul,

That muſt ſettle all in concluſion.

> Vivat.

FINIS.
