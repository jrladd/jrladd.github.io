And, that which is an equall mischiefe, sets the sonnes of <span class="hi">Belial</span> on foot; and causes good fellowes (as they call them,) I meane brethren in iniquity, Ale-houses hunters, drunkards, and such refuse and riffe raffe of the Devil, to lift up their heads.</p><p>It is incredible to consider what a deale of hurt is done, and mischiefe many times wrought in­sensibly and unobservedly; when a wicked wit and wide conscience welds the sword of Authori­ty. For it is easie to a man so mounted, by Legall sleights, and pretence of deeper reach to com­passe his owne ends, either for promotion of ini­quity, or oppression of innocency. For the lat­ter; there is some truth in that Hyperbolicall speech of a great Moralist. <span class="hi">Let any man present me, saith hee, with the most excellent and blamelesse action, I will oppose it with so vicious and bad inten­tions, all which shall carry a face of likelihood.</span> What may he do then, who besides the habituall malice of his owne heart, and wit at will, hath power &amp; a pretended mystery of government, to plague a man with in this kind? Especially sith he knowes himselfe backt with that principle in pollicy. <span class="hi">It is not safe so to reverse transactions of State, though tain­ted perhaps with some manifest impressions of miscar­riage <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e500"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=5">[Page 3]</a></span> &amp; errour.</span> Woe therefore to those empoyso­ned stirrops, by which so many such servants rise aloft and climbe so high; I meane bribery, si­mony, flattery, temporizing, base insinuations, and such vile meanes. But I hope this Gangreu of going into Offices, Benefices, and high roomes by corruption, is not unhappily crept into this famous and florishing State; which if it should, it will eate so farre into the hearts and sinewes of the State, that no wit of man can foresee, into what basenesse and degenerations this noble Kingdome would fall in the next age: It would be the cause that many vines, olive-trees, and sig­trees should wither away in obscurity, and bram­bles brave it abroad in the world, wallow and tumble themselves in the pleasures, splendour, and glory of the times. But let such alone, this is their day: When they have blustered a while like mighty and boisterous winds, they breath out into naught. Their breath is in their nostrils, stop but their nose, and they are dead. Their big words are but as a vaine foame, &amp;c. If they be not humbled in their place, and repent, and turne the edge of their sword the right way, there is a day comming upon them, wherein they shall eate the fruit of their owne way, and be filled with their owne devices.</p><p>I have intimated now upon purpose, which way I would goe upon this latter part of the verse: <span class="hi">When the wicked beare rule the people mourne:</span> Because I shall not bee able at this time to reach it with a full discourse, I returne to the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e516"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=6">[Page 4]</a></span> first branch, wherein I will rest.</p><p><span class="hi">When the righteous are in Authority, the people rejoyce.</span> In these words we may behold Magi­stracy, Authority, Soveraignty, like a precious Diamond set in gold, I meane resting upon a righteous man, sparkling out, as its proper effect, amiable, noble and sweetest affection, that ever seaz'd upon the heart of man, joy, contentment, a pleasant sweetnesse of mind. Marke therefore three points in the proposition, First, Authority, secondly, its proper subject, A righteous man, thirdly, rejoycing, its native and kindly effect.</p><p>Soveraignety is sacred in it selfe; Authority even abstracted, is orient and illustrious. A ray, and representation of that great Majesty above.</p><p>It also ennobles the subject that receives it, with a remarkable splendour, and a kind of divine character. I have said you are Gods, <span class="hi">Psal.</span> 28.6. That is,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note10">See Sclater, pag. 8.</span> first, by Analogy, secondly, Deputation, thirdly, Participation. For you well know that besides that Imperiall Majesty, which is origi­nally and individually inherent in the person of a Monarchicall Soveraigne, there are also by deri­vation, or deputation, some markes and impres­sions of that princely endowment stampt, and shining in the face and presence of every subordi­nate Magistrate, which makes them venerable, especially those who give life and vigour, to the execution of their places, with the noblenesse of a free spirit, and clearenesse of a good cons­cience.</p><p>Lastly, it shining in it proper subject, a right­teous <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e550"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=6">[Page 5]</a></span> man, the true Sunne of Soveraignety, it dis­pels sadnes of heart, in which all objects of light­somenesse are drowned. The spirit of a man is broken, as <span class="hi">Salomon</span> saith, Prov. 15.13. As the beauty of a Pearle is dissolved in vineger, and be­gets joy in a world of people, which is one of the richest and royall donation, which this wide world can afford, nay and that which makes the effect more excellent, this affection of joy is by warrantable propriety, and true interest, onely peculiar and proper to honest and holy hearts. This jewell is onely for such gracious and gol­den Cabinets. No wicked or unregenerate man hath any true cause at all to rejoyce, laugh, or be merry. I will make it plaine in a word, even to the scorner. Suppose a great man convicted and condemned for treason, going towards the place of execution, a mile off; and let there a table be furnished all along with variety of dainties, let him tread upon violets, and roses, cloth of Ar­ras, cloth of gold, or what you will; all the way, let him be attended on both sides with most ex­quisite musicke, and honourable entertainments; doe you thinke all this will make him laugh hear­tily, carrying this in his heart, that he must loose his head at the miles end? I trow not. As farre lesse true cause hast thou to laugh, whosoever thou art, that goest on impenitently in thy sinnes, in swearing, drunkennesse, bribery, coveteous­nesse, pride, scorning godlinesse, or any other way of death, as a temporall death is easier then endlesse torments, for he is but going to loose his <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e573"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=7">[Page 6]</a></span> head, and thou art going towards hell.</p><p>Now then I collect in the first place this Do­ctrine.</p><p><span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note11"><span class="hi">Doct.</span></span>Doctr. Government is a goodly thing.</p><p>I conclude it thus out of the Text by good consequence.

And if it were visible to our bodily eyes, it would farre out shine the fairest, and most gli­stering Imperiall Crowne, that ever sate upon any <span class="hi">Caesars</span> head. It is so soveraigne, and certain­ly from GOD, that in case of Antinomy, that is, when Authority countermands where GOD hath commanded; we must refuse the will, but still reverence the power of a lawfull Magi­strate.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e633"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=7">[Page 7]</a></span>If the sword of Soveraignety, the exercise, and execution of power be bent against GOD, we must lay hold upon the Apostles Principle: <span class="hi">Whe­ther it be right in the sight of</span> GOD <span class="hi">to obey you rather then</span> GOD <span class="hi">judge yee.</span> And good reason, GOD is a Creator, man a creature, and in his hands are onely life and death; but in GODs, heaven and hell.</p><p>Between the Creatour and creature, there is no proportion, no comparison. Philosophy tells us, that betweene something and nothing, there is an infinit distance, the two ends, (if I might speake of infinite things,) of which immeasurable distance can never be brought together, but by an infinite being. Nothing can produce some­thing of nothing, but an Almighty nature. And therefore as there is an infinite distance betweene something and nothing, so there must also needs be an immeasurable disproportion betweene the Creating power, and that something created of nothing. And so by consequence the excellency, power, bindingnesse and soveraignety of the Creatours Law must needs surpasse and trans­cend above all degrees of comparison, and mea­sure of proportion that of the creatures.</p><p>You that are conversant in all parts of divine <span class="tcpmilestone">2</span> learning, and all those that are employed in the incomparable worke of the Ministery, ought to endeavour thereafter. For Ministers had never more need of learning then at this day; conside­ring with what variety and strength, the truth of GOD is opposed on all sides, by Atheisme, by <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e660"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=8">[Page 8]</a></span> Popery, that Hydra of all heresies, and other brainelesse exorbitancies about matters of Reli­gion. I say those that looke into Casuists and Schoole Divines, know how many degrees and kinds of lawes they make. First, There is the Law Eternall, resident in the pure, glorious, infinite mind of GOD, which is that order which GOD before all ages hath set downe with himselfe, for himselfe to doe all things by. 2. Then the Law of Nature, 3. Then the Law of Nations, Fourth­ly, then Humane Lawes. The first, is the cleare fountaine of all excellencies, order, and equity, as pure as GOD himselfe: these last passing tho­row the polluted channell of mans braine, are ca­pable of muddinesse, imperfection, and infirmi­ty. Who doubts then, but when we spy these last muddy streames to crosse the current of the di­vine Law, we must have recourse unto the well­head.</p><p><span class="tcpmilestone">3</span> Divine Lawes do bind the conscience primari­ly, as they say, properly, and by themselves. GOD is the LORD of the conscience, and onely able to damne and save the soule, for the breaking or keeping of his Lawes; and therefore he alone hath an absolute and soveraigne power to binde the conscience. If humane Lawes, even that are just, doe any way, it is by the power and precept of divine Law. See Rom. 13.1. &amp;c. I meane meerely humane. For that is false which <span class="hi">Bellar­mine</span> hath <span class="hi">De laicis,</span> Cap. 11. Par. 5. that every just Civill Law, is either a conclusion or deter­mination of the divine Morall Law. <span class="hi">Iunius</span> as all <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e697"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=8">[Page 9]</a></span> along in his Animadversions, so here, he hath al­so nobly conquered and confounded him. And therefore as we would preferre the keeping of a good conscience, before the sleeping in a whole skin, and the feare of him, which can destroy bon­dy and soule in hell fire, before him that can onely kill the body, let us cleave unto the commande­ments of GOD, against the contradictions of the whole world.</p><p>Yet notwithstanding the mis imployment, and the errour in the exercise of it, Authority is still venerable in the originall, and to be reputed GODs creature; else had <span class="hi">Daniel</span> never spoken thus to <span class="hi">Nabuchadnezzar,</span> an ungodly King and scourge of Nations.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note15">Dan. 2.37.</span> <span class="hi">Thou (O King) art a King of Kings, for the</span> GOD <span class="hi">of heaven hath given thee a King­dome, power, and strength, and glory.</span></p><p>And hence it is also,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note16"><span class="hi">De Civitate Deili.</span> 5.6, 21.</span> that <span class="hi">Austin,</span> that renow­ned Father tells us. <span class="hi">Hee that gave Soveraignety to</span> Augustus, <span class="hi">gave it also to</span> Nero. <span class="hi">Hee that gave it to the</span> Vespasians, <span class="hi">father and sonne, sweetest Emperours, gave it also to</span> Domitian <span class="hi">that bloody monster.

Let the heart in a man surcease from the exercise of its principality &amp; prime motion, and the wholebody would presently grow pale, bloudles and livelesse. If that glorious Giant in the sky, should retire his light into himselfe, and through a languishing faintnesse stay his course, and the Moone should wander from her beaten way, whom GOD hath appointed rulers over day and night; the times and seasons of the yeare would blend themselves, by dis-ordered and confused mixture. This good­ly frame of the world would dissolve, and fall into confusion and darknesse. Proportionably, take Soveraignety from the face of the earth, and you turne it into a Cockpit. Men would become cut-throats and Canibals one unto another. Mur­der, adulteries, incests, rapes, roberies, perjuries, witchcrafts, blasphemies, all kinds of villanies, outrages and savage cruelty, would overflow all Countries. We should have a very hell upon earth, and the face of it covered with blood, as it was once with water.</p><p><span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note18"><span class="hi">Reason</span> 3.</span>Thirdly, It giveth opportunity by GODs bles­sing, for the free exercise, and full improvement <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e796"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=9">[Page 11]</a></span> of all humane abilities, to their utmost worth and excellency. Trades, traffike, lawes, learning, wisdome, valour, policies of State, religion; all Arts and excellencies thrive and flourish with much happinesse and successe, under the wings and warmth of a godly government. Some shadowes of these notable and worthy effects appeared, even in the Heathenish State; as in that of the Ro­manes; to what a matchlesse noone tide of earth­ly glory and greatnesse; to what an incredible and uncomparable height of humane felicity did that people aspire, by managing their mysteries of State, and guiding the raines of their comman­ding power, by a faire, ingenious and noble hand, and that out of the meere illuminations of reason, and principles of naturall policy? But I must tell you by the way, they were notably assisted in this Imperiall rise, by their strict and severe lawes, against those two grand impoysoners of the strongest,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note19">See Godwin <span class="hi">de Ro.

There ever ought to be a convenient correspondency be­tweene the importance of the place, and the capa­city of the party. It is a thousand pitties to see in a Church, and Common-weale, many places full, and yet so few filled, when there is no pro­portion, nay a vast distance betweene the height, or rather the weight of the place, and the weake­nesse, worthlesnesse, if not the notorious wiked­nesse, of that unworthy person, who either by a golden violence, or temporising basenesse, hath most impudently thrust himielfe into it.</p><p>Secondly, <span class="hi">Wise, sapient men,</span> Such as are skil-full in the Theory, nature, mystery and meaning of the place, and Office into which they are to be preferred. A man can never happily execute, and successefully, any function, office, or Art, which is not learned in the speculative part, before he descend unto the practicke. Is it fit thinke you, for a man to plead at the Barre, before he hath well studyed, and profitably passed thorow the course of the Common-law?

There is a truth in the action, when there is a correspondency betweene a mans word, and deed; let me adde a fist, fittest for the present, to make you compleatly true.

Is such a companion like to lift up his voyce like a Trumpet, against the sinnes of the time, and stand at swords point against the severall corruptions, all the sinfull prophanations of his Parish, himselfe being a notorious delin­quent?</p><p>A Magistrate thus endowed, as the Scripture appoints, is a man after GODs owne heart, and a starre in his right hand; he that wants any of these is but a blazing Comet, how high soever he seemes to soare.</p><p>2.

For let men of the world which have their portion onely in this life, thinke, and say what they list, it is for the sakes, and safety of the Saints alone, whom they looke upon so disdainefully, themselves being extremely con­temptible, and would if they might have leave, trample them into the dust with the feet of pride &amp; malice, who ordinarily become the drunkards song, a by-word to men, viler then the earth, and Musicke at the tables of gracelesse great ones. I say, it is onely for them, that the mighty LORD of heaven, not onely supports and preserves, all the States, and Monarchies, all the Common­weales, and Kingdoms of the earth, but even the world it selfe. Assuredly, when the last of these Elected ones, whom GOD hath everlastingly loved from before all worlds, shall be called, converted, and fitted for heaven, the world shall stand no longer, but the heavens shall shrivell to­gether like a scrole, and passe away with a noise, the whole frame of this inferiour world, shall be turned into a ball of fire, the Imperiall Crownes of the greatest Monarchs upon earth, shall flame about their eares; you that carry now all before you, and wallow impenitently in the glory, plea­sure, applause, and wealth of the world, shall tire the rockes and mountaines with bootlesse cries, and intreaties to fall upon you, the Trum­pet will sound, and we shall all come to the Iudge­ment of that great, and last day.</p><p>This serviceablenesse, and subordination of all Imperiall, Regall, and inferiour power whatso­ever <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3707"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=38">[Page 68]</a></span> to the Kingdome of CHRIST, King <span class="hi">Iames</span> of famous memory, clearely intimates, and ac­knowledgeth in his Royall remonstrance, when he speakes thus: <span class="hi">To that</span> GOD, <span class="hi">that King of Kings I devote my Scepter, at his feeete in all humblenesse of spirit, I lay downe my Crowne, to whose service, as a most humble homager, and vassall, I consecrate all the glory, honour, splendor, and lustre of my earthly King­dome.</span> And what will become of all the power &amp; pollicy, that opposeth the people of GOD, we may see in the second of <span class="hi">Daniel,</span> ver. 34, 35, 44, 45. Those foure strongest Monarchies, and mightiest States, that ever the Sunne saw, shad­dowed by <span class="hi">Nabuchadnezars</span> great Image, setting themselves against the servants of GOD, were beaten upon, and blasted by the curse of divine wrath, and so sunke in their severall times, into the jawes of ruine, and irrecoverable desolation. They blustered a while like mighty winds with much threatning, and impetuous rage, but pre­sently breathed out into naught, and vanished for ever. <span class="hi">That stone,</span> saith the Text, <span class="hi">which was cut out without hands, smote the Image upon his feete, that were of yron, and clay, and brake them to peeces. Then was the yron, clay, the brasse, and silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and become like the chaffe of the Summer threshing flower, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them. And so let all the implacable enemies of</span> IESUS CHRIST <span class="hi">perish to the worlds end. Selah.</span></p><p>Thus you see what is the maine end of Magi­stracy: which necessarily requires righteousnes in Rulers. For</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3749"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=38">[Page 69]</a></span>A wicked Magistrate or Minister entering into this place, not by GODS doore, but by the De­vils window, as they say, which is ordinary with men of ill conscience; if they be of a medling and malignant humour, sense of his guiltinesse in comming in basely, and at a backe-doore, en­raging him, or the curse of GOD for his Symony or bribery justly hardning his heart; it is his wont to vexe and fall soule upon honest men, to stand for rotten causes, to take the worse part without repentance all the dayes of his domineering. But if he be of a duller, and more unactive spirit, and given to the world; he is resolved to medle as lit­tle as he may, to live reservedly, make a shew, grow rich, and there is an end; of what temper soever they be, if they feare not GOD, they are so farre from seeking his Kingdome, and right­eousnesse in the first place, that it is least, and lowest in their thoughts. Nay, doth not every spirituall eye see, that they are upon the matter close Agents, or publicke acto urs against the power, and holy precisenesse of it? Their see­king is themselves, their serving, is the time, their heaven is their high place. But now give me a godly man indeed, and as he would rather lye in the dust, all the dayes of his life, and dye in obscurity, then be advanced by any wicked, or unworthy meanes: So being pulled into any place of publicke employment, his holiest and highest desire, &amp; ambition is, to be as a refreshing comfortable shower in a great drought, to every honest man: but as a terrible tempest upon the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3762"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=39">[Page 70]</a></span> face of every sonne of <span class="hi">Belial,</span> and hairy-pate of every one that hates to be reformed, to stand no longer in his slipery place, then he may continue an upright industrious instrument to advance GODs glory, promote good causes, protect good men, ever most willing, rather to part with the highest promotion in the world, were it crowned with the riches and revenewes of all the Kingdomes upon earth, then with a good cons­cience. It was aright noble &amp; worthy answer, and exemplary of <span class="hi">Benevolus</span> to <span class="hi">Iustina</span> an Arrian Em­pres,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note98">Dike of Cons. pag. 140.</span> offering him preferment to be an instrument in some vile service; what, saith he, do ye promi­sing me a higher place for a reward of iniquity? Take this away, and welcome, which I have al­ready, so that I may keepe a good conscience: and thereupon threw at her feete his girdle, the ensigne of his honour. Thus undoubtedly will a good conscience trample under foote the highest preferment, to preserve its owne integrity.</p><p>Secondly, The righteous man onely will be thorowly, and universally resolute, for he knowes full well, and feeles, that he cannot possibly have any higher preferment then IESVS CHRIST, whom he already happily possesseth in the armes of his faith, nor any greater crosse then a wounded conscience, and therefore he dare by no meanes ei­ther hurt the one, or hazard the other. Hence it was that <span class="hi">Moses</span> casting the eye of his faith upon the recompense of reward, refused to be a favou­rite in <span class="hi">Pharohs</span> Court, and that <span class="hi">Ioseph</span> did so invin­cibly withstand the impure, and impudent sollici­tations <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3805"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=39">[Page 71]</a></span> of his wicked, and wanton Mistresse; he clearely foresaw what horrour was like to scaze upon his heart, by so sinning against his GOD. Now the reason that the righteous man is so re­solute; is the sense of his reconcilement to GOD, and the clearenesse of his conscience: and the cause that every wicked man is a coward, and will so conforme to the current of the time, is his ill conscience. <span class="hi">The wicked flee,</span> saith <span class="hi">Salomon, when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a Lion,</span> Prov. 28.1. The word in the originall signi­fies a young Lion, which as a Lion feares neither man nor beast, great nor small, he turneth not away for any. Prov. 30. But as young, by the fresh and furious boyling of his abundant, native heat, is more audacious, and undaunted for any adventure then other Lions, so lion-like bold, should every Magistrate be, for he must pull the prey out of the Lions mouth, and rescue the op­pressed from the man that is too mighty for him, he must not be afraid either of mortall, or immor­tall adversaries, he must not feare the face of man, or frownes of greatnesse, the losse of pre­ferment, present or promised: he must hold to the death, such principles as these: <span class="hi">Let Iustice be done, and let the heavens fall; if I perish, I perish; Should such a man as I flee, and bee faint-hearted? lively-hood, liberty, life, and all for a good cons­cience, &amp;c.</span> And so bold can a Ruler never be, unlesse he be righteous, and reconciled unto GOD. It is the comfort of a good conscience alone, which is able by a secret, and sacred in­fluence, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3832"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=40">[Page 72]</a></span> not onely to fill the body with marrow, and fatnesse, inspire the affections with a calme, and composed sweetnesse, but also begets in the spirit, that strong, and heavenly vigour, which inkindles, and keepes in life all such true courage, and noble resolution. There may be a brazen­face, and much foole-hardinesse without grace, but never a brave mind indeed, and spirit of steele. A wicked man advanced, and hoisted into some high place, may looke bigge, domineere, and give foule words, Nay, to be plausible, and please he may doe many good things, stand to it stoutly a good while; but bring him once to a strong temptation, or tryall, put him upon the push of the Pikes, and he will presently pull in the hornes, and start a side like a broken bow. He that is a slave to his lusts, and slavishly serves the time, will be sure to hide his head at the rising of every storme, and ever turne true coward, when his temporary happinesse is hazarded. And cow­ards as a worthy Divine hath characterized them, are slaves to their superiours, fellow-fooles to their equals, tyrants to their inferiours, and wind­mills to popular breath, not being able to any of these to say so much as, No.</p><p>Thirdly, unrighteous Rulers are the onely men to ruine a Kingdome: wicked Magistrates, and Ministers, are able in a short time to dis­solve the sinewes of the strongest State in Chri­stendome, and to bring the most flourishing Church of the world into confusion; Many wayes, is the measure of a peoples rebellion, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3846"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=40">[Page 73]</a></span> made up and full; ripe, and ready for the Sicle of GODs vengeance, and beesome of utter destru­ction; by many abominations is the LORDS in­dignation set on fire against a Nation, but I know not whether by any more, set Idolatry aside, then by perverting of Iustice: when judgement is tur­ned away backward, and Iustice standeth a farre off, when truth is fallen in the street. (Alas for pitty! where so many passe by, and not put to their helping-hand,) and equity cannot enter. O the LORD the righteous Iudge of all the world, is extremely angry, when judgement goes not forth, and Iustice is turned into gall, when those that sit in his place, either judge not at all, or judge unjustly, punishing the innocent, which should be cleared, and clearing the guilty who should be punished. When private men do wrong, the sinne is their owne, it is their personall of­fence, and they must answer it with their heads; but if private mens enormities and abominations passe unpunished, be borne with, or boulstred out by authority; if the wicked be justified, and the just condemned, if execution be not done upon <span class="hi">Achans,</span> if he be saved, whom GOD hath appointed to dye, if publicke power be villanous­ly abused to private revenge, profit, or pleasu­ring of great ones, if good Lawes be not executed for the protection of the innocent, and punishing of the wicked. In a word, if publicke Tribunals, and seates of Iustice, be any wayes corrupted, if Iustice that glorious ciment of all societies be ne­glected or perverted, if truth fall in the streete, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3867"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=41">[Page 74]</a></span> and equity grow lame, I say then the offence growes publicke, even the sinne of the whole Kingdome, and causeth GOD to enter into judge­ment, not with the Elders of his people, and Prin­ces alone, but with the whole Land, even with the State in generall.

Let us take notice, and tremble, <span class="hi">Iudge­ment is turned away backward, and Iustice standeth a farre off; for truth is fallen in the streete, and equity cannot enter.

Besides the concurrent judgement of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3975"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=42">[Page 77]</a></span> those uncomparable, and renowned Divines in Queene <span class="hi">Elizabeths</span> time, our present orthodoxe Divines, and Doctours, apprehend aright and ac­knowledge the infinite antipathy and utter im­possibility, speaking thus; <span class="hi">Roma</span> is <span class="hi">irreconciliabilis,</span> saith the Bishop of Exceter: Light and darknesse may meete, saith another, in the twilight, but mid-day and mid-night can never possibly come together; and such is Popery, and Protestancy.

It is great pitty, so goodly a body should want a soule.</p><p>And it must needs be so, by that observation from men of best conscience, greatest worth, and deepest understanding, and noblest parts, if truly sanctified unto them are most unambitious, loth to rise, and fearefull ever to enter upon, and un­dertake any publike charge. A modest under-va­luing of themselves, an ordinary attendant upon true worth, sensiblenes of the burthen, doubtfulnes of a thorow discharge of the place, fearefulnesse of being ensnared, and overcome by temptations, a right apprehension and fore-conceit of the great account, &amp;c. easily take them off from too much forwardnesse, coole their courage for over eager pursuit, and quite extinguish all ambitious heate; nay, many times thereupon, they draw backe, and retire. A rare thing in this age, but former times afford many examples.</p><p>It is reported of father <span class="hi">Austin,</span> a man of more incomparable learning then thousands that thinke themselves worthy of a Bishopricke, that he would runne from those Cities which wanted Bi­shops, least they should lay hold upon him.</p><p><span class="hi">Nazianzen</span> having all the voyces heaped upon him, stoutly refused the advancement, and at the length, saith the story, very hardly after many in­treaties, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4857"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=52">[Page 96]</a></span> and perswasions of the Emperour yeel­ed.</p><p>Great <span class="hi">Basil</span> was hald into the Bishoprike with much adoe: <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note123">See the Ar­gument before <span class="hi">Chrysost. De incerdot<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o.</span></span> <span class="hi">Chrisostome</span> hid himselfe, and desi­red to be excused. And this their practise is an­swerable to the principle intimated before; That men of honesty, and sufficiency are more sensible of the burthen, carefull of the charge, and appre­hensive of the account, then affected with the honour, or in love with standing in a slippery place.</p><p>These Fathers that feared these great charges, were resolved to preach every day, twice a day sometime thrice a day; and they did take to heart aforehand that account, they must give for the soules commited to their charge: the terrour of that commination, saith <span class="hi">Chrisostome,</span> Heb. 13.17. For they watch over your soules, as they that must give account, makes me quake and tremble. From such grounds as these, men of innocency, and true worth, especially enjoying the comforts of a good conscience, and communion with IE­SUS CHRIST, are well enough content to con­tinue in a private estate, and would not willingly stirre, except by a direct and comfortable calling, GOD would have them to doe him service, in a more publicke employment, and higher place; and they ordinarily undertake them with much feare, selfe-distrust, and extraordinary prayer. Full little doe you know, who in the meanetime stop the cries of your guilty consciences with gold, good-fellowship or great place, what <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4897"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=52">[Page 97]</a></span> the pleasures of an appeased conscience are; had you ever truly tasted their sweetnesse, and sound­ly smarted with the anguish of a troubled one in conversion, I dare say you would not by your good wills wound it for a Kingdome, for a world. A good conscience (saith one well) is of the same mind with the trees in <span class="hi">Iothams</span> Parable <span class="hi">Iudges 9.</span> It will not with the Olive loose its fatnesse, nor with the Fig-tree loose his sweetnesse, nor with the Vine, its wine of chearefulnesse, to have the fattest, and sweetest preferments, and pleasures of the world: no though it were to raigne and do­mineere over all the trees in the forrests. One­ly the Bramble as you know, the most base, and contemptible, a dry saplesse kexe and weed, will needs up into a high roome. Weake, and worth­lesse men, ordinarily are the onely men, old ex­cellent, as they say, most active, and pragmati­call to serue themselves by bribes, and base tricks into benefices, Offices, and other undeserved pla­ces of preferment. For they want honest wit to conceive &amp; fore-see the waight of the charge, and conscience to discharge it faithfully, their onely aime, and aspiration out of an ambitious itching humour, is to advance their owne particular pri­vate ends, &amp; although they be many times as emp­ty of all true worth, as the vainest Idoll, yet they desire to sit aloft, and be adored above others. Though they may take some directions, and mo­tives from the grounds of reason, and light of naturall conscience, to deale honestly and inge­niously in their places, yet for a thorow univer­sall, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4932"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=53">[Page 98]</a></span> unshaken stoutnesse and integrity in the dis­charge of them; let them principally be enlight­ned, guided, quickned, by the supernaturall principles of divine truth, and dictates of a cons­cience sprinkled with the blood of CHRIST, and sanctified by speciall grace.</p><p>The ordinary temptations to which the pro­fession of Lawyers is sometime subject, are such as these.</p><p><span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note124"><span class="hi">Iust as advoca­tus injustus ciui­sas nullo mo lo suscipit.</span> Greg. <span class="hi">Hom. 8. in</span> Eze­chi.</span>First, Patronage of bad causes, which they know out of their Legall skill, and in their owne consciences are rotten at the roote, and will prove naught at the last. 2. Pleading against the right. 3. Mercenary silence. 4. Wire-drawing their Clients suites for their owne advantage, using causes, as unconscionable Surgeons doe sore legs, hold them long in hand, not for the difficulty, but for the gaine of the cure. 5. Ta­king unreasonable fees. 6. Tampering about their Law buisinesse upon the LORDS day. 7. Re­ceiving the fee, and not speaking in the Clients cause. The last of which, I could never yet be­leeve of any: because in my conceit, for any thing I know, he might as well take their swiftest horse, and keenest sword, and lye by the high-wayes for a rich usurer, or wealthy clothier: what? to sell so much as in them lyes, to a poore man the ruine of his lively-hood, for his owne peece of gold! where is the valuable consideration so much talked of? nay unvaluable is the wrong, whereas if they had not trusted in him, he might perhaps have prevented the mischiefe.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4969"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=53">[Page 99]</a></span>But for my purpose to instance in two of them, pleading for a bad, and against a good cause, are both upon the matter, and in plaine English, lying against the truth.</p><p>Now if any palliate and pretend, that an offi­cious lye, especially accompanied with so much gaine, is no such great matter. Let them looke then upon the light of sounder reason, which in­forced the very heathen Philosopher <span class="hi">Aristotle,</span> to affirme that a lye is <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, evill <span class="hi">per se,</span> in it owne nature, and therefore no consideration, circumstance, or Religion can possibly legitimate it; but it is still a base and loathsome vice. But principally let them cast their eye upon GODs blessed Booke, and tremble and be for ever frigh­ted from all false dealing in this kind, by such places as these. <span class="hi">Isa.</span> 5.20. Woe unto them that call evill good, and good evill, &amp;c. Rev. 21.8. All Lyers shall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the se­cond death.</p><p>Iudges may be accessary to blood-shed two wayes, especially if they doe it knowingly, and swayed away by by-respects. 1. By condemning the innocent, which is cleare, and 2. By letting the guilty escape, which appeares by GODs owne words, 1 Kings 20.42. Because thou hast saved him whom I appointed to dye, thy life shall be for his life, &amp;c. And by that Advocates speech to a Iudge in Germany, aggravating the fault of a murtherer, that had killed sixe men, No my Lord, saith he, he hath killed but one, you are <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4998"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=54">[Page 100]</a></span> guilty of the blood of the other five, because you let him escape upon the first murther. Now in this case let them take a curbe, and restraint from consideration, that the very heathens, to sha­dow out their torment, did faine hellish furies to follow such hainous offenders with burning fire­brands, &amp;c. But especially let the Booke of GOD beate them off, from any tainture that way. Amongst many others, that place, Numb. 35.33. is able to pierce an heart of adamant, where the Spirit of GOD tell us, that besides personall guilt, blood involves, even the whole Kingdome in the staine and mischiefe: for blood, saith he, de­fileth the Land, and the Land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. I intend nothing in these last passages, to the prejudice, or offence of any. For my part I honour the reuerent Iudges, and wor­thy Lawyers of this Land, at this day, as one of the noblest limbes of the State. And I cannot but looke upon the Lords my Iudges, with more then ordinary respect, for Iustice <span class="hi">Nicols</span> sake, my wor­thy Patron, that reverend and renowned Iudge, whom I honour in the dust. And yet for all this, I must tell you the truth, deale plainely I must and will, from this place, in this place, though I should dye in it.</p><p>Me thinkes the very providence of reasonable men should move you that are Magistrates, in this and other corporations, to relieve your poore with the forfeitures of oathes, and Ale-houses: But when you have besides GODs blessed Law, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5016"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=54">[Page 101]</a></span> so mighty against drun<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ards, blasphemers. And that King <span class="hi">Charles</span> also hath so graciously confir­med those blesed Acts provided in that case, to sharpen the sword, and strengthen the arme of Authority for that purpose, you ought to be ex­traordinarily vigilant, active, and conscionable in the execution of them, otherwise assure your selves, you rob GOD of his honour, the King of his service, and the poore of their almes, and your selves of good consciences. And this foure­fold cord without repentance, and quickning, is able to bind the curse of GOD fearefully to the consciences of t<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>ose which should be faulty this way. I charge none in this point, but onely them, whose consciences if they will give them leave to speake out, ma<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> justly accuse; if any of your hearts should condemne you, GOD is greater then your hearts, and will pay you home: be not de­ceived, nor flatte your selves with any ungroun­ded selfe conceit. It is a principle, even in morall policy, that an ill executour of the Lawes is worse in a State, then a great breaker of them. Not to punish an offence,<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note125"><span class="hi">Calvina. lib 2. pag. 249.</span></span> being under your charge, and in your power, is <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o commit it.</p><p>We that are Ministers, and called Rectours, are bound, and may b<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> stirred up by the grounds of common equity to feed the flocke, if we take the fleece; to give spirituall things, where we have temporall.</p><p>But that dreadful charge of <span class="hi">Paul</span> to <span class="hi">Timothy,</span> 1 <span class="hi">Tim.</span> 4.1. is able to trouble, and affright ever a <span class="hi">Chrysostome,</span> a <span class="hi">Calvin,</span> who preached every day, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5079"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=6599&amp;page=55">[Page 102]</a></span> and such others illustrious lights, and earthly Angels, for powerfull, and plentifull preaching; what terrour and trembling then should it put in­to the hearts, (if they be not turned into rocks,) of silken, seldome, negligent, and no-Preachers? <span class="hi">I charge thee before</span> GOD, saith <span class="hi">Paul, and the</span> LORD IESUS CHRIST, <span class="hi">who shall judge the quicke and the dead, at his appearing, and his Kingdome.
