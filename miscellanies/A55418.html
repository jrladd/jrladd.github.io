For inſtead thereof we had a long Circumlocution, condemning the Noble Science of Aſtronomy, and all it's Speculations; although I eſteem him no competent Judge of any matter whereof he hath not ſome knowledge; and conſequently a too bold ſentencer of it. That there may be Predictions learnt from that Siderial School is undeniable; being conſonant to the judgment of all Antiquity. The reading of <span class="hi">Jeru­ſalem</span>'s Ruin among the Stars, preceded the ac­compliſhment many years.

And this Year many ſhall go ſober into Taverns, where, by a certain <span class="hi">Me­tamorphoſis,</span> they come out Mad. This Year ſhall be dub'd many Ale-quaffers into fellowſhip with that ancient and much deſir'd Order of <span class="hi">Red-Roſes.</span> Likewiſe, This Year ſhall be born many ſtrange Children, that when they come to Age, will be ſo ignorant that they ſhall not know their own Fa­thers. And whereas the Eclipſe of the Moon this Year is ſhort; it ſignifies to us that Womens love ſhall be very ſhort and Momentary; inſomuch that hereupon divers great ſtorms ſhall happen, and many loud Winds, together alſo with incredible Hail­ſtones, (no leſſer than Joint-ſtools) ſhall fall upon Mens heads.</p><p>I portend alſo, that ſundry other Occurrences ſhall happen; Many ſtrange and woful Diſeaſes ſhall Raign: as <span class="hi">hollowneſs of the Heart, infirmities of the Tongue;</span> ſo that, that Member ſhall play the Harlot, and lie with all Men.</p><p>Moreover alſo, I foretel to thoſe <span class="hi">Patient Things,</span> whoſe Wives are as <span class="hi">light</span> as their Weights, that they ſhall be troubled with great ſwellings in the Brows, and unleſs that Diſtemper be met and prevented, it will certainly break out into that pain­ful Diſeaſe of the <span class="hi">Horn-Cholick.</span> Likewiſe by rea­ſon <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e334"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=52895&amp;page=4">[Page 5]</a></span> of the abounding of Cherries, Plums, and other ſtony-fruit this Year; by eating thereof many Men ſhall be troubled with a Diſtemper of ſuch a Nature as none can cure but Cunning Women.</p><p>I Predict further; many Citizens, Sailors, Ad­vocators and others, ſhall have great luck in Hunt­ing: for though the Game be too quick of foot which they follow, yet going homewards, they ſhall have the fortune to meet with ſome deſireable Purchaſe.</p><p>Likewiſe, This Year I infallibly Prognoſticate that Silver ſhall be dearer than Tin, and Gold more precious than Lead; and, as it is thought by ſome, ſo much ſcarcity of either, that a whole Teem of Knights of the Poſt ſhall not be able to draw <span class="hi">100l.</span> through <span class="hi">Cheapſide,</span> without the help of a ſubſtantial Fore-horſe.</p><p>And laſtly, I Prognoſticate, That Hens, Capons, Geeſe, and ſuch Dainties, ſhall little haunt poor Mens Tables this Year; but fly quite away to fat Churls Houſes. And for thoſe Miſers, although few things concern them in this Propheſie, yet let me give them this <span class="hi">Caveat,</span> That having Clothes enough, they keep themſelves warm; and having Coals enough, they provide good Fires; and having a liberal Purſe, they go to Bed always with a Cup of <span class="hi">Malaga;</span> and having a good Wife, they make much of her: and then for ought I can perceive by my skill, they are like to live as long as they can, though not ſo long as they would; and not die one hour before their time.</p></div><div class="trailer">THE END.</div></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Poor Robin..
