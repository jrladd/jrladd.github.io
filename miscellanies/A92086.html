And let other ſinners that love a whole Skin,</div><div class="l">Keep out of my reach, for fear of a Stone;</div><div class="l">For I'm like the Hang-man, who (when's hand was in)</div><div class="l">Said he had as good truſs up fourty as one.</div><div class="l">3. Firſt I'le tell you whence this <span class="hi">Rump</span>-regnant came,</div><div class="l">When <span class="hi">England</span> to Faction and Schiſm was bent,</div><div class="l">By means of long peace to ſettle the ſame,</div><div class="l">Our noble King ſummon'd a Parliament.</div><div class="l">4. A Parliament which may make old men grieve,</div><div class="l">And Children that ne're ſhall be born complain;</div><div class="l">I mean ſuch as dy'd before they did live,</div><div class="l">Like <span class="hi">Harrington</span>'s <span class="hi">Rota,</span> and th' Engin of <span class="hi">Vane.</span></div><div class="l">5. This Parliament, like a wild skittiſh Tit,</div><div class="l">Unman'd and unback't, and unapt to obey,</div><div class="l">Would let neither Prince, Peer, nor Prelate ſit,</div><div class="l">Yet ſtammell nos'd <span class="hi">OLIVE<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span></span> ſmelt out a way.</div><div class="l">6. With Piſtol and Muſquet he brought the Beaſt under,</div><div class="l">And aw'd<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>it ſo much, and ſo far did prevail,</div><div class="l">That camely he dock't it, and (to all mens wonder)</div><div class="l">He caſt off the Colt, and ſadled the Tail:</div><div class="l">7. Which ſhortly began to kick at's Command,</div><div class="l">And reſtive it grew, and left its true pacing,</div><div class="l">Which made him reſolve on his own Legs to ſtand,</div><div class="l">And turn the <span class="hi">RUMP</span> out of the Stable a graſing.</div><div class="l">8. The Red-coats, with breath like my Ladys Bum-blaſt,</div><div class="l">This Parliament-ſnuff blew twice out and in:</div><div class="l">But North and Weſt-winds will ſo out it at laſt,</div><div class="l">That nought but Hell fire ſhall out it agen,</div><div class="l">9. Though now they tempt <span class="hi">Monk</span> with a thouſand <span class="hi">per annum</span></div><div class="l">In hopes that to worſhip, his face hee'l fall flat on;</div><div class="l">Yet he's wiſe enough to reſiſt and diſdain 'em,</div><div class="l">And cry, <span class="hi">Get behind me, thou Bob-tail of Satan.</span></div><div class="l">10. Right pat with St. <span class="hi">Georg</span>'s this ſtory will jump,</div><div class="l">Poor <span class="hi">Englands</span> the Damſel appointed for ſlaughter,</div><div class="l">And <span class="hi">Monk</span> the St. <span class="hi">George</span> to kill Dragon <span class="hi">RUMP,</span></div><div class="l">And ſafely reſtore to the King his fair Daughter.</div><div class="l">11. The <span class="hi">RUMP</span> thus in groſs no more ſhall be plaid on,</div><div class="l">But now I will whet my Pen (if it pleaſe ye)</div><div class="l">To joynt it, and ſhew what foul parts it is made on,</div><div class="l">God grant that your ſtomachs prove not over-queaſie.</div><div class="l">12. Here's <span class="hi">Lenthall</span> once Mouth to the Parliament's mind,</div><div class="l">Though he at length acted the Fundaments part,</div><div class="l">Whoſe ſpeech was not breaking of ſilence, but Wind,</div><div class="l">And's giving the <span class="hi">Thanks</span> of the Houſe, but a Fart.</div><div class="l">13. 'Tis ſaid he's now ſick, and if't be the <span class="hi">POX,</span></div><div class="l">I'de wiſh him in time his Diſeaſe to diſcloſe,</div><div class="l">And call Dr. <span class="hi">Ba<span class="gap" title="•…"> [...]</span>s,</span> who's ex'lent at Nocks,</div><div class="l">Although his skil failed him in his own Noſe.</div><div class="l">14.

But if his Gold-greedy Soul wil be gon</div><div class="l">Out at Poſtern Gate, he hath 'mong his Wayters</div><div class="l">At Cat-in-pan Pedant the way to make known</div><div class="l">To th' General Rendezvous of all Traytors.</div><div class="l">16. But many I find this Opinion are firm in,</div><div class="l">That he has no real diſtemper at all,</div><div class="l">But feigns it; and like a prophetical Vermin,</div><div class="l">Runs from an old Houſe that is ready to fall.</div><div class="l">17. If <span class="hi">Ludlow</span> the ſtate of Grace had been in,</div><div class="l">And kept himſelf ſafe fro' th' Committee of Safety,</div><div class="l">For's Fathers ſake, Deputy Fart he had been,</div><div class="l">Inſtead of the <span class="hi">F<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>rſt,</span> they call <span class="gap" title="〈◊〉"> [...]</span> the G<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>afty.</div><div class="l">18. Next comes the <span class="hi">Rump</span>'s God-flye, the <span class="hi">John</span>-like driver,</div><div class="l">King-abjuring <span class="hi">ARTHUR;</span> Sir, you (if I ken you)</div><div class="l">O'th' Biſhop's <span class="hi">Vriah</span>-like fall were Contriver,</div><div class="l">To get the fair <span class="hi">Berſheba</span> of their Revenue.</div><div class="l">19. But 'twas a more carnal concupiſcence</div><div class="l">That at <span class="hi">Briſtol</span>-Vicaridge ſet you a neighing,</div><div class="l">Which you enjoyd and occupyd in the ſence</div><div class="l">Which puts-pretty Maids to piſhing and fying.</div><div class="l">20. Nay you like the <span class="hi">Trojan</span>-Adulterer ſwore</div><div class="l">To thoſe that once ſaved you from the Kings Fury,</div><div class="l">That rather then <span class="hi">Helen</span> of <span class="hi">Dureſm</span> reſtore,</div><div class="l">Their <span class="hi">Troynovani</span> in its own aſhes you'd burn.</div><div class="l">21. But I dare no farther his paſſion provoke</div><div class="l">For fear of a prejudice which it may do me,</div><div class="l">For with his own Choler ſhould he chance to choke,</div><div class="l">The Hang-man in Action of Treſpaſs might ſue me.</div><div class="l">22. Then have at Sir <span class="hi">Harry</span> the Int'reſt Refiner,</div><div class="l">Who's not of the Church, but Society of JESUS,</div><div class="l">And can make Divinity's ſelf-Diviner,</div><div class="l">And model new Heavens and new Earths to pleaſe us.</div><div class="l">23. Twas he that injected the ſublimed matter</div><div class="l">To late-Lady <span class="hi">Lambert,</span> and ſhe to th' Squire,</div><div class="l">Which made him Protector and Parliament-hater,</div><div class="l">And to be <span class="hi">Fift Monarch</span> devoutly aſpire.</div><div class="l">24. Like Grub from Sheeps tayls ſince the <span class="hi">Rump</span> doth him throw,</div><div class="l">He'le creep to ſome placket of Sanctification,</div><div class="l">And come forth a Fleſh-flye next Summer, and blow</div><div class="l">New Maggots in's Church, of more whimſical faſhion.</div><div class="l">25. Methinks in his eyes the Waters do gather,</div><div class="l">As if the Lord <span class="hi">Staffords</span> Duſt troubled his ſight;</div><div class="l">Perhaps he repents, and intends (like his Father)</div><div class="l">Ev'n in his own Garter to do his Ghoſt right.</div><div class="l">26. There goes the twice treacherous Banquerout <span class="hi">Sallaway</span></div><div class="l">From <span class="hi">Weſtminſter</span> Wolves, to <span class="hi">Tow'r</span> Lions bound,</div><div class="l">Cauſe he from one Treaſon to another did fall away,</div><div class="l">And wil fall again, but not quite to the ground.</div><div class="l">27.
