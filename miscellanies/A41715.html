In him (<span class="hi">meaning the Divine Word</span>) was Life, and the Life was the <span class="hi">Conſcience</span> of Men: And the <span class="hi">Conſcience</span> ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not. There was a Man ſent from God, whoſe Name was <span class="hi">John,</span> the ſame came for a Witneſs, to bear witneſs of the <span class="hi">Conſcience,</span> that all Men through him might believe. He was not that <span class="hi">Con­ſcience,</span> but was ſent to bear witneſs of that <span class="hi">Conſcience:</span> That was the true <span class="hi">Conſcience,</span> that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World. <span class="hi">John</span> 8. 12. I am the <span class="hi">Conſcience</span> of the World, he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the <span class="hi">Conſcience</span> of Life. <span class="hi">And alſo,</span> 1 John 1. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.
