Firſt hee muſt be a diuine, that is, he muſt be diuinelie giuen, he muſt aboue all things ſerue God, that God may bleſſe him, in all his good indeuoures; hee muſt read the ſcriptures, for it is the fountaine of all knowledge, &amp; it teacheth the diuine harmonie of the ſoule of man: for Muſicke is none other then a perfect harmonie, whoſe diuinitie is ſeene in the perfectneſſe of his proportions, as, his vniſon ſheweth the vnitie, from whence all other, (concords, diſcords, conſonancies, or others whatſoeuer) ſpringeth, next his vnitie, his third: (which is the perfecteſt concord that is in all Muſicke) repreſenteth the perfect, &amp; moſt holie Trinitie; his fift, (the moſt perfect conſonance in all Muſicke, for that it is the verie eſſence of all con­cords) repreſenteth the perfection of that moſt perfect number of fiue, which made the perfect atonement, betweene God, and man; His eight, (which as it is, but as his vniſon,) repreſenteth his <span class="hi">Alpha</span> and <span class="hi">Omega:</span> &amp; as what is aboue his eight, is but as a repetition, as from his vniſon, as it were a new beginning; ſo it ſhew­eth our returne from whence we came, as it were, in notes of Muſicke, in a long or ſhort time, ſweet or ſowre compoſition, and thus, (I hope, without offence to that moſt holie <span class="hi">Alpha</span> and <span class="hi">Omega)</span> I conclude, the ne­ceſsitie of diuinitie in a Muſition. Now that a Muſition ſhould bee a Phiſition, I ſee no ſuch neceſsitie, But that Muſicke is Phiſical, it is plainlie ſeene by thoſe maladies it cureth. As it cureth melancholie; it much pre­uaileth againſt madneſſe; If a man be in paines of the gout, of any wound, or of the head, it much mittigateth the furie therof: and it is ſaid, that Muſicke hath a ſalue for euerie ſore.
