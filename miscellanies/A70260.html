The more dreadful the Sin is, the more fearful we muſt be, in charging it upon any ſpe­cial crime, or particular perſon. In defining a ſin of ſo heynous a nature, direct and evident proof <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e270"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=4">[Page 2]</a></span> from Scripture is requiſite. It is not enough to conſider, (as many do) what ſins are moſt deſperate and deadly, and therefore to conclude ſuch ſins are againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Thus indeed the School­men have done, who have made ſix differences of this ſin, V. in fine. without any ground or warrant from Scripture for ſo do­ing. And <span class="hi">Bellarmine</span> is ſo liberal in beſtowing on ſuch as he calls Hereticks, that his opinion is, that a Man can ſcarce be a learned Pro­teſtant, without committing the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Neither are the Papiſts the only Men that are miſtaken about this ſin: but too many Divines of the Refor­med Churches, have ſtarted aſide from the Scripture, and have gi­ven us ſuch intricate and contra­dictory <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e288"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=4">[Page 3]</a></span> definitions of this ſin, as tend only to the perplexing the tender Conſciences of weak Chri­ſtians. To make good this Cen­ſure, I will briefly ſet down ſo much touching this ſin, as I con­ceive is warranted by the Word of God, and humbly ſubmit to the judgment of the Learned.</p><p>The Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, was an evil ſpeak­ing of, or ſlandering of the Mi­racles which our Saviour did, by thoſe, who though they were con­vinced by the Miracles, to believe that ſuch Works could not be done, but by the power of God, yet they did malitiouſly ſay, they were wrought by the power of the Devil.</p><p>In this Definition, theſe points are obſervable.</p><p><span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e309"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=5">[Page 4]</a></span>1. I forbear to call it the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but the Blaſphemy; for though every Blaſphemy be a ſin in general, yet our Saviour Chriſt, terms it the Blaſphemy. And the Evan­geliſts do all agree, to give it the ſame term: and 'tis now here in ho­ly Scripture called the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and yet it appears both in <span class="hi">St. Mathew</span> and <span class="hi">St. Mark,</span> that there was juſt occaſion offe­red to our Saviour to call it ſo; where he compares it with the ſin againſt the Son of Man; but he forbears to call it any thing, but the Blaſphemy; thereby, no doubt, to teach us, it conſiſteth only in curſed ſpeaking and Blaſ­pheming. A ſerious conſide­ration of this point, may teach us ſo much moderation, as to <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e328"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=5">[Page 5]</a></span> confine our ſelves to that term which our Saviour in the three Evangeliſts hath preſcribed unto us. I cannot find that any Man that hath writ upon this Argu­ment, hath made any obſervati­on, or noted this phraſe and term uſed by the Evangeliſts, in pro­nouncing the dreadful ſentence of our Saviour againſt the Blaſ­phemy of the Holy Ghoſt, I will cite theſe Texts, where it is named, <span class="hi">Math.</span> 12. 31. <span class="hi">Mark</span> 3. 28▪ <span class="hi">Luke▪</span> 12▪ 10.</p><p>2. A ſecond Obſervation is, That Blaſphemy is a ſpeaking againſt another, as both <span class="hi">St. Ma­thew</span> and <span class="hi">St. Luke</span> expound the word, for in the Original, it is a blaſting the Fame, or <span class="hi">blaming</span> of another; for from the Greek word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> both the <span class="hi">French</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e379"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=6">[Page 6]</a></span> Nation and our <span class="hi">Engliſh</span> by con­traction have made the word blame.</p><p>3. To paſs from the Name to the Thing it ſelf, we may obſerve by the coherence of the Texts, that Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, was ſpoken of by our Sa­viour, concerning the Scribes and Phariſees. It was (ſaith <span class="hi">St. Mark</span>) becauſe the Phariſees ſaid, he had an unclean ſpirit, and that he caſt our Devils by <span class="hi">Belze­bub, &amp;c.</span> This ſpeech of the Phariſees, whereby they ſlande­red his Miracles, wrought by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, is properly the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt. How tranſcen­dent a crime it was, to traduce that power by which our Saviour wrought his Miracles, may ap­pear, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e405"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=6">[Page 7]</a></span> from the end for which theſe Miracles were wrought; which was, to prove to the peo­ple that ſaw them, that he was the <span class="hi">Meſſias;</span> which is evident from the places of Scripture, wherein he appealed to his works, 10 <span class="hi">Joh.</span> 37. 38. 14. <span class="hi">Joh.</span> 11. 11 <span class="hi">Math.</span> 4. 4. <span class="hi">Joh.</span> 29. Theſe and other places ſhew, that the working of Miracles, was an act of the moſt glorious manifeſtation of the power of God, by which at the firſt view, the ſimpleſt peo­ple were led by their outward ſenſe, to the great myſtery of inward Faith in Chriſt their Re­deemer.</p><p>Therefore, for thoſe men that were eye-witneſſes of thoſe Mi­racles which did make them know that Chriſt was a Teacher come <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e433"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=7">[Page 8]</a></span> from God, to Blaſpheme that power, by which theſe Miracles were wrought, and to ſay they were done by the help of the De­vil, was the moſt ſpightful and malicious ſlander that could be invented; for thereby they at­tempted, as much as in them lay, to deſtroy the very principles of Faith, and to prevent the very firſt propagation of the Goſpel, to the univerſal miſchief of all Mankind. And though theſe Phariſees were no Chriſtians, and therefore could not fall away from faith, which they never had, yet they did know and believe that Chriſt was a Teacher come from God; for ſo our Saviour tells them, 7 <span class="hi">Joh.</span> 28. Ye both know me, and whence I am. They did not believe him as a Saviour, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e443"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=7">[Page 9]</a></span> but as a great Prophet from God; (as the <span class="hi">Mahometans</span> do at this very day) they truſted to be ſaved by their Law, and becauſe he taught ſuch things as did abrogate their Law, in which they ſo much gloried, they were ſo malicious to his Doctrine, which they did not believe, that they ſpoke evil of his Miracles which they did believe; leaſt the people by ap­proving his Miracles, ſhould be­lieve his Doctrine.</p><p>4. Obſerve, that its ſaid to be Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe, by the Holy Ghoſt, the Miracles were wrought <span class="hi">Math.</span> 12 28. 1 <span class="hi">Cor</span> 12. 10.</p><p>5. The Blaſphemy againſt the Son of Man was, when men conſidered Chriſt as a mere man, and did diſgracefully tax his con­verſation, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e465"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=8">[Page 10]</a></span> by ſaying, behold a glutton, a bibber of Wine, a friend to Publicans and ſinners. But the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, was, when Men be­holding Chriſts Miracles, did enviouſly aſcribe them to the De­vil, which they knew and believed to be done by Gods power.</p><p>6. The Texts formerly cited out of the three Evangeliſts, being all the places wherein the Blaſ­phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt is named; we cannot find by them, that we have any ſafe rule to conclude, that any but the Scribes and Phariſees, and their confederates, committed that ſin. I dare not ſay, that <span class="hi">Judas, Julian</span> the Apoſtate, or <span class="hi">Simon Magus,</span> or thoſe that ſtoned <span class="hi">Stephen,</span> were guilty thereof.</p><p><span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e486"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=8">[Page 11]</a></span>7. The Apoſtles have not in any of their Epiſtles once men­tioned this Blaſphemy, and yet they were moſt careful and fre­quent in exhortations from all ſorts of ſin: It were much there­fore if they ſhould omit or forget ſuch a fearful crime, without of­ten and preciſe admoniſhing to beware of it. And though ne­gative proofs from Scripture, are not demonſtrative, yet the ge­neral ſilence of the Apoſtles, may at leaſt help to infer a pro­bability, that the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is not committable by any Chriſtian, which lived not in the time of our Saviour. As for thoſe Texts in the ſixth and tenth Chapter to the <span class="hi">Hebrews,</span> and in 1 <span class="hi">John</span> 5. 16. (which by late Divines are▪ <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e513"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=9">[Page 12]</a></span> expounded of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) I do not find that the Ancient Fathers did ſo un­derſtand them, excepting only <span class="hi">St. Auſtine,</span> who ſo interprets that one place in <span class="hi">St. John,</span> that all men confeſs him to be in an error. There be three Texts in the Epiſtles, wherein although the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt be not named, yet, moſt think, it is intended and meant. And <span class="hi">Bellarmine</span> confuting <span class="hi">St. Auſtin</span>'s opinion, who held, that final impenitency was the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt) affirms, that it ſeems the three Texts in the Epiſtles, are ſpoken of that ſin; and yet this great Cardinal forgetting what he had ſaid in the ſame Chapter contradicts him­ſelf, and ſhews how that thoſe <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e532"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=9">[Page 13]</a></span> three places are not to be inter­preted of that ſin. I will cite the Texts, and then his inter­pretation of them, according to the expoſition of <span class="hi">St. Ambroſe, Chryſoſtom, Hierom,</span> and other Fathers, as he ſaith.</p><p>The firſt is <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 6. It is im­poſſible, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> The Apoſtle here ſpeaks only of Repentance, which did go before Baptiſme, for ſo <span class="hi">Chryſoſtome</span> and <span class="hi">Ambroſe, &amp;c.</span> expound it; which the Apoſtle intimates in theſe words. Which were once enlightened, that is, Baptized, for anciently, to be illuminated, ſignified to be Baptized. Secondly, in theſe words (to renew again) for we are properly renewed in Bap­tiſme. Thirdly, in theſe (cruci­fying the Son of God afreſh) for <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e562"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=10">[Page 14]</a></span> when we are Baptized, we are conformed to the likeneſs of his death, 6 <span class="hi">Rom.</span> And as Chriſt was only once crucified, ſo alſo we are only once Baptized; and he that will be again Baptized, ſhould again crucifie to himſelf Ghriſt. Let me add this, that in the verſes next before this Text, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the founda­tion of Repentance, and the Doctrine of Baptiſme. And in this Text, our new Tranſlation followeth <span class="hi">Beza</span> (who hath vari­ed from the Original, by putting the conditional <span class="hi">Si, If,</span> inſtead of the Copulative <span class="hi">Et, And,</span> and by adding the Cauſal <span class="hi">Ut.</span>) ſo that whereas <span class="hi">Beza</span> and our Tranſlati­on is, <span class="hi">si prolabantur ut crucifigant,</span> The Greek, and vulgar Latine is, <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, <span class="hi">prolapſi</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e600"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=10">[Page 15]</a></span> <span class="hi">ſunt crucifigentes;</span> for the word doth not ſignify to fall away, but to fall caſually or negligent­ly, ſo <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> <span class="hi">Galat</span> 6. is tranſ­lated fault, but not falling away.</p><p>The ſecond Text is, <span class="hi">Hebrews</span> 10. 26.

Anſwer, I ſay with <span class="hi">Chry­ſoſtom, Ambroſe,</span> and other Fa­thers; The ſence is, we muſt not expect another Chriſt to dye for us, or that he that dyed once, ſhould come again to dye for us.</p><p>The third Text, 1 <span class="hi">Joh</span> 5. 16. There is a ſin unto death: I do not ſay ye ſhall pray for it; <span class="hi">St. Hierom</span> ſaith, that nothing elſe is here meant, but that a Prayer for a ſin unto death, is very hard­ly <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e641"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=11">[Page 16]</a></span> or difficultly heard; and this ſeems to be the trueſt ſenſe of this place: for <span class="hi">St. John</span> ſaith, in the verſe immediately before, we know we have the Petitions we deſire of him; therefore leaſt we ſhould think this to hold true in all Petitions even for others▪ he adds▪ if any Man ſee his Bro­ther ſin a ſin, which is not unto death, he ſhall ask, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> he ſhall ask, that is, let him ask with con­fidence, for he ſhall obtain; but if it be a ſin unto death, that is, a great ſin, ſuch an one as is not ordinarily pardoned, but puni­ſhed with death: I do not ſay, ye ſhall pray for it, that is I dare not promiſe that you ſhall eaſily obtain, and therefore I do not ſay that you ſhall pray for it, that is, with that confidence of obtain­ing; <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e665"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=11">[Page 17]</a></span> for often in ſuch caſes, God doth nothear the Prayers of his Saints; as God ſaith, <span class="hi">Jer.</span> 7. 16. If theſe expoſitions upon the former Texts be ſound, the Definition of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, cannot be grounded upon all or any of them: for as it is not name­ed, ſo it is not meant in any of them; but if they ſeem to any to be unſound, let him bring better and more agreeable to the literal meaning and ſence, cohe­rence and ſcope of the Text, and I ſhall gladly learn. It ſeems a probable expoſition of the firſt place, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 6. that a learned Di­vine, who produceth this Text for proof of his definition of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, doth confeſs againſt himſelf, that the Apoſtle in this place denieth a ſe­cond <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e682"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=12">[Page 18]</a></span> Baptiſme, where he ſpeak­eth of Repentance, becauſe they are mentioned together in the ſame place, and have ſome affi­nity and correſpondence. As for the ſecond Text, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 10. I muſt ſay, that if <span class="hi">St. Paul</span> in this place, meant the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that then this were the only deſperate Text in the whole Bible, for what Man is there that ſins not willingly; for ſo the word <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span> properly ſig­nifies: <span class="hi">Beza</span> tranſlates it <span class="hi">ultro,</span> the vulgar Latine, <span class="hi">voluntariè,</span> or willingly, not wilfully, or ob­ſtinately. It is but a miſerable ſhift, when <span class="hi">St. Paul</span> ſaith, if we ſin willingly, for Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> to tell us, that the Text doth not mean every willing ſin, but only a ma­litious reſiſting of the Truth. <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e721"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=12">[Page 19]</a></span> Could not <span class="hi">St. Paul,</span> as eaſily as Mr <span class="hi">Calvin,</span> have ſaid, If we ſin malitiouſly, as ſay, if we ſin willingly? My comfort is, that if the Text be adviſedly conſi­dered, there is no ſuch thing as the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or any other deſperate concluſi­on, to be found in the Text; the ſcope of the precedent verſes do evidently expound the Apoſtles meaning to be this, to let the <span class="hi">Jews</span> know, that the caſe was not now with them, as it was under the Law; for under the Law they had daily ſacrifice for ſin, but now under the Goſpel they had but one ſacrifice, once for all; every Prieſt ſtandeth dai­ly miniſtring and offering often times the ſame ſacrifice, but this Man after he had offered one <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e739"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=13">[Page 20]</a></span> ſacrifice, for ever ſate down at the right hand of God, as it is, verſe 11. of that Chapter, which may ſerve for a comment upon the Verſe now in queſtion. And it is worth our noting, that the Text doth not ſay, if we ſin wil­fully, there is no ſacrifice for ſin; this had been an hard ſaying in­deed; but the words are, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin: there is ſome comfortable diffe­rence, I hope, between theſe two propoſitions; there is no ſacrifice, and there remains no more ſacra­fice for ſin: So that if we do not believe in that one ſacrifice, as ſufficient, but look every day for ſome new ſacrifice for every new ſin, we muſt expect no­thing but judgment.</p><p>As to the third place, 1 <span class="hi">Ioh.</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e757"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=13">[Page 21]</a></span> 5. 16. many would conclude, there is a ſin for which we may not pray; Firſt, becauſe it is ir­remiſſable, and this they think muſt needs be the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, meant by <span class="hi">St. Iohn,</span> Their beſt argument is, <span class="hi">Iohn</span>'s not ſaying we ſhould pray, is a ſaying we ſhould not pray; his ſilence to them is prohibition. This is bad Grammar, and worſe Logick. For we find, that <span class="hi">St. Stephen</span> prayed for them that ſto­ned him, and yet told them they reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt. And <span class="hi">St. Peter</span> exhorted <span class="hi">Simon Magus</span> to Repentance, and yet both he and thoſe that ſtoned <span class="hi">Stephen,</span> are commonly reputed ſinners againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <span class="hi">St. Am­broſe</span> is of that charitable opinion, that he thinks the ſin againſt the <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e788"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=14">[Page 22]</a></span> Holy Ghoſt may be pardoned by Repentance, becauſe the people of the <span class="hi">Iews,</span> that had ſaid of Chriſt, that he caſt out Devils by <span class="hi">Belzebub,</span> afterwards at the preach­ing of <span class="hi">St. Peter,</span> are ſaid to be converted, <span class="hi">Acts</span> 2. <span class="hi">St. Auſtine</span> in a Retract concludes, we muſt deſpair of no Man, no not of the wickedeſt, as long as he liveth; and we ſafely pray for him, of whom we don't deſpair. For though it be expreſly ſaid, That the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven, yet theſe words may juſtly receive a qualification, if we will but al­low the ſame mitigation of theſe words, which all Men confeſs we muſt needs allow to the precedent words in the ſame verſe, to which theſe have relation; where <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e810"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=14">[Page 23]</a></span> it is ſaid generally, all Sins, and all Blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven, it cannot be meant of all ſins al­ways, and to all Men, for then no ſin could be damnable, but the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is moſt falſe; and there­fore the meaning muſt be, all ſins ſhall be forgiven ordinarily, and for the moſt part; ſo on the contrary, Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not ordinarily, but hardly be forgiven. Even thoſe who are moſt ſtrict to main­tain the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to be unpardonable, will yet acknowledge, that ſome times in Scripture, Impoſſibility is uſed to note a difficulty, and thoſe things are ſpoken indefinitely to all, which belong but to a part only. Thus the difficulty of a <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e819"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=15">[Page 24]</a></span> rich Mans entering into the King­dome of Heaven, is preſented to us by our Saviour, under the ſimilitude of an impoſſibility.</p><p>Having diſpatch'd theſe Texts of Scripture which do either name, or are thought to con­cern, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it remains to examine thoſe common Definitions of this ſin which are now current; though different in the terms by which they define it; ſome call it a total or final falling away from faith, or a wilful Apoſtacy, or a malicious reſiſting of the truth; yet when they come to explain their meaning, the dif­ference among them is not conſi­derable. I ſhall chiefly apply my ſelf to Mr <span class="hi">Calvin's</span> definition, becauſe his judgment hath gain­ed <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e837"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=15">[Page 25]</a></span> the greateſt reputation among the multitude; as alſo, for that he himſelf promiſes ſuch a true defi­nition, as ſhall eaſily, by it ſelf overthrow all the reſt. In his <span class="hi">Inſtitut. Lib.</span> 3. <span class="hi">Chap.</span> 3. he ſaith, they ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <span class="hi">Qui divinae veritati (cujus fulgore ſic perſtringuntur ut ignorantiam cauſari nequeunt) tamen deſtinata malitia reſiſtunt, in hoc tantum, ut reſiſtant. Arminius</span> alſo uſeth Mr <span class="hi">Calvins</span> words. The Rhe­torical Parentheſis, which might well have been ſpared in a defi­nition, being reduced to plain and brief terms; this definition of <span class="hi">Calvin</span> may be thus Engliſhed, They ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, who of determined malice, reſiſt the known Truth of God, to the end only to reſiſt. In this <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e861"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=16">[Page 26]</a></span> Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> doth not define what the ſin is, but who they are that commit it; whereas by the Rules of Logick, <span class="hi">Concretes</span> admit of no definition, but only <span class="hi">Abſtracts.</span> But taking the definition as it is, it conſiſts principally upon theſe three terms. Firſt, Truth; Secondly, Known; Thirdly, Re­ſiſted; or a reſiſting of the known Truth. The words being gene­ral and doubtful, we will conſi­der them ſingly.</p><p>Firſt, If by the truth Mr <span class="hi">Cal­vin</span> underſtands the Word of God, or the whole Doctrine re­vealed in the Scriptures, then the ſenſe of this Term will be too large: for even the Phariſees which ſpoke againſt the Holy Ghoſt, did not reſiſt the whole Truth of God in the Scripture, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e888"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=16">[Page 27]</a></span> for they believed in the Law of <span class="hi">Moſes,</span> and had confidence to be ſaved by the keeping of it. And in defence of that Law, (as they thought) they did Blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt. Therefore pro­perly by the Truth of God, Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> muſt confine his meaning to the Truth of the Goſpel or Doctrine of Faith, for ſo both he himſelf and others expound themſelves, by terming the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, a falling away, or turning away from Faith, or Apoſtacy.</p><p>Secondly, By this word Known, Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> muſt mean belief, for Faith is properly by believing, not knowing the truth.</p><p>Thirdly, The Word, Reſiſt­ing, muſt mean unbelieving: for if receiving of the Truth be by <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e908"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=17">[Page 28]</a></span> belief, then Reſiſting of the Truth muſt be<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span> unbelief. And indeed Mr. <span class="hi">Calvin</span> explains him­ſelf in the ſame Chapter, ſay­ing, there is no place for pardon where knowledge is joyned with unbelief, <span class="hi">Non eſſe veniae locum, &amp;c.</span> So then by this definition, to reſiſt the known Truth, is all one, as if Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> had ſaid in proper terms, for a Man at once to unbelieve that which he doth believe; which two things it is impoſſible to do together? and if they be not together, there can be no reſiſtance. It is true, that for ſome reaſons, a Man may be brought, not to believe that which he formerly believed. This cannotbe in an inſtant, but ſucceſſively unbelief comes in the place of belief. And this <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e928"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=17">[Page 29]</a></span> may not be called a reſiſting, for that all reſiſtance conſiſts in a violence between two at the leaſt; but where two ſucceed one another, and are never to­gether, it cannot poſſibly be. I confeſſ a Man may reſiſt the Truth, when it is a Truth, in it ſelf only, or in the underſtanding of ſome other; but to reſiſt the Truth which is known, and believed by the re­ſiſter himſelf, is a direct contra­diction; for the nature of Truth is ſuch, that if the underſtand­ing apprehend it for Truth, it cannot but aſſent unto it. No Man can force himſelf to believe what he liſts, or when he liſts. Sometimes a Man knows not what to believe, but finds a ſuſ­penſion of his Faith, or trepida­tion <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e943"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=18">[Page 30]</a></span> of his underſtanding, not knowing which way to turn. This cannot be called a reſiſting of the Truth, when the Truth is not known, but doubted of. Again, ſome Truths there be, though they be aſſented to by the underſtanding for Truths, yet they are not deſired as good; for truth is one degree nearer the Soul of Man than goodneſs. The Phariſees did apprehend the Mi­racles of our Saviour as true, but not as good; becauſe they ten­ded to the derogation of their Law, which they eſteemed a bet­ter Truth. And for this cauſe, they Blaſphemed that Truth, which in their hearts they belie­ved for Truth. For the truth of words, or ſpeech, is, (as the Schools ſay) nothing elſe but the <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e954"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=18">[Page 31]</a></span> ſign of truth, not truth it ſelf; for truth it ſelf is ſeated in the underſtanding, and not in the ſpeech. That Truth which the underſtanding aſſents to, the ſpeech may affirm to be falſe; there are many things believed in deed, which are denied in word: but ſuch a denial is not reſiſting, but only making ſhew of reſiſting, the Truth; for re­ſiſtance muſt be in the ſame place where Truth is; Truth being ſeated in the underſtanding, re­ſiſtance muſt be placed there al­ſo; the underſtanding can reſiſt no Truth, but by unbelieving of it. If Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> had intended of the Truth only in word, he had come one ſtep nearer to the Truth of Scripture, but he was not ſo happy in the expreſſion of <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e966"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=19">[Page 32]</a></span> his meaning: nay his terms of Incredulity, Apoſtacy, falling away, <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> relate to a real, not verbal, Apoſtacy, and Un­belief. It remains then to my un­derſtanding, that Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> makes the reſiſtance of the Truth to be a not believing of what we do believe; which being a con­tradiction, he defines the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to be ſuch a Sin, as no Man poſſibly can commit. And yet in the other extream, in expounding his own definition, he makes it ſuch a Sin, as no Man living but commits; for by his Doctrine, (as I take it) any Sin may be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. His words are theſe, <span class="hi">Quorum convi­cta eſt conſcientia verbum Dei eſſe quod repudiant &amp; impugnant, im­pugnare</span> <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e988"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=19">[Page 33]</a></span> <span class="hi">tamen non deſiſtant, ill<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> in ſpiritum blaſphemari dicuntur.</span> What Man is there that doth not daily, in ſome Point or other, for ſake the word of God, and cea­ſes not to impugne it, and is convinced thereof in his Con­ſcience: I know Mr <span class="hi">Calvin</span> was far from thinking, that <span class="hi">St. Paul,</span> did Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and yet <span class="hi">St. Paul</span> it ſeems was convinced in his Conſcience, that it was the Word of God he fought againſt, and yet ceaſed not to fight againſt it, when he ſaith, he delighted in the Law of God, yet another Law war­ring againſt the Law of his mind, brought him into Captivity of the Law of Sin. What dange­rous conſequences weak Con­ſciences may draw to themſelves, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1018"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=20">[Page 34]</a></span> out of this unbridled, unlimited propoſition of Mr <span class="hi">Calvins,</span> let others judge. There is a juſt cauſe I. preſume to except againſt Mr <span class="hi">Galvin,</span> and all others, who in this concurr with him, to omit the term of Blaſphemy in their de­finitions; for this is perpetually obſerved by our Saviour in his ſpeech concerning this Sin, by the Evangeliſts with one conſent: but inſtead of the word Blaſphe­my, he hath brought in the word, reſiſt, for a Genus of this Sin; but by what Authority I know not; I cannot find it, or the equivalent to it, in any of theſe places, which are thought to touch this Sin I find only falling away mentioned, <span class="hi">Heb.</span> 6. which phraſe is uſed by Mr <span class="hi">Cal­vin,</span> for reſiſting; whereas fal­ling <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1041"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=20">[Page 35]</a></span> away, and reſiſting, are no more alike, than fighting and run­ing away, which are little leſs than contraries. The laſt point I ſhall touch in Mr <span class="hi">Calvins</span> de­finition, is, where he ſaith, the Sinners againſt the Holy Ghoſt reſiſt, to the end only that they may reſiſt; and yet withall he tells, they reſiſt out of a deter­minate malice. If they reſiſt out of malice, then the end for which they reſiſt, is for the ſatiſ­faction of their malice. The Phariſees here condemned by our Saviour, had an other end than bare reſiſting. The defence of the Law of <span class="hi">Moſes,</span> was the end for which they Blaſphemed, and not any pleaſure they could have in the bare and ſimple act of reſiſtance. We find three old <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1058"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=21">[Page 36]</a></span> opinions, concerning the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but they were long ſince exploded; I will but only name them. <span class="hi">Ori­gen</span> thought, all Sins committed after Baptiſme, were Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt: his reaſon was only a witleſs conceit of his own, That God the Father was in all things, the Son only in all rea­ſonable Creatures, the Holy Ghoſt in all regenerate Men. Therefore when Men Sin againſt the Divine Perſon, which is in them, if they be Heathen, they Sin againſt God the Father, or Son; if they be Chriſtians, they Sin againſt God the Holy Goſt; but this opinion is falſe. The <span class="hi">Novatian</span> Hereticks agreed with <span class="hi">Origen</span> in opinion, for they denied remiſ­ſion of Sins to any that fell, think­ing <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1078"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=21">[Page 37]</a></span> all falls of Chriſtians to be Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but this opinion is falſe; elſe all Sins were unpardonable to Chriſtians. Yet we find <span class="hi">St. Paul,</span> to remit the Sins of the inceſtuous <span class="hi">Corinthian.</span></p><p>Our Saviour alſo chargeth the Phariſees with this, who were no Chriſtians. <span class="hi">St. Auſtin</span> thought final impenitency to be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but final impe­nitency is no Blaſphemy, but only a general circumſtance, that may accompany any Sin: beſides, our Saviour intends, that this Sin may be found in this life. And the Phariſees were alive when they were accuſed of it <span class="hi">Pet. Lumbard,</span> and <span class="hi">Tho. Aquinas,</span> thought Sins of Malice, to be Sins againſt the Ho­ly Ghoſt, and Sins of infirmity againſt the Father, and Sins of ig­norance <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1106"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=22">[Page 38]</a></span> againſt the Son. This opi­nion is falſe, becauſe the Sin a­gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, muſt be a Sin of ſome certain Blaſphemy, but malice is no certain Sin, but a General, and 'tis not always a Blaſphemy.</p><p>The ſix differences the School­men make of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are theſe;</p><p>1.

Now that you may ſee how indif­ferently I walk, I will open the miſtakes of both parties, that ſo the truth of the thing it ſelf (being unclouded of Errors) may the more clearly ſhine forth.</p><p>The firſt miſtake common to both is, That they ground them­ſelves much upon the words of Conſecration, as they are called, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1236"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=25">[Page 42]</a></span> and ſuppoſe, That upon the pro­nouncing of thoſe words, ſome­thing befalls that action, which otherwiſe would not; and that without thoſe words the action were lame. <span class="hi">Sir,</span> I muſt confeſs my ignorance unto you. I find no ground for the neceſſity of this do­ing. Our Saviour inſtituting that Holy Ceremony, commands us to do what he did, leaves us no Pre­cept of ſaying any words; nei­ther will it be made appear, that either the bleſſed Apoſtles, or Pri­mitive Chriſtians had any ſuch Cuſtom: Nay the contrary will be made probably to appear out of ſome of the antienteſt Writings of the Churches Ceremonials. Our Saviour indeed uſed the Words, but it was to expreſs what his meaning was; had he barely act­ed <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1256"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=25">[Page 43]</a></span> the thing, without expreſſing himſelf by ſome ſuch Form of Words, we could never have known what it was he did. But what neceſſity is there now of ſo doing? for when the Congrega­tion is met together, to the break­ing of Bread and Prayer, and ſee Bread and Wine upon the Com­munion Table, is there any man can doubt of the meaning of it, although the Canon be not read? It was the farther ſolemnizing, and beautifying that holy action which brought the Canon in; and not an opinion of adding any thing to the ſubſtance of the action. For that the words were uſed by our Saviour to work any thing upon the Bread and Wine, can never out of Scripture or Reaſon be deduced; and beyond theſe two, I have no <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1265"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=26">[Page 44]</a></span> ground for my Religion, neither in Subſtance nor in Ceremony. The main Foundation that up­holds the neceſſity of this form of action now in uſe, is Church-Cuſtom and Church-Error.</p><p>Now for that Topique place of Church-Cuſtom, it is generally too much abuſed: For whereas na­turally the neceſſity of the thing ought to give warrant to the pra­ctice of the Church; I know not by what device matters are turned about, and the cuſtomary practice of the Church is alledged to prove the neceſſity of the thing; as if things had received their Original from the Church-Authority, and not as the truth is, from an high­er Hand. As for the Churches Er­ror, on which I told you this Form of action is founded, it conſiſts in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1279"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=26">[Page 45]</a></span> the uncautelous taking up an un­ſound ungrounded concluſion of the Fathers for a religious Maxim. St. <span class="hi">Ambroſe,</span> I trow, was he that ſaid it, and poſterity hath too ge­nerally applauded it, <span class="hi">Accedat ver­bum ad elementum, &amp; fiat Sacramen­tum.</span> By which they would per­ſwade us, againſt all experience, that to make up a Sacrament, there muſt be ſomething ſaid and ſome­thing done; whereas indeed to the perfection of a Sacrament, or ho­ly Myſtery (for both theſe are one) it is ſufficient that one thing be done whereby another is ſigni­fied, though nothing be ſaid at all. When <span class="hi">Tarquinius</span> was walking in his Garden, a Meſſenger came and asked him, what he would have done unto the Town of <span class="hi">Gabij,</span> then newly taken? He anſwered no­thing▪ <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1317"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=27">[Page 46]</a></span> But with his Wand ſtruck off the tops of the higheſt <span class="hi">Popies;</span> and the Meſſenger underſtanding his meaning, cut off the Heads of the chief of the City. Had this been done in <span class="hi">Sacris,</span> it had been forth­with truly a Sacrament, or holy Myſtery. <span class="hi">Cum in omnibus Scientiis vo­ces ſignificent res, hoc habet proprium Theologia, quòd ipſaeres ſignificatae per voces, etiam ſignificent aliquid,</span> ſaith <span class="hi">Aquinas;</span> and upon the ſecond ſig­nification are all Spiritual and my­ſtical ſenſes founded: So that <span class="hi">in Sacris,</span> a Myſtery or Sacrament is then acted, when one thing is done and another is ſignified, as it is in the Holy Communion, though nothing be ſaid at all. The ancient Sacrifices of the <span class="hi">Jews,</span> whether weekly, monethly, or yearly, their Paſſover, their ſitting in Boothes, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1346"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=27">[Page 47]</a></span> <span class="hi">&amp;c.</span> Theſe were all Sacraments, yet we find not any ſacred forms of words, uſed by the Prieſts or People in the execution of them.</p><p>To ſum up that which we have to ſay in this Point, the calling upon the words of conſecration in the Euchariſt, is too weakly found­ed to be made argumentative, for the action is perfect, whether thoſe words be uſed or forborn: And in truth to ſpeak my opinion, I ſee no great harm could enſue, were they quite omitted. Certain­ly thus much good would follow, that ſome part (though not a lit­tle one) of the ſuperſtition that ad­heres to that action, by reaſon of an ungrounded conceit of the ne­ceſſity and force of the words in it, would forthwith pill off and fall away: I would not have you un­derſtand <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1366"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=28">[Page 48]</a></span> me ſo, as if I would pre­ſcribe for, or deſire the diſuſe of the words; only two things I would commend to you, Firſt, That the uſe of the Canon is a thing indifferent. And, Secondly, That in this knack of making Sa­craments, Chriſtians have taken a greater liberty than they can well juſtify: Firſt, In forging Sacra­ments, more than God (for ought doth or can appear) did ever in­tend: And Secondly, In adding to the Sacraments inſtituted of God many formalities, and cere­monial circumſtances upon no warrant but their own; which cir­cumſtances by long uſe, begat in the minds of men a conceit, that they were eſſential parts of that to which indeed they were but appen­dant; and that only by the device of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1383"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=28">[Page 49]</a></span> ſome who practiſed a power in the Church morethan was convenient.</p><p>Thus much for the firſt com­mon miſtake.</p><p>The Second is worſe than it; You ſee that both parts agreed in the acknowledgment of the real preſence of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, though they differ in the manner of his Preſence, and application of himſelf to the recei­ver; though the Proteſtant Diſpu­tant ſeems to have gone a little be­yond his Leader: Had he expreſt himſelf in the point of Bread and Wine, what became of it, whe­ther it remain'd in its proper nature yea or no, I could the better have fathom'd him: Now theſe words of his, that the Bread and Wine after conſecration are truly▪ and really the Body of Chriſt, howſo­ever <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1405"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=29">[Page 50]</a></span> they are ſuppled and allayed with that clauſe, <span class="hi">not after a carnal, but after a ſpiritual manner,</span> yet ſtill remain too crude and raw, and betray the Speaker for a <span class="hi">Lutheran</span> at leaſt, if not for a favourer of the Church of <span class="hi">Rome;</span> for as for that Phraſe, <span class="hi">of a ſpiritual manner,</span> which ſeems to give ſeaſon and moderation to his concluſion, it can yield him but ſmall relief: For firſt, To ſay the fleſh of Chriſt is in the Bread, but <span class="hi">not after a car­nal manner,</span> is but the ſame non­ſence, which the Divines of <span class="hi">Rome</span> put upon us on the like occaſion, when telling us, that the Blood of Chriſt is really ſacrificed, and ſhed in the Sacrament, they add by way of Gloſs, that it is done <span class="hi">incruente,</span> unbloodily▪ by the like Analogy they may tell us, if they pleaſe, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1436"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=29">[Page 51]</a></span> that the body of Chriſt is there in­corporated unbodily, Fleſh not carnally may paſs the Preſs jointly the next Edition of the Book of Bulls. Again, in another reſpect, That clauſe, <span class="hi">of a ſpiritual manner</span> doth your Proteſtant Diſputer but little ſervice, if any at all; for the Catholick Diſputant contriving with himſelf how to ſeat the Body of God in the Euchariſt, as may be moſt for his eaſe, tells us, that he is there as Spirits and glorified Bodies (which St. <span class="hi">Paul</span> calls <span class="hi">ſpiri­tual</span>) are in the places they poſſeſs; ſo then, the one tells you the Body of Chriſt is there really, but ſpiri­tually; the other, that he is there really, but as a Spirit in a place; and what now, I pray you, is the difference between them? By the way, in the paſſage you may ſee <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1454"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=30">[Page 52]</a></span> what account to make of your Ca­tholick Diſputer. <span class="hi">Ariſtotle,</span> and with him common ſenſe, tells us thus much, <span class="hi">That he that compares two Bodies together, muſt know them both;</span> Doth this Gentleman know any thing concerning the ſite and locality of Spirits, and Bodies glorified? if he doth, let him do us the courteſy as to ſhew us, at what price he purchaſed that de­gree of knowledg, that ſo we may try our Credit, and ſee if we can buy it at the ſame rate; <span class="hi">Tertius è Coelo cecidit Cato?</span> Is he like a ſe­cond <span class="hi">Paul,</span> lately deſcended out of the third Heavens, and there hath made us the diſcovery? for by what other means he could at­tain to that knowledg, my dul­neſs cannot ſuggeſt.

An evident ſign of this Truth you may ſee in this by the Providence of God: the Writings of many learned Chriſtians from the Spring of Chriſtianity, have been left unto poſterity, and amongſt all thoſe, ſcarcely any is to be found who is not confeſt on all hands to have miſtaken ſome things, and thoſe miſtakes for the moſt part ſtand upon Record by ſome who <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1733"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=36">[Page 65]</a></span> purpoſely obſerved them. Nei­ther let this (I beſeech you) be­get in you a conceit as if I meant to diſgrace thoſe whoſe Labours have been and are of infinite bene­fit in the Church. For if <span class="hi">Ariſtotle,</span> and <span class="hi">Aphrodiſeus,</span> and <span class="hi">Galen,</span> and the reſt of thoſe Excellent men whom God had indued with extraordina­ry portions of natural Knowledge, have with all thankful and ingeni­ous men throughout all Generati­ons retained their Credit entire, notwithſtanding it is acknowledg­ed that they have all of them in many things, ſwerved from the Truth; Then, why ſhould not Chriſtians expreſs the ſame inge­nuity to thoſe who have laboured before us in the Expoſition of the Chriſtian Faith, and highly eſteem them for their Works ſake, their <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1762"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=37">[Page 66]</a></span> many infirmities notwithſtanding? You will ſay, that for private per­ſons it is confeſt they may and dai­ly do err; But can Chriſtians err by whole Shoals, by Armies meet­ing for defence of the Truth in Sy­nods▪ and Councils, eſpecially Ge­neral, which are countenanced by the great Fable of all the World, the Biſhop of <span class="hi">Rome?</span></p><p>I anſwer, To ſay that Councils may not err, though private per­ſons may, at firſt ſight is a merry ſpeech; as if a man ſhould ſay, That every ſingle Souldier indeed may run away, but a whole Army cannot, eſpecially having <span class="hi">Hannibal</span> for their Captain; and ſince it is confeſt, that all ſingle perſons not only may, but do err, it will prove a very hard matter, to gather out of theſe a multitude, of whom be­ing <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1790"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=37">[Page 67]</a></span> gathered together, we may be ſecured they cannot err. I muſt for mine own part confeſs, that Councils, and Synods not only may and have erred, but conſide­ring the means how they are ma­naged, it were a great marvel if they did not err: For what men are they of whom thoſe great Meetings do conſiſt? are they the beſt, the moſt learned, the moſt vertuous, the moſt likely to walk uprightly? No, the greateſt, the moſt ambitious, and many times men, neither of Judgment, nor Learning; ſuch are they of whom theſe Bodies do conſiſt: and are theſe men in common equity like­ly to determine for Truth? <span class="hi">Qui ut in vita, ſic in cauſis, ſpes quoque im­probas alunt,</span> as <span class="hi">Quintilian</span> ſpeaks. Again, when ſuch perſons are <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1807"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=38">[Page 68]</a></span> thus met, their way to proceed to concluſion, is not by weight of Reaſon, but by multitude of Votes and Suffrages; as if it were a max­im in nature, that the greater part muſt needs be the better; where­as our common experience ſhews, That, <span class="hi">Nunquam ita bene agitur cum rebus humanis ut plures ſint meliores.</span> It was never heard in any profeſſi­on, that Concluſion of Truth went by plurality of Voices, the Chriſtian profeſſion only excepted; and I have often muſed how it comes to paſs, that the way which in all other Sciences is not able to warrant the pooreſt Concluſion, ſhould be thought ſufficient to give authority to Concluſions in Divi­nity, the Supream Empreſs of Sciences. But I ſee what it is that is uſually pleaded, and with your <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1821"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=38">[Page 69]</a></span> leave I will a little conſider of it.</p><p>It is given out, that Chriſtian meetings have ſuch an aſſiſtance of God, and his bleſſed Spirit, that let their perſons be what they will they may aſſure themſelves againſt all poſſibility of miſtaking; and this is that they ſay, which to this way of ending Controverſies, which in all other Sciences is ſo contemptible, gives a determi­ning to Theological Diſputes of ſo great Authority. And this mu­ſick of the Spirit is ſo pleaſing, that it hath taken the Reformed Party too; For with them likewiſe all things at length end in the Spirit; but with this difference, that thoſe of <span class="hi">Rome</span> confine the Spirit to the Biſhops and Counſels of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> but the Proteſtant en­largeth this working of the Spirit, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1838"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=39">[Page 70]</a></span> and makes it the Director of pri­vate meditations. I ſhould doubt­leſs do great injury to the good­neſs of God, if I ſhould deny the ſufficient aſſiſtance of God to the whoſe world, to preſerve them both from ſin in their Actions, and damnable errors in their opinions; much more ſhould I do it, if I denied it to the Church of God; but this aſſiſtance of God may very well be, and yet men may fall into ſin and errors. St. <span class="hi">Paul</span> preach­ing to the <span class="hi">Gentiles,</span> tells them that God was with them in ſo palpable a manner, that even by groping they might have found him, yet both he and we know what the <span class="hi">Gentiles</span> did. Chriſt hath promiſed his perpetual aſſiſtance to his Church; but hath he left any Pro­pheſie, that the Church ſhould <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1860"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=39">[Page 71]</a></span> perpetually adhere to him? if any man think he hath, it is his part to inform us, where this Propheſy is to be found. That matters may go well with men, two things muſt concur, the aſſiſtance of God to men, and the adherence of men to God; if either of theſe be deficient, there will be little good done. Now the firſt of theſe is never deficient, but the ſecond is very often; ſo that the Promiſe of Chriſts perpetual pre­ſence made unto the Church, in­fers not at all any preſumption of Infallibility. As for that term of Spirit which is ſo much taken up, to open the danger that lurks under it, we muſt a little diſtin­guiſh upon the Word. This term [<span class="hi">Spirit of God,</span>] either ſignifies the third Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1872"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=40">[Page 72]</a></span> or elſe the wonderful power of Miracles, of Tongues, of Heal­ing, <span class="hi">&amp;c,</span> which was given to the Apoſtles, and other of the Primi­tive Chriſtians, at the firſt preach­ing of the Goſpel, but both theſe meanings are ſtrangers to our pur­poſe; The Spirit of God, as it concerns the Queſtion here in hand, ſignifies either ſomething within us, or ſomething without us; Without us, it ſignifies the written Word, recorded in the Books of the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, which are meto­nymically called the Spirit, be­cauſe the Holy Ghoſt ſpake thoſe things by their mouths when they lived, and now ſpeaks unto us by their pens when they are dead. If you pleaſe to receive it, this alone is left as Chriſts Vicar in his ab­ſence, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1892"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=40">[Page 73]</a></span> to give us directions both in our actions and opinions; he that tells you of another Spirit in the Church to direct you in your way, may as well tell you a tale of a Puck, or a walking Spirit in the Church-Yard. But that this Spirit ſpeaking without us may be beneficial to us, <span class="hi">oportet aliquid intus eſse,</span> there muſt be ſomething within us, which alſo we call the Spirit; and this is twofold; For either it ſignifies a ſecret Illapſe, or ſupernatural Influence of God up­on the hearts of men, by which he is ſuppoſed inwardly, to incline, inform, and direct men in their ways, and wills, and to preſerve them from ſin and miſtake; or elſe it ſignifies that in us, which is oppoſed againſt the fleſh, &amp; which denominates us ſpiritual men, and <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1900"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=41">[Page 74]</a></span> by which we are ſaid <span class="hi">to walk accord­ing to the Spirit;</span> that which St. <span class="hi">Paul</span> means, when he tells us, <span class="hi">The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spi­rit againſt the Fleſh,</span> (Rom. 7.) <span class="hi">ſo that we may not do what we liſt.</span> Now of theſe two, the former it is, which the Church ſeems to appeal unto in de ermining Controverſies by way of Counſel: But to this I have little to ſay. <span class="hi">Firſt,</span> Becauſe I know not whether there be any ſuch thing yea, or no. <span class="hi">Secondly</span> Becauſe experience ſhews, that the pretence of the Spirit in this ſence is very dangerous, as being next at hand to give countenance to impoſture and abuſe: which is a thing ſuffi­ciently ſeen, and acknowledged both by the Papiſt and Proteſtant Party; as it appears by this, that though both pretend unto it, yet <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1927"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=41">[Page 75]</a></span> both upbraid each other with the pretence of it. But the Spirit in the ſecond ſence, is that I contend for; and this is nothing but the Reaſon illuminated by Revelation out of the written Word. For when the Mind and Spirit humbly conform and ſubmit to the written Will of God, then you are properly ſaid to have the Spirit of God, and to walk according to the Spirit, not accord­ing to the Fleſh. This alone is that Spirit which preſerves us frō ſtray­ing from the Truth; For he indeed that hath the Spirit, errs not at all, or if he do, it is with as little hazard and danger as may be; which is the higheſt point of Infallibility, which either private Perſons or Churches can arrive unto. Yet would I not have you to conceive that I deny that at this day the Holy Ghoſt <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1937"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=42">[Page 76]</a></span> communicates himſelf to any in this ſecret and ſupernatural manner, as in foregoing times He had been wont to do; indeed my own many uncleanneſſes are ſufficient reaſons to hinder that good Spirit to parti­cipate himſelf unto me, after that manner. The Holy Ghoſt was pleaſed to come down like a Dove; <span class="hi">Veniunt ad candida tecta Co­lumbae. Accipiet nullas ſordida Turris Aves.</span> Now it is no reaſon to con­clude the Holy Ghoſt imparts himſelf in this manner to none, becauſe he hath not done that favour unto me.

The cuſtom and manner of the <span class="hi">Jews,</span> (eſpecially ſince the times of the <span class="hi">Macchabees</span>) being to allow Acts of greater labour and pain than the plucking of an Ear, namely, waging War againſt their Enemies, the Travelling of Car­ryers and Merchants, with ſuch o­thers, even on the Sabbath-Day.

At the firſt appearance, it is plain, the <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3560"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=78">[Page 148]</a></span> form of words is not Proper, but Metaphorical.

The natural way to diſ­cover this, is to ſee what the Uſe of <span class="hi">Keys,</span> properly taken, is; and after that, what means they are, which in our endeavours to attain to the <span class="hi">Kingdom of Heaven,</span> have ſome­thing proportionable to the Uſe of <span class="hi">Keys:</span> and thi<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> being once diſcove­red, there can remain no Queſtion What are the <span class="hi">Keys.</span></p><p>Now nothing is more known, than that the only Uſe of <span class="hi">Keys</span> is to Open and Shut, to admit us Unto, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3597"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=78">[Page 149]</a></span> or exclude us from the poſſeſſion of what we ſeek. Now ſince the <span class="hi">Kingdom of Heaven</span> is compared to a Houſe, from which all the Sons of <span class="hi">Adam,</span> by Nature are excluded; whatſoever then it is that gives us way, that removes all Obſtacle<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> which hinder us from entrance of that Houſe, that certainly muſt be underſtood by the Name of <span class="hi">Keys.</span> Now all theſe means, or whatſo­ever elſe it is which doth further us towards the poſſeſſing our ſelves of Eternal Life, they were all laid down in the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, committed by him fully and firſt of all to the diſpen­ſation of the bleſſed Apoſtles, to be reported by them, or their means, all the World over. So that I think I may ſafely lay thus much for the firſt Ground of the Queſtion be­twixt <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3619"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=79">[Page 150]</a></span> your ſelf and me, <span class="hi">Claves Regni Coelorum ſunt Doctrina Evan­gelii.</span></p><p>Now ſince Keyes are nothing without ſome hand to manage them, we muſt in the ſecond place diſcover into whoſe hands they are committed. And for this purpoſe, firſt of all, It muſt not be denyed that principally and properly, (I might well enough add only, if I liſted, but that I ſpare you) the Hand of God it is, that manages and applies theſe <span class="hi">Keys;</span> For of God and Chriſt it is written, <span class="hi">He hath the Keys, he opens, and no man ſhuts; he ſhuts, and no man opens.</span> Yet ſince it hath plea­ſed God to uſe the Miniſtry of Men, to the ſaving of Men, and bringing them into the Kingdom of Heaven; In a ſecondary ſenſe <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3636"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=79">[Page 151]</a></span> the <span class="hi">Keys</span> of that Kingdom are ſaid to be put into the hands of Men. In as much as it hath pleaſed the Wiſdom of God, not to uſe theſe <span class="hi">Keys,</span> at leaſt as far as concerns the beneficial and opening part, ſome act of Man not firſt premi­ſed; for ſince that Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is the Sum of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and Faith cometh not but by hearing, and hearing cometh not but by preaching, and preaching is the act of Men alone, (for God employs not Angels in that behalf,) It appears that this Preaching, or manifeſtation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel not per­formed, the <span class="hi">Keys</span> muſt needs be unprofitable. By the manifeſtati­on of the Goſpel of God, I mean not only the labour of the lip, in expounding, praying, reproving, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3654"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=80">[Page 152]</a></span> or the like, but the adminiſtration of Sacraments, the acting (if any thing beyond this is to be acted) whatſoever the manifeſtation of the Goſpel requireth. So that I think I may ſet down for a ſecond Ground towards the ſetling of the Point in queſtion, thus much, That the managing or application of the <span class="hi">Keys,</span> ſo far forth as men are in­truſted with them, is, <span class="hi">The Mani­feſtation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</span> Thus far have we opened in gene­ral the Subſtance of the <span class="hi">Keys,</span> and the Uſe of them. I come now to your <span class="hi">Queries.</span></p><p><span class="hi">Firſt,</span> You ask of the quality of the Apoſtles receiving this Pow­er, whether they had it as Judg­es <span class="hi">Authoritativè,</span> or as Meſſengers, <span class="hi">Declaratativè,</span> only to <span class="hi">propound,</span> or <span class="hi">denounce?</span> You manifeſt your ſelf <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3697"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=80">[Page 153]</a></span> for the former, and Reaſons you bring, ſuch as they be. Your Rea­ſons I ſhall conſider in their place, but I muſt firſt tell you that you ask amiſs, for your queſtion is concerning the whole Power of the <span class="hi">Keys,</span> but you anſwer only of a part, that is, of Sacramental Abſolution only, as if all the Pow­er of the <span class="hi">Keys</span> reſided there.

To your Queſtion then, whether the power of the <span class="hi">Keys</span> be declara­tive only, I anſwer firſt: For this latter part or half, it is meerly de­clarative, neither can it be other­wiſe; which that you may ſee with your eyes, I muſt requeſt you to obſerve, That all ſhutting of the Kingdom of Heaven, is ei­ther common to all, or caſual, befalling only ſome. The common <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3780"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=81">[Page 155]</a></span> Excluſion is that ſtate of Nature, wherein we all are involved, as we ſpring from the firſt <span class="hi">Adam;</span> The ſecond Excluſion is that which befals Chriſtians relapſing into ſin.

What active, what judiciary part can a­ny Miniſter of the Goſpel have here? all that the Apoſtles could do here, was but to open to men this their miſery, a thing, before the death of our Saviour, either very ſparingly, or not at all reveal­ed. Of this therefore you muſt needs quit your hands, and ſo you muſt of the other, I mean excluſi­on upon caſuality and relapſe. For when a man converted to Chriſtianity, falleth eftſoons into <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3791"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=82">[Page 156]</a></span> ſome mortal ſin, doth the Gate of Heaven ſtand open to him, till he fall upon ſome curſt Prieſt, that uſed his Key to ſhut it?</p><p>There are in the World a kind of deceitful Locks with ſliding Bolts, I have ſeen my ſelf and o­thers much deceived by them, when the doors have fallen at our heels, and lockt us out when we intended no ſuch thing. <span class="hi">Sir,</span> Hea­ven door hath a ſliding Lock, up­on occaſion of mortal ſin, it will ſhut without any uſe of a Key.</p><p>Perchance I do not well, <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, yet the ſober mean­ing of what I have ſpoken merrily, is but this, that either you muſt make the Miniſtry of the Goſpel only Declarative, or elſe it will follow that every impenitent Relapſer, that hath the good fortune to e­ſcape <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e3814"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=82">[Page 157]</a></span> the Prieſts being privy to his Sin, is like to find Heaven open at the laſt.

For it bringeth with it a peice of Doctrine which is ſeldom pleaſing to Superiors. To you for the preſent this ſhall ſuffice. If ſo be you be <span class="hi">Animo de­foecato,</span> if you have cleared your ſelf from froath and grownds, if neither ſloth, nor fears, nor am­bition, nor any tempting Spirits of that nature abuſe you, (for theſe and ſuch as theſe, are the true Im­pediments▪ why both that, and other Queſtions of the like danger are not truly anſwered) if all this <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4817"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=104">[Page 201]</a></span> be, and yet you ſee not how to frame your reſolution, and ſettle your ſelf for that doubt; I will ſay no more of you than was ſaid of <span class="hi">Papias,</span> St. <span class="hi">John's</span> own Scholar, you are <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, your abi­lities are not ſo good as I pre­ſumed.</p><p>But to go on with what I in­tended, and from which that in­terloping Queſtion diverted me; that you may the better judge of the nature of <span class="hi">Schiſms</span> by their oc­caſions; you ſhall find that all <span class="hi">Schiſms</span> have crept into the Church by one of theſe three ways; ei­ther upon matter of Fact, or mat­ter of Opinion, or point of Ambi­tion. For the firſt; I call that matter of Fact, when ſomething is required to be done by us, which either we know, or ſtrongly <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4855"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=105">[Page 202]</a></span> ſuſpect to be unlawful; So the firſt notable <span class="hi">Schiſm,</span> of which we read in the Church, contained in it matter of Fact; For it being upon Error taken for neceſſary, that an <span class="hi">Easter</span> muſt be kept; and upon worſe than Error, if I may ſo ſpeak, (for it was no leſs than a point of <span class="hi">Judaiſm,</span> forced up­on the Church,) upon worſe than Error, I ſay, thought further ne­ceſſary, that the ground for the time of our keeping that Feaſt, muſt be the rule left by <span class="hi">Moſes</span> to the <span class="hi">Jews;</span> there aroſe a ſtout Queſtion, Whether we were to celebrate with the <span class="hi">Jews,</span> on the fourteenth Moon, or the <span class="hi">Sun­day</span> following? This matter, though moſt unneceſſary, moſt vain, yet cauſed as great a Com­buſtion, as ever was in the <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4888"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=105">[Page 203]</a></span> Church; the <span class="hi">Weſt</span> ſeparating and refuſing Communion with the <span class="hi">Eaſt,</span> for many years together. In this fantaſtical Hurry, I cannot ſee but all the world were <span class="hi">Schiſma­ticks:</span> neither can any thing ex­cuſe them from that imputation▪ excepting only this, that we chari­tably ſuppoſe that all Parties out of Conſcience did what they did. A thing which befel them through the ignorance of their Guides, (for I will not ſay their malice) and that through the juſt judgment of God, becauſe through ſloth and blind obedience Men examined not the things which they were taught, but like Beaſts of Burthen patiently couched down, and in­differently underwent whatſoever their Superiours laid upon them. By the way; by this you may plain­ly <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4913"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=106">[Page 204]</a></span> ſee the danger of our appeal un­to Antiquity, for reſolution in con­troverted points of Faith, and how ſmall relief we are to expect from thence. For if the diſcretion of the chiefeſt Guides and Directors of the Church, did in a Point ſo tri­vial, ſo inconſiderable, ſo mainly fail them, as not to ſee the Truth in a Subject, wherein it is the great­eſt Marvel how they could avoid the ſight of it; can we without im­putation of extream groſneſs and folly, think ſo poor ſpirited per­ſons, competent Judges of the Queſtions now on ſoot betwixt the Churches? Pardon me; I know not what Temptation drew that Note from me.</p><p>The next <span class="hi">Schiſm,</span> which had in it matter of Fact, is that of the <span class="hi">Do­natiſt:</span> who was perſwaded (at <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4938"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=106">[Page 205]</a></span> leaſt ſo he pretended) that it was unlawful to converſe or commu­nicate in holy Duties with Men ſtained with any notorious Sin. (For howſoever <span class="hi">Auſtin</span> and others do ſpecify only the <span class="hi">Thurificati &amp; Traditores,</span> and <span class="hi">Libellatici,</span> and the like, as if he ſeparated only from thoſe, whom he found to be ſuch; yet by neceſſary proportion, he muſtrefer to all notorious Sinners) Upon this he taught, that in all pla­ces where good and bad were mixt together, there could be no Church, by reaſon of Pollution, evaporating as it were from Sin­ners, which blaſted righteous Per­ſons who converſed with them, and made all unclean. On this ground ſeparating himſelf from all whom he liſt to ſuſpect, he gave out that the Church was no <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e4958"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=107">[Page 206]</a></span> where to be found but in him and his Aſſociates, as being the on­ly Men among whom wicked Per­ſons found no ſhelter; and by conſequence, the only clean and unpolluted Company, and there­fore the only Church. Againſt this Saint <span class="hi">Auguſtine</span> laid down this Con­cluſion, <span class="hi">Unitatem Ecclesiae per totum Orbem diſperſae propter nonnullorum pec­cata non eſſe deſerendam;</span> which is in­deed the whole ſum of that Fa­thers Diſputation againſt the <span class="hi">Do­natiſt.</span> Now in one part of this Controverſie betwixt St. <span class="hi">Auguſtine</span> and the <span class="hi">Donatiſt,</span> there is one thing is very remarkable. The Truth was there where it was by meer chance, and might have been on either ſide▪ any Reaſons brought by either party notwithſtanding. For though it were <span class="hi">de facto</span> falſe, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5000"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=107">[Page 207]</a></span> that <span class="hi">pars Donati,</span> ſhut up in <span class="hi">Africk,</span> was the only Orthodox Party, yet it might have been true, notwith­ſtanding any thing Saint <span class="hi">Auſtine</span> brings to confute it; and on the contrary, though it were <span class="hi">de facto</span> true, that the part of Chriſtians diſ­perſed over the Earth were Ortho­dox; yet it might have been falſe notwithſtanding any thing Saint <span class="hi">Austine</span> brings to confirm it. For where, or amongſt whom, or amongſt how many the Church ſhall be, or is, is a thing indiffe­rent; it may be in any Number more or leſs, it may be in any Place Country, or Nation; it may be in All, and (for ought I know) it may be in none, without any prejudice to the definition of the Church, or the Truth of the Goſ­pel. <span class="hi">North</span> or <span class="hi">South,</span> many or few, <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5035"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=108">[Page 208]</a></span> diſperſed in many places, or con­fined to one; None of theſe ei­ther prove or diſprove a Church.</p><p>Now this <span class="hi">Schiſm,</span> and likewiſe the former, to a wiſe Man that well underſtands the matter in Controverſie; may afford per­chance matter of pity, to ſee Men ſo ſtrangly diſtracted upon fancy; but of doubt or trouble what to do, it can yield none. For though in this <span class="hi">Schiſm</span> the <span class="hi">Donatiſt</span> be the <span class="hi">Schiſmatick,</span> and in the former both parties be equally engaged in the <span class="hi">Schiſm;</span> yet you may ſafely upon your occaſions communicate with either, ſo be you flatter nei­ther in their <span class="hi">Schiſm:</span> For why might it not be lawful to go to Church with the <span class="hi">Donatiſt,</span> or to ce­lebrate <span class="hi">Eaſter</span> with the <span class="hi">Quartodeci­man,</span> if occaſion ſo require? ſince <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5080"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=108">[Page 209]</a></span> neither Nature, nor Religion, nor Reaſon doth ſuggeſt any thing to the contrary: For in all publick Meetings pretending Holineſs, ſo there be nothing done, but what true Devotion and Piety brook, why may not I be preſent in them, and uſe Communication with them? Nay what if thoſe to whoſe care the execution of the publick Service is committed, do ſome­thing either unſeemly or ſuſpici­ous, or peradventure unlawful? what if the Garments they wear be cenſured as, nay indeed be ſu­perſtitious? what if the Geſture of adoration be uſed at the Altar, as now we have learned to ſpeak? What if the <span class="hi">Homiliſt</span> or Preacher deliver any Doctrine, of the truth of which we are not well perſwa­ded, (a thing which very often <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5094"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=109">[Page 210]</a></span> falls out) yet for all this we may not ſeparate, except we be con­ſtrained perſonally to bear a part in them our ſelves. The Prieſts under <span class="hi">Eli</span> had ſo ill demeaned themſelves about the daily Sacri­fice, that the Scriptures tell us, they made it to ſtink, yet the People refuſed not to come to the Tabernacle, nor to bring their Sacrifice to the Prieſt. For in theſe <span class="hi">Schiſms,</span> which concern Fact, no­thing can be a juſt cauſe of refuſal of Communion, but only to re­quire the execution of ſome un­lawful or ſuſpected act; For not only in Reaſon, but in Religion too, that Maxim admits of no re­leaſe, <span class="hi">Cautiſſimi cujuſ<span class="expan"> <span class="ex">(que)</span></span> Praeceptum quod dubitas, ne feceris.</span> Long it was ere the Church fell upon <span class="hi">Schiſm</span> upon this occaſion, though of late <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5133"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=109">[Page 211]</a></span> it hath had very many; For until the ſecond Council of <span class="hi">Nice,</span> (in which conciliable Superſtition and Ignorance did conſpire) I ſay, un­till that Rout did ſet up Image­worſhip, there was not any re­markable <span class="hi">Schiſm,</span> upon juſt occaſi­on of Fact; All the reſt of <span class="hi">Schiſms</span> of that kind were but Wantonneſs, this was truly ſerious. In this the <span class="hi">Schiſmatical</span> party was the Synod it ſelf, and ſuch as conſpired with it. For concerning the uſe of Images in <span class="hi">Sacris,</span> Firſt, it is acknowledged by all, That it is not a thing neceſ­ſary; Secondly, It is by moſt ſuſ­pected; Thirdly, It is by many held utterly unlawful. Can then the enjoyning of the practice of ſuch a thing be ought elſe but a­buſe? Or can the refuſal of Com­munion here, be thought any other <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5168"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=110">[Page 212]</a></span> thing than duty? Here, or upon the like occaſion, to ſeparate, may peradventure bring perſonal trou­ble and danger, (againſt which it concerns every honeſt man to have <span class="hi">Pectus bene praeparatum</span>) further harm it cannot do. So that in theſe caſes, you cannot be to ſeek what to think, or what you have to do.</p><p>Come we then to conſider a little of the ſecond ſort of <span class="hi">Schiſm,</span> ariſing upon occaſion of variety of opinion. It hath been the com­mon diſeaſe of Chriſtians from the beginning, not to content themſelves with that meaſure of Faith, which God and Scriptures have expreſly afforded us; but out of a vain deſire to know more than is revealed, they have attempted to diſcuſs things, of which we can have no light, neither from <span class="additions" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5182"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=110">[Page 213]</a></span> Reaſon nor Revelation; neither have they reſted here, but upon pretence of Church-authority, which is none, or Tradition, which for the moſt part is but figment; they have peremptorily conclu­ded, and confidently impoſed up­on others, a neceſſity of entertain­ing Concluſions of that nature; and to ſtrengthen themſelves, have broken out into Diviſions and Factions, oppoſing man to man, Synod to Synod, till the peace of the Church vaniſhed, without all poſſibility of recall.

For if our Saviour did not manifeſt it, then might there be a thouſand Cauſes, which Mans Conjecture may eaſily miſs: It is great boldneſs, out of Cauſes concealed, to pick ſo great Con­ſequences, and to found Matters of ſo great weight upon meer Conjectures.</p><p>Thirdly, The Prayer for Con­firmation of <span class="hi">Peters</span> Faith, whence it came, the Courſe of the Story ſet down in the Text doth ſhew, It was our Saviours Previſion of <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5898"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=126">[Page 245]</a></span> <span class="hi">Peters</span> danger to relapſe, which danger he had certainly run into, had not our Saviour extraordinari­ly prayed for confirmation of his Faith. And the Precept of con­firming his Brethren, is but that charitable Office, which is exacted at every Chriſtians hand, that when himſelf had eſcaped ſo great a Wrack, to be careful in warning and reclaiming others, whom common frailty drives into the like Diſtreſs.</p><p>Theſe Circumſtances, that <span class="hi">Pe­ter</span> is firſt named amongſt the Di­ſciples, that he made the firſt Sermon, and the like, are too weak Grounds to build the Sove­raignty over the World upon; and that he ſpake <span class="hi">Ananias</span> and <span class="hi">Sapphira</span> dead, argues ſpiritual Power, but not temporal. But <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5926"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=127">[Page 246]</a></span> that <span class="hi">Peter</span> called the firſt Council in the <span class="hi">Acts,</span> is a Circumſtance beyond the Text; for concerning the calling of the Council there is no word, all that is ſaid is but this, <span class="hi">that the Diſciples and Elders met,</span> no Syllable of <span class="hi">Peters</span> calling them to­gether.</p><p>That <span class="hi">Peter</span> was 25 Years Bi­ſhop of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> is not to be proved out of Antiquity, before St. <span class="hi">Hie­rom,</span> who ſhuffled it into <span class="hi">Euſebius</span> Chronicle, there being no ſuch thing extant in his Story. Yea that he was Biſhop at all (as now the name of Biſhop is taken) may be very queſtionable: For the Ancients that reckon up the Bi­ſhops of <span class="hi">Rome</span> until their times, as <span class="hi">Euſebius,</span> and before him <span class="hi">Ter­tullian,</span> and before them both <span class="hi">Irae­neus,</span> never account <span class="hi">Peter</span> as Bi­ſhop <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e5985"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=127">[Page 247]</a></span> of that See: And <span class="hi">Epiphanius</span> tells us, that <span class="hi">Peter</span> and <span class="hi">Paul</span> were both Biſhops of <span class="hi">Rome</span> at once; by which it is plain he took the Title of Biſhop in another ſence than now it is uſed: For now, and ſo for a long time upward, two Biſhops can no more poſſeſs one See, than two Hedge-Spar­rows dwell in one Buſh. St. <span class="hi">Pe­ters</span> time was a little too early for Biſhops to riſe.</p></div><div class="part" id="index.xml-group.1_text.6_body.1_div.1_div.5"><h4><span class="headingNumber">1.5. </span><span class="head">Anſwer to the Biſhop of <span class="hi">Romes</span> Practice of Supremacy.</span></h4><p>To the firſt, That ſo many of the Biſhops of <span class="hi">Rome</span> were Mar­tyrs, what makes that to the pur­poſe?

Take for Example but the laſt of them. <span class="hi">Leo,</span> Biſhop of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> was deſirous that ſome things done in a meeting of Divines at <span class="hi">Epheſus,</span> ſhould be diſannulled; for this he becomes a Suitor to <span class="hi">Theodoſius</span> the <span class="hi">junior,</span> to have a General Council, but could never procure it of him. After his death he con­tinues his ſuit to <span class="hi">Marcianus,</span> Succeſ­ſor to <span class="hi">Theodoſius,</span> who granted his requeſt; But whereas <span class="hi">Leo</span> had re­queſted the Council might be held in <span class="hi">Italy,</span> the Emperor would not hear him; nay which is more, the Pope upon good reaſon, had be­ſought <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6115"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=129">[Page 250]</a></span> the Emperor to put off the day deſign'd for the holding of the Council, but the Emperor would not hear him. So that <span class="hi">Leo</span> could do nothing, neither for the calling the Council, nor for the Place, nor for the Time. And all this appears by <span class="hi">Leo's</span> own Epiſtles. If the Popes could do ſo little well near 500 years after Chriſt, how little could they do before, when their horns were not yet ſo long.</p><p>The Plea of the Proteſtants con­cerning the Corruption of the Church of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> which by them is confeſſed ſometimes to have been pure, is no more prejudicial to Chriſts Promiſe to his Church, <span class="hi">that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her,</span> than the known corruption of the Churches in <span class="hi">Aſia</span> in St. <span class="hi">Johns</span> time, or of other Churches after.</p><p>The Cloſe of all is a Demonſtra­tion. <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e6144"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39371&amp;page=129">[Page 251]</a></span> A Word unfortunately uſed by your Author, to bewray his Lo­gick: For indeed a Reaſon drawn from ſo poor and empty a ſign, falls many bows wide of demon­ſtrative Proof. Firſt, it is falſe that all the reſt of Patriarchal Sees are extinct. The See of <span class="hi">Conſtantinople</span> yet ſtands, and ſhews her Succeſſion of Biſhops from St. <span class="hi">Andrew</span> till this day, as well as the Church of <span class="hi">Rome</span> can from St. <span class="hi">Peter:</span> The See of <span class="hi">A­lexandria</span> yet ſubſiſts, and the Biſhop of that place calls him, <span class="gap" title="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"> [...]</span>, Judge of the World, (as my ſelf have ſeen in ſome of his Letters) a Title to which he hath as good Right, as the Biſhop of <span class="hi">Rome</span> hath to be the Worlds Sovereign.

And again, their caſe now is as good as was the Biſhops of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> under the <span class="hi">Eth­nick</span> Emperors; for their Lot then was no other than thoſe Biſhops is now. But grant that it had laſted longeſt, what then? ſome of them muſt needs have conſiſted longer than the other, except we would ſuppoſe that they ſhould have fallen all together.
