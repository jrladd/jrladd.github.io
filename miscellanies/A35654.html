One morning waiting on him at <span class="hi">Causham,</span> smiling upon me, he said he could tell me some news of my self, which was that he had seen some Verses of mine the evening before (be­ing those to Sir <span class="hi">R.

Since that time I never disobeyed my old Masters com­mands till this Summer at the Wells, my retirement there tempting me to divert those melancholy thoughts, which the new apparitions of Forreign invasion, and dome­stick discontent gave us: But these clouds being now happily blown over, and our Sun <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e264"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=39510&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> cleerly shining out again, I have recovered the relapse, it being suspected that it would have proved the Epidemical disease of age, which is apt to fall back into the follies in youth, yet <span class="hi">Socrates, Aristotle,</span> and <span class="hi">Cato</span> did the same, and <span class="hi">Scaliger</span> saith that Frag­ment of <span class="hi">Aristotle,</span> was beyond any thing that <span class="hi">Pindar</span> or <span class="hi">Homer</span> ever wrote.
