## 1\. An Anſwer For Mr. Calamie to a POEM Congratulating his impriſonment in
NEVV-GATE. Intituled by Robert Wilde. D.D. Author of the late Iter Boreale.

By J. R. Author of the late SMALL-BEER POEM.

‘Sic. partis componere Magna.’

THE place your Worſhip, doth congratulate,

Now void, doth for a new Incumbent wait.

I know none fitter, then your ſelf, to take it:

So pure a wit, a gainfull place, will make it.

Let me perſwade you, Begg the Preſentation;

And I ſhall tell you, for your conſolation,

What your own heart could wiſh, here you ſhall finde

A pack of Auditors, will fit your mind:

Conformiſts all, of the right ſtamp Cavalliers,

Whoſe prayers are oathes, and whoſe Religion Jeers.

Abuſe the Saints ſufficiently, and then,

You'l hear them all devoutly ſwear Amen.

You need not ſtudy much, nor break your brains:

There that is valued beſt, that coſts leaſt pains:

Stol'n Ware, or ſo; they love with all their heart,

If't be but done, as you can do't, with art.

Quote Guznian, and the Spaniſh Lazarill:

Among the reſt, let theſe be chiefeſt ſtill:

Een-Johnſon's playes with other moddern wits.

And Aulicus; Theſe you may quote by fits:

And read ſometimes, for it will much avail yee,

A piece, out of your Iter Boreale.

Be not aſham'd, of this advice; I tell you;

Your Betters have done ſo, that far excel you.

The Saints did once, as you know well enough,

Fill up their Sermons with Diurnall ſtuffe.

'Twas then well lik't. But oh the change of Fates!

Should we but do ſo now, they'd break our pates.

St. Peter's Chair, you need not envy mee:

Give me Sir John's: this other your's ſhall be.

St. Peter's Chair, was of dull Iron oare:

Yet he wrought miracle's: this will work more!

I'le tell you ſoftly, between you and I,

The godly have, a ſecret Deitie:

Though for to wrong him, they are ſomewhat ſhy;

Becauſe, the weak will call't Idolatry.

Your long Indictment, is not worth a ſtraw:

'Tis draw 'gainſt one, you ſay is dead in Law;

And who compar'd with you, may ſeem at moſt,

To be ſome Skelleton, or ſtarv'ling Ghoſt.

But ſee the rage of thoſe, Poetique Knaves!

They will not let us reſt, within our graves!

Then for the matter, of your accuſation,

'Tis ſo abſurd; it needs no confutation.

It is for ſtealing hearts; by this is mean't,

A Robbing of the party by conſent.

If this be Felony, Good-ſir, take heed!

For this will prove a dangerous theft indeed,

When you take tithes, and of men's monies fob them;

(Though by conſent) They may cry out, you rob them.

I like your, Allegory, of Biſhop Gout;

And ſo do others too, I make no doubt.

Some Preſbyterian Biſhop 'tis I Gueſſe;

For this is painfull, in his Dioceſſe.

What! though he make you grieve; 'tis for your good:

His viſitations, ſtir your idle blood.

God ſends ſuch viſiters, for Lazy droans:

Makes them unwilling, preach with ſobbs, and groanes.

Hee'l teach you too, without the Common-Prayer,

To cry, Ah! Lord! thy rotten Servant ſpare!

Would you be free, from Biſhop Gouts vexation?

I'le teach you how by the beſt obſervation.

Preach much but ſtudy little; for 'tis eaſe,

And idle ſitting, that breed's this diſeaſe.

Leave drinking ſack; get Caroſſes for your lungs;

And this will help you, to a thouſand tongues.

Preach, Preach, with all the noiſe, and vehemence you can!

Till you become ſome megger Puritan:

Subdue your pamp'red fleſh, with thinner diet;

And then, I'le promiſe you, you ſhall be quiet,

From Biſhop Gout, and from Dean Dropſy too;

They'l ſhun you then, as Lawyers, poor folkes do.

But to your praiſe, i'le ſpeak it, I proteſt!

Y'have prov'd Epiſcopacy, 'bove all, the beſt;

That they have Jus-Divinum, to their places;

You here have clearly prov'd it to their faces:

Now my Lord Gout, may with good grace and ſenſe,

Writ Biſhop, by Divine providence.

For 'twas not man, but God gave him Commiſſion;

And fixt in your precinct, his jurisdiction.

And may his Government prove ſomewhat milde!

Or elſe I fear 'twill make the Doctor Wilde.

But more then this; you have prov'd learnedly;

Far above others, their Antiquity:

As old as Father Noah, I Divine:

Who planted firſt, the Gont-producing Vine.

Thus you have ſtopt, the mouthes of peeviſh ſects;

And cleer'd the queſtion, in deſpite of Smects.

Much joy have you, with your Dioceſan!

May he nere meet, with any Puritan.

Or Lawleſs Schiſmatiques! but make them bow,

To his commands! or plague them! you know how.

May he find none, where ere he Domineers;

But good conformiſts honeſt Cavalliers!

But Sir! there's yet one ſcruple left behind;

Which not a litle, doth perplex my mind.

The narrow Dioceſſe, you do al ot,

Unto your Biſhop doth not any jot.

Advance your cauſe; but for all this you may,

Be counted one, of th' Independ ent way.

No further then your ſelf, your Biſhop reaches:

This every Quaker and Phanatick teaches.

'Tis Large enough, (you'l ſay) for every man,

A little world! his Soul Dioceſan!

Sir! this is Popery; I'le make it plain!

An Univerſall Biſhop, you ordain!

But now let's ſee, where all this ſickneſs lies!

You, if you can, A remedy deviſe

When States ſhall breed, more learned, active Spirits,

Then they can keep or anſwer to their merits;

You muſt not think, they'l ſtarve or beggar be,

If by their Rhet'rick, they can earn a Fee.

Whil'ſt Ideots, Women, Hawkes and Hounds devour:

The fatteſt tithes, once the poor Churches Dower.

Whil'ſt the impropriate Lord, will not conſent,

To yeild his needy vicar, Ten per cent;

You muſt not think it ſtrange, if diſcontents,

Work in the Church and State ſuch fatall rents;

And that compell'd men ſeek Benevolence,

From better Chriſtians honeſt Citizens.

Let this be Remedied, all Schiſmes will fail,

And none will then preſume to write or raile.

Who ſo doth otherwiſe, the Symptomes cures;

But not the Malady: that ſtill endures.

We Love the King, and would his love deſerve,

If Preaching will not; then our pray'rs muſt ſerve!

Make you the empty air, wit Clamours ring.

Our Prayers ſhall reach to heaven! God Save the King!

FINIS.
