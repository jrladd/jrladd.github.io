I in my mellancholie walkes be thought me of the strange inuasion of Sathan, lately on the persons of <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell,</span> and her bloody louer <span class="hi">Iefferie Bownd,</span> together with that vntimely actor <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> widdow, howe that vglie fiende (euer mans fatall opposite) had made practise, but I hope not purchase, of theyr corruptible liues, &amp; brought them to the last steppe of mortall miserie. And then revoluing with my selfe, the great goodnes of God, in calling sinners to repentance, and withall, admiring his gifts in the pe­nitent, I could no lesse then write my harts trouble, as well to pertake the world with my meditation, as to make them vvon­der at this <span class="hi">Cheshiere</span> chaunce; and thereby to plant or to engraft a kinde of feare by this way of example, howe murder should heereafter beare any braine in sensible creatures, considering how the very stones shal bewray the inward thoughts of massa­ker. All these considered, when I had coted this wonder, thin­king how incredulous our Nation is in things true, and how vn­certaine they are to beleeue fopperies fayned, I could no lesse for the certaintie heereof, but call you to witnesse of the proofe, because sith such an example was preferd vnto vs, that others, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e341"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=3">[Page]</a></span> not eye witnes therevnto, might the rather assure themselues of the same. First, I knowing your generall griefes for the fall of so good a Gentlewoman, and when no remedy could be, to comfort such a godly soule, aswell in her time of imprisonment as at the houre of her death, my owne occasions also for that time considered, and beeing your true and naturall Country­man, I could doe no lesse but ostend my dutious loue to you all in this kinde, desiring you to accept my poore mite, onely considering this, the poore mans plenty is prayer to regrate your worthy loues, &amp; as truly as I liue, that shall be no niggard; for that night wherein I lie me downe, and pray not for you all, let my rest be broad-waking slumbers, and my quiet, waking dreames; and that will be punishment more then I would en­ioy for so regardlesse a good as I so late and so happily recea­ued. True it is that diuers reports passed vp and downe the streets of Loudon as touching this act of murder, but how scan­delously, as fiue murdred, three murdred by the meanes of six persons, which your VVorships know is false, only three mur­dered one; marry the intent was to him that now liues. There­fore being an eare-witnes to this false alarum, it made me more diligent in the setting foorth the truth, whereby GOD in his power might be knowne, sathan in his meaning no doubt ouer­throwne, and the worlds idle fabling by a contrary meaning knowne. For as it was, it was, and no otherwise, and thus it was, as your presences both at the examination, arraignement, and execution can iustifie; and how odious it is to heare any truth rackt by slaundering tongues, iudge or imagine; onely this, pardon my boldnes, witnes the right, accept my good will in the publishing; and so I commit you to Gods protection.</p><div class="closer"><div class="signed">Your poore Countryman, euer yours, <span class="hi">Gilbert Dugdale.</span></div></div></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul class="toc toc_front"><li class="toc"><a class="toc toc_0" href="#index.xml-front.1_div.2">To the right vertuous, the Ladie Marie Cholmsly, &amp; the right worshipfull these Knights; Sir Tho: Houlcroft, Sir Iohn Sauadge of Egerton, Sir Iohn Egerton, Sir Peter VVarborton, Sir Rowland Stanly, Sir Vrian Leigh, Sir Tho: Aston, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Tho: Sauadge, Sir George Leister, Sir VVilliam Damport, Sir Tho: Stanly, Sir George Booth, Sir Henry Bunberry, Sir Hukin Beeston, Sir Richard Wilbrome, Sir Richard Brooke, Sir Richard Egerton, Ma.

But by many and often assaults and in­couragements, their perswasions did worke with her, and tooke effect; the which being obtained, then were they as busie as before, deuising which way, to set their deuillish and most hellish practises aworke, preferring many deuises for the accomplishment thereof. And shee often times entring into consideration with her selfe, what a damnable part it was, first to abuse her husbands bed, and then in seeking to depriue him of his life, was greatly tor­mented in her conscience, and diuers times, earnestlie in­treated them to surcease in this practise, laying before them the great and heauie punishments, prouided for such offenders both in this world, and in the world to come: but their harts being so deeply possest by that filthy enimy to all goodnes, that there was nothing to them more odi­ous then such perswasions, still perseuered in there former wicked inuensions, and drew her to associate them in this villany, laying many plots for the performing of it, a­mongst which <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> as she was verie expert in such like actions, beeing an ancient motherly woman, and to all mens iudgements in her outward habite, was farre from harboring such a thought, yet as I was about to say, she aduised <span class="hi">Bownd</span> to giue to a brother of hers, namely, <span class="hi">George Fernley,</span> fiue pounds, &amp; she would perswade him, that he should vse some meanes to murder <span class="hi">Caldwell,</span> the which <span class="hi">Bownd</span> agreed vnto, being that to him all her mo­tions <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e467"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> were medicines, and for that her house was the place, that <span class="hi">Bownd</span> and <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> did resort for there meeting place, and he hauing an intent to further this matter, caused this <span class="hi">Fernley</span> to be sent for, and confer­red with him: and hee being a man slenderly furnished with meanes, agreed to this there motion, affirming, that he would delay no time till hee had effected their desire, though in my conscience hee pretended nothing lesse, but onely to sooth them with faire words, for lucre of the money, made a showe to <span class="hi">Bownd</span> as if he were verie dil­ligent about the execution thereof, but still was preuented, in so much that <span class="hi">Bownd</span> entered into a great rage with the poore fellow, and swore most terribly, if hee did not dis­patch his busines withall expedition, he would lay him by the heeles for his fiue pounds.</p><p>Notwithstanding, hee made delaies so many, that the old for, I meane <span class="hi">Halls</span> wife deuised with her selfe of ano­ther course, &amp; willed <span class="hi">Bownd</span> to buy some Ratsbane, and she would minister it in Oaten-cakes for that she knewe <span class="hi">Caldwell</span> much affected them, and they being made, his wife should giue them vnto him, and so procure his speedy dispatch. Which deuise he verie willingly consented vnto, and vsed no delay in the matter, but presently repared to a towne in <span class="hi">Cheshiere</span> called <span class="hi">Knutsforth,</span> there bought the poyson, and brought it to <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell,</span> and wished her to send it to <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> with all speede, wherevppon she receiued it, and instantly vppon the receite thereof, <span class="hi">Halls</span> wife sent her maide to <span class="hi">Elizabeth,</span> and willed her to send the spice she spoke to her for: so the maide innocently went as her dame commanded her, and receiued the poy­son, and brought it to the sayd <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> her dame, who presently did take it, and minister it, (as I sayd before) in oaten-cakes: the which being done, she sent them to <span class="hi">Eliza­beth Caldwell,</span> where she and her husband did soiourne; wherevppon, being in the euening, she layd them in her chamber windowe. In the morning next ensuing, <span class="hi">Cald­well,</span> as his accustomed manner was, rose verie earlie, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e539"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> and his wife still keeping her bed, he spied the cakes lie in the windowe, and demaunded of her if he might take any of them, she answered, yea, all if he would, and therevpon he tooke some three or foure of them, and went into the house, and called for some butter to eate them with, the which was brought him.</p><p>But let me tell you by the way, so soone as he was de­parted the chamber with the cakes, feare draue such a ter­ror to her hart as she lay in bed, as she euen trembled with remorse of conscience, yet wanted she power to call to him to refraine them, insomuch as he himselfe did not onely eate of them, but the most part of the folkes in the house, children and all, yet God bestowed his blessing so bounti­fully on them, as they were all preserued from daunger, sauing one little girle which could not so wel disgest them, which was a neighbours child of sixt or seauen yeares old, and comming in by chance for fier: to the which maister <span class="hi">Caldwell</span> gaue a peece of acake, and she eate it, and by rea­son she had beene long before visited with sicknes, shee went home and died presently, while the rest by way of vomit were saued. But that which maistar <span class="hi">Caldwell</span> did vomit vp againe, two doggs and a cat did eate, and they died presently also. Whether vppon the force of that poyson or no the childe died I cannot say, but well I knowe, they were all three brought within the com­passe of murder for the death of it, and were all executed at <span class="hi">Chester</span> for the same fact, as you shall heareafter vn­derstand.</p><p>Upon the death of this child, <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> was apprehended, and brought before three Iustices of the peace; namely, Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Sauage,</span> Sir <span class="hi">Thomas Aston,</span> and maister <span class="hi">Brooke</span> of <span class="hi">Norton,</span> where before them she truly confessed all their practises and proceedings from the be­ginning, euen till that day. Upon which confession, <span class="hi">Bownd</span> and <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> were apprehended, and brought before the same Iustices, and examined as touching the murder, and they very stoutly denied all, afferming that <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e591"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> they were not guiltie to any such action, although her con­fession in her Examination did manifest against them, bee­ing layd to their charge: all which would not mooue them to acknowledge their fault, the deuill hauing so great a commaund ouer them. Notwithstanding, they were all committed to the Castell of <span class="hi">Chester,</span> there to remaine with out Baill or Maineprise, till they should be deliuered by due course of Lawe, according to the tenure of warrants directed in such a case.</p><p>So the Assise approching within few dayes after theyr commitment, their causes and tryall for that time was re­iourned, till the next great Assises holden there. And whe­ther it was by speciall meanes of <span class="hi">Bownd</span> made to the Iudge, or for that <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> was with childe, I cannot truly say, but there they continued from that time, beeing a senight after Easter, till Michelmas following: during which time they were not admitted one to speake to another. And for <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell,</span> from her first en­trance into prison, till the time of her death, there was ne­uer heard by any, so much as an idle word to procéede out of her mouth, neither did shée omit any time, during her imprisonment, in seruing of GOD, and séeking pardon for her sinnes, with great zeale and industrie, continually meditating on the Bible, excluding her selfe from all com­panie, sauing such as might yéelde her spirituall comforts, as learned Diuines, and such, the faithfull seruaunts of God. There was many of all sorts resorted to sée her, as no fewer some daies then thrée hundred persons: and such as she thought were viciously giuen, shee gaue them good admonitions, wishing that her fall might be an example vnto them.</p><p>Thus the deceitfull deuill, who hath sometime permis­sion from GOD to attempt the very righteous, (as <span class="hi">lob)</span> was now an instrument to her sorrow, but her feeling faith the more increased, and no doubt <span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>o her comfort, though in our eyes terrible: for indéede so it ought, béeing sent from God as an example to thousands. For where so <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e634"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> many liue, one or two pickt out by the hand of God, must serue as an example to the rest, to kéepe thousands in feare of Gods wrath, and the worlds terror. But sée her con­stancie. All the time of her imprisonment, she vsed all pos­sible meanes, both of herselfe, and by those good members that did visit her, to conuert all the rest of the prisoners, which good worke begunne in her did take good effect, for she sent some dayes a dozen Letters to seuerall Preachers to be resolued as touching her fayth, and the want of a sound resolution that GOD had parsoned her offences. Where the Lady <span class="hi">Mary Cholmsly</span> of <span class="hi">Cholmsly</span> amongst others, together with the comfortable reliefe of one Mai­ster <span class="hi">Iohn Battie,</span> (no doubt both Gods Children) so relie­ued, as want neuer grieued her conscience, but that shee continued in zeale, without griefe of the worldes offences both in soule and body: nay, not onely her, but also to the rest of the prisoners. For note, that death neuer feared or daunted her, but onely fearing shée was not fully purged from her sinnes, till at the end, as by her words at her ex­ecution appeareth.</p><p>This foresaide Maister <span class="hi">Battie</span> well deserues a due re­membrance for his clemencie and charitie shewed to that distressed and deceased poore soule, by whose good meanes, which in méere compassion by him extended, did not onely receiue comforts for her bodily reléefe, but also great satis­faction for her soule, hee oft imployed such industry to the Learned, both to repare vnto her themselues, as likewise daily in sending vnto her good and learned instructions: Surely, he deserues to be registred in the harts of all well disposed persons, and his demerits (no doubt) will finde restitution at the handes of him, who is the Pay-Maister for all such charitable deserts.</p><p>It is also to be noted, that after these thrée aforenamed persons had remained in prison all the whole Summer, at Michelmas then ensuing the Assises were holden, and <span class="hi">E­lizabeth Caldwell</span> had her triall, where shee openly before the Iudges, and the rest of the Worshipfull Audience, ac­knowledged <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e675"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=6">[Page]</a></span> her offence: for the which shee first demaun­ded pardon at the hands of God, then of her husband, last­ly of all the world: and desiring, as it was euer her pray­er, that she might be as a Looking-glasse to all that eyther did sée or heare of her fall, that by her they might sée into theyr owne frailines, and the infirmities which are sub­iect to the flesh. And hauing, as I said, acknowledged her guiltines, was condemned. And by reason shee was not then deliuered of child, still repriued: and at y<sup>e</sup> same Assise <span class="hi">Bownd</span> was indited: and whether by euill counsell giuen him, or for his owne obstinacie, I cannot truly report, but he would not answer to the Articles obieced against him, nor refer his cause to GOD and the Country, but stoode mute, though the Iudges very earnestly mooued him to put his cause to triall: all which would not perswade him, and therefore, according to the Law, he was adiudged to be prest, receiuing his iudgement on the Saturday, to be executed on Munday following. And for <span class="hi">Isabell Hall,</span> her matter that Assise was not called in question, which yéel­ded her such incouragement, that shee was altogether re­gardlesse of the good of her soule.</p><p>But <span class="hi">Bownd,</span> euer before he perceiued how hee should spéede, pleaded to euery one whom he had any communi­on with, of his innocencie, till he saw no hope of life: then hée, before two or thrée Preachers, and others, did mani­fest the whole truth, and affirmed that flesh and blood was not able to endure the often assaults that <span class="hi">Elizabeth Cald­well</span> had of him, and <span class="hi">Isabell Hall:</span> and vppon the Munday about nine of the clocke, was prest: where to euery mans iudgement there present, hee made a very penitent end, béeing hartily sorrowfull for his offences, and very de­uoutly craued pardon of GOD and all the world, and so died (I trust) the true seruaunt of Iesus Christ.</p><p>Then that night next after his death, <span class="hi">Elizabeth Cald­well</span> was deliuered of a boy, which child is yet as I take it, still liuing with another boy she had before her impre­sonment, the which are at the keeping of <span class="hi">Caldwell</span> their <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e732"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> father, and as it was generally reported, hee made sute to the Iudge to procure a warrant to haue his wife executed, within a certaine time after her deliuerie; but how true it was that he made such meanes, I cannot truly affirme, but sure I am, a warrant was granted and sent the keeper for to haue her executed, within 13 daies or there­abouts after she was deliuered, the which was conuented by reason the Cunstable of the castle, did mistake the deli­uerie of the warrant to the Sheriffe till the date was out. Though she a senight before the time, had prepared her selfe, only to receiue the mercy of God, and terror of death, yet it pleased God otherwise a while to prolong her daies, which time giuen her, she did not vainely spend, but im­ploy her vttermost indeuors to obtaine mercie, and for­giuenes in such rare sort, as if I should discribe the per­ticulers thereof, it would not only be endlesse, and tedi­ous, but I doubt, to the hearers and readers, it would be though incredable, for in her might be seene the true image of a penitent sinner, as the like hath not often in these daies beene seene, God showing his glory so aboundantlie, working her penitency, as to me, and many more, was most admirable. For if she espied in any one, of what cal­ling or degree soeuer, that they wilfully or carelesly abused Gods holy ordinaunces, shee would reproue them for it, and curtiously intreate them to amend such and such a­buses; though some disdained she should seeme so to doe, in regard of her owne former offence, though indeede none might better doe it then shee, hauing smarted euen at her soule for her sinnes. This is the frailnes of our flesh, we only disdaine not our afflicted bretheren, but also there good admonitions: God of his mercy I beseech him giue vs grace, that we may sée into our fickle estates, and receiue willingly any reprofe that may tend to the good of our poore soules.</p><p>So by this meanes, as I showed you before, this <span class="hi">Eli­zabeth Caldwell</span> was still detained in prison till the next Assise following, at what time <span class="hi">Isabell Hall</span> was indited, as <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e763"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=7">[Page]</a></span> an actor in this murder, and found guilty by the Iurie, condemned and executed. And <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> also re­ceiued the death of execution at the same instant, though my Lady <span class="hi">Cholmsley</span> very worshipfull and louingly made earnest sute, vnto the Iudge for her depriue till the Assise following: y<sup>•</sup> which by no meanes would be granted. And she seeing her sute would not take effert, being very sor­rowfull, like a kind Ladie, went vnto <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> her selfe, and showed her she could not therein preuaile for her.</p><p>Indeede my Lady and others had an intent, if they could haue got her repriue, to haue vsed meanes to the King for a petition, but seeing it would not be, <span class="hi">Elizabeth</span> dutifully yéelded thanks vnto her Ladiship; and said shée was very well content to receiue the death ordained for her.

Praying likewise for all those that ministred comforts vnto her in her misery and distresses, that the Lord would blesse them, and con­tinue them faithfull vnto the end.</p><p>Then forgiuing, and asking forgiuenes of all, making her selfe ready, saying her bodily death did not dismay her, concluding with these her last words, Lord Iesus re­ceiue my spirit: and so she left this miserable world, and dyed the true seruaunt of Iesus Christ, the xviij. day of Iune, 1603.</p><p><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e1084"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=11341&amp;page=14">[Page]</a></span> ¶ Nowe yet againe remember our old beldame afore­named, that vncharitable creature <span class="hi">Isabell Hall,</span> widdow, béeing the onely instrument of this timelesse action: who standing on the Ladder, and ready to suffer for her fact, did notwithstanding very stoutly denie euery thing that had beene doone in theyr late procéedings, nay and abiurd it, had not <span class="hi">Elizabeth Caldwell</span> with affirmation of all in­serted her confession in that behalfe: Who with an easie repentance to the worlds eye, ended her life.

And to the whole world it may seeme strange, that a Gentlewoman so vvell brought vp in Gods feare, so well married, so ver­tuous euer, so suddainly wrought to this act of murder; that when your Ladiship doth read aswell the Letter as the Booke, of her owne indighting, you will the more wonder that her vertues coulde so aptly tast the follies of vice and villanie. But so it was, and for the better proofe that it was so, I haue placed my kinsmans name to it, who was present at all her troubles, at her comming to prison, her bee­ing in prison, and her going out of prison to execu­tion.
