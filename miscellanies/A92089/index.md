## 1\. THE RVMP ULULANT, OR PENITENCE per FORCE; BEING. The Recantation of the
old ruſt-roguy-rebellious-rampant, And now ruinous rotten-roſted RUMP.

To the Tune of Gerrards Miſtreſſe.

FArewell

Falſe Honours, and uſurped Power Farewell,

For the great Bell

Of Juſtice rings in our affrighted Ears.

The Gripes,

Of wounded Conſcience far exceed all Stripes,

Yet are ſmall Types,

Of thoſe ſharp Payns Rebellion juſtly fears,

See how,

Th' unmasked People hiſſe us out of Doors,

And call us Knaves,

Becauſe though We, Their Servants be,

We made them but our Slaves.

For ſince

We layd the Country waſt like ravenenous Bores,

They ſeek our Blouds,

Becauſe we prize, their Liberties,

But to devour their Goods.

Our Hands

We dip'd in Royal Bloud, to have his Lands

At our Commands,

And made three Kingdoms headleſs at one Blow,

The Strife

We caus'd was chiefly to cut off his Life,

With curſed Knife;

He that was Vertues Friend, muſt be our Foe.

We made

Religion do our Drudgery to baſe Ends,

But now we find,

They that do ſow Pretences, mow

A Harveſt of the Wind.

And now

When clamorous Vengeance Calling for Amends

Begins our Grief,

Our Friend the Devil, with his Evil,

Can give us no Relief.

Go ſearch

All Lands beneath the Suns Star-ſpangled Perch,

You'll find no Church

Like Ours, whilſt reverend BISHOPS held the Chayr.

But thoſe

We knew with our Deſigns would never cloſe;

And therefore choſe

In their ſteads to ſet up Extempore Prayer.

Poached Eyes

And words twang'd through a whining Lecturers Noſe,

Did fill our Purſes,

That many have Rings, and better Things,

Which now give only Curſes.

And thus

Hell was our Text, though Heav'n were our Gloze,

And Will our Reaſon,

Religion we made free of Hocus trade,

And voted Loyalty Treaſon.

Since We

With wicked Arms have made the Croſier flee,

Errour is free,

To lay her Nets, to make weak Minds her Prize.

All Sects,

Schiſmes, curſed Hereſies with ſtubborn Necks,

Corrupt our Texts,

And Crane up Scripture to maintain their Lyes.

You ſee

The Crop-ear'd Anabaptiſt ſowing Tares

In every Ground,

Though the Plagues of Warr, wherever they Are

The Church and State Confound.

So do

The Roman Noſes vend their Popiſh Wares,

By Twylight ſtill;

And the Quaker halfmad, though he looks ſo ſad,

Grinds in the Jeſuites Mill.

Our Drums

Did drown your Proceſſe, and your Writes; our Plums,

Bid kiſs our Bums,

We ſent your Laws and Perſons to the Tower:

From whence

To be deliver'd, 'Twas in vain to Fence

By talking Sence;

No Habeas Corpus in the Court of Power.

The Gown

Did ſtoop his reverend Velvet to a Crew

In ſhort red Coats,

Who many a Day, Have made you pay,

For cutting your own Throats.

We rob'd

The Whole of Food to pamper up the Few,

Excis'd your Wares,

And tax'd you round, Six pence the Pound,

And maſſacred your Bears.

But now

Diſpayrs black clowds do hang upon our Brow,

For All do Bow,

Their Hearts, to their true Shepheard, Charles their King.

And We

Their Wolfiſh Rulers now muſt Subjects be

To Deſtiny,

And end our Juncto in a fatal String.

Then learn

All future Traytors by our Tragick Doom,

E're 'tis too late;

Leſt when you make, Kingdoms to ſhake,

You Copy out our Fate.

We know

Our High Affronts to Church and State make Room

For Us in Hell;

But yet We'll Hope, till the ſad Rope

Sayes, Bid the World Farewell.

‘Facit Indignatio Verſum.’

FINIS.
