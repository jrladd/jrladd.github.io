## 1\. The Famous Battel between Robin Hood, and the Curtal Fryar.

To a New Northern Tune.

Figure 1. Robin Hood.

Figure 2. The Curtal Fryar.

### 1.1.

IN Summer time when leaves grow green

and flowers are freſh and gay,

Robin Hood and his merry men,

were diſpoſed to play:

Then ſome would leap and ſome would Run,

and ſome would uſe Artillery,

Which of you can a good Bow draw,

a good Archer to be?

Which of you can kill a Buck?

or who can kill a Doe?

Or who can kill a Hart of Greece,

five hundred foot him fro?

Will Scadlock he kill'd a Buck,

and Midge he kill'd a Doe;

And little John kill'd a Hart of Greece,

five hundred foot him fro:

Gods bleſſing on thy heart, ſaid Robin Hood

that ſhot ſuch a ſhoot to me,

I would ride my Horſe an hundred miles,

to find one could match thee.

That cauſed Will Scadlock to laugh,

he laught full heartily,

There lives a curtal Fryar in Fountain-Abby

will beat both him and thee.

Robin Hood put on his Harneſs good,

and on his head a Cap of Steel,

Broad Sword and Buckler by his ſide,

and they became him weel.

He took his Bow into his hand,

it was of a truſty tree,

With a Sheaf of Arrows at his Belt,

to the Fountains Dale went he.

And coming unto Fountains Dale,

no farther would he ride.

There was he ware of a Curtal Fryar,

walking by the water ſide.

The Fryar had a Harneſs good,

and on his head a Cap of Steel,

Broad Sword and Buckler by his ſide,

and they became him weel.

Robin Hood lighted off his Horſe,

and tyed him to a thorn,

Carry me over the water thou Curtal Fryar,

or elſe thy life's forlorn.

The Fryar took Robin Hood on his back,

deep water he did beſtride,

And ſpake neither good word nor bad,

till he came at the other ſide.

Lightly ſtept Rob. Hood off the Fryars back,

the Fryar ſaid to him again,

Carry me over the water thou fine fellow,

or it ſhall breed thy pain.

Robin Hood took the Fryar on his back,

deep water he did beſtride,

And ſpeak neither good word nor bad,

till he came at the other ſide.

Lightly leapt the Fryar off Robin Hoods back

Robin Hood ſaid to him again,

Carry me over the water thou Curtal Fryar,

or it ſhall breed thy pain.

The Fryar took Robin Hood on's back again

and ſtept up to the knee,

Till he came at the middle ſtream,

neither good nor bad ſpake he.

And coming to the middle ſtream,

there he threw Robin in,

And chuſe thee, chuſe thee, fine fellow,

with thou wilt ſink or ſwim.

### 1.2. The ſecond part,

to the ſame Tune.

Robin Hood ſwam to a buſh of Broom,

the Fryar to a wigger wand,

Bold Robin Hood is gone to the ſhore,

and took his Bow in hand.

One of his beſt Arrows under his Belt,

to the Fryar he let flye,

The Curtal Fryar with his Steel Buckler,

he put that Arrow by.

Shoot on, ſhoot on, thou fine fellow,

ſhoot as thou haſt begun,

If thou ſhoot here a Summers day,

thy mark I will not ſhun.

Robin Hood ſhot ſo paſſing well,

till his Arrows were all gone,

They took their Swords and ſteel Bucklers,

they fought with might and main,

From ten o'th Clock that day,

till four i'th Afternoon,

Then Robin Hood came to his knees,

of the Fryar to beg a boon.

A boon, a boon, thou Curtal Fryar,

I beg it on my knee,

Give me leave to ſet my Horn to my mouth,

and to blow blaſts three.

That will I do, ſaid the Curtal Fryar,

of thy blaſts I have no doubt,

I hope thou'lt blow ſo paſſing well,

till both thy eyes fall out.

Robin Hood ſet his Horn to his mouth,

he blew out blaſts three,

Half a hundred Yeomen with Bows bent,

came ranging over the Lee.

Whoſe men are theſe, ſaid the Fryar,

that come ſo haſtily?

Theſe men are mine, ſaid Robin Hood,

Fryar, what is that to thee.

A boon, a boon, ſaid the Curtal Fryar,

the like I gave to thee,

Give me leave to ſet my Fiſt to my mouth,

and to whute whutes three.

That will I do, ſaid Robin Hood,

or elſe I were to blame,

Three whutes in a Fryars Fiſt,

would make me glad and fain.

The Fryar he ſet his Fiſt to his mouth,

and whuted whutes three,

Half a hundred good bay Dogs,

came running the Fryar unto.

Here is for every man a Dog,

and I my ſelf for thee.

Nay by my faith quoth Robin Hood,

Fryar that may not be.

Two Dogs at once to Robin Hood did go,

the one behind the other before,

Robin Hoods Mantle of Lincoln green,

off from his back they tore.

And whether his men ſhot Eaſt or Weſt,

or they ſhot North or South,

The Cutrtles Dogs ſo taught they were,

they caught the Arrows in their mouth.

Take up thy Dogs, ſaid little John,

Fryar at my bidding be,

Whoſe man art thou, ſaid the Curtal Fryar,

comes here to p [...]ate with me?

I am little John, Robin Hoods man,

Fryar I will not lye,

If thou take not up thy Dogs ſoon,

i'le take up them and thee.

Little John had a Bow in his hand,

he ſhot with might and main,

Soon half a ſcore of the Fryars Dogs,

lay dead upon the plain.

Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, ſaid the Curtal Fryar,

thy Maſter and I will agree,

And we will have new orders taken,

with all the haſt that may be.

If thou wilt forſake fair Fountain Dale,

and Fountain-Abby free.

Every Sundy through the year,

a Noble ſhall be thy fee.

And every Holiday through the year

changed ſhall thy Garments be,

If thou wilt go to fair Nottingham,

and there remain with me.

This Curtal Fryar had kept Fountain Dale,

ſeven long years and more,

There was neither Knight, Lord nor Earl[?]

could make him yield before.
