Whether their placing armed Gards that Evening at the House, and all approaches to it and the next Morning too, and giving <span class="hi">Colonel Okey,</span> and <span class="hi">Colonel Alured</span> (the Commanders of their Gards) their <span class="hi">Serjeant</span> and <span class="hi">Door-keepers, strict special Commands and Orders, not to suffer any of the old secluded Members</span> so much as to come into the <span class="hi">outward Lobby</span> before <span class="hi">the House,</span> (whether Footboys, Apprentices, and other Persons of all sorts had free ac­cess,) much lesse to enter into the <span class="hi">House</span>; and their forcible secluding of Sir <span class="hi">Gilbert Gerard,</span> Sir <span class="hi">Anthony Irby,</span> Sir <span class="hi">William Waller,</span> Sir <span class="hi">Iohn Evelin,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Ans­ley, Serjeant Maynard,</span> Mr. <span class="hi">Prynne,</span> and 15. other Members more on Tuesday morning, <span class="hi">Decemb.</span> 27. out of the very Lobby, in pursuance of their Orders, till they crowded into the <span class="hi">Lobby</span> by degrees against the <span class="hi">Door-keepers,</span> and <span class="hi">Gards</span> wills, who at first oft shut the Doors against them, though they admitted Ap­prentices, and others to pass in and out: And their seclusion of them out of the <span class="hi">House</span> when in the <span class="hi">Lobby,</span> by keeping the House door fast locked against them, and ordering the <span class="hi">Door-keeper and Serjeant not to open it,</span> notwithstanding many demands to open it, and Messages to them for that purpose, which they slighted; not vouchsafing to take any notice of, after two full hours attendance by the Members on them in the <span class="hi">Lobby</span>; nor so much as sending any <span class="hi">Member,</span> nor their Serjeant out to them; as they usually do to every ordinary Petitioner, or person attending them upon publick or private occasi­ons; Be not a just ground and provocation for these and all other secluded Members, (being about 4. times more in number and interest to those then sitting, and the real <span class="hi">House of Commons,</span>) with all the respective Counties, Cities, Boroughs, Ports for which they serve, with as high co<span class="gap" title="••"> [...]</span>empt and scorn to neglect them and their <span class="hi">illegal Conventicle,</span> (not the tenth part of a Commons House,) to protest against all their Votes, Proceedings as <span class="hi">null and void to all intents,</span> and not to <span class="hi">yield the least obedience</span> to any <span class="hi">Orders, Votes,</span> or <span class="hi">Commands</span> of theirs, till all the Members be freely admitted without any restrictions, to sit and act amongst them; it being both their <span class="hi">Privile<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>e, Birthright,</span> and <span class="hi">Inheritance,</span> and they obliged by their <span class="hi">Protestation,</span> and <span class="hi">Solemn League and Covenant,</span> con­stantly, zealously and chearfully to defend the same with their Lives and Estates against all Violations, <span class="hi">all the daies of their lives</span>; and therefore now if ever, in this sad posture of publick distractions?</p><p>3. Whether this their disdainfull, uncivil, unbrotherly Treating of their fellow-Members (desiring nothing else but a brotherly association with them, to compose the manifold Distractions, and make up the wide Breaches of our Sinking, Dying Nations, by their United Councils and Endeavours, and to Regulate all Exorbitances, occasioned by their heady Councils and Miscariages) in not allowing them the Privileges of Porters and Footboyes to enter into their outward Lobby, in taking no notice of them, and putting this fresh affront upon them, after so many former Indignities, in the midst of their and our Domestick Confusions and fears from forein parts, be not an evident Demonstration; that they intend neither the publike Peace, Unity, nor settle­ment of our Government, Laws, Liberties, or Nations, but their unjust support of their own private Interests, Rapines, ambitious Tyrannical Usurpations and Exercises of Supreme Parliamentary Civil and Military Authority over our three Nations to imbroyl them in new Wars and Confusions, to prey upon the small remainder of their Real and Personal Estates, by the power of the Sword, now gotten into their hands, out of the Army-Officers; who abused it likewise to the oppressing and enslaving of the people, and created them a Parliament without the secluded Members, and House of Peers?</p><p>4. Whether their disdainfull, Injurious forcible seclusion of the Members, by their own special Orders and Commands to their Gards and Officers now, be not a shrewd Evidence, that their former seclusions, <span class="hi">Decemb.</span> 6. and 7. 1648. and <span class="hi">May</span> 7. and 9. 1659. (acted by, and fathered on the Army-Offi­cers, and seemingly disowned by themselves) were secretly procured &amp; countenanced by them, thus openly owning their last seclusion, by their precedent Orders and subsequent approbation of it; and that at their very first re-assembling, after their own late forcible seclusion, by <span class="hi">Lamberts</span> and <span class="hi">Hewsons Regi­ments,</span> now Entertained and Imployed in their service, to seclude, and keep out their old honest fellow Members, of Untainted Integrity and merit? Whe­ther it be not a greater breach of Privilege, Trust, Duty, Tyranny, Perjury, and Treason in them, against all former Declarations, the Protestation, So­lemn League and Covenant, taken and Subscribed by them, with hands lifted up to the most High God, thus to seclude their fellow Members: than it was in <span class="hi">Cromwell</span> and <span class="hi">Harrison, April</span> 20. 1653. or for <span class="hi">Lambert October</span> 13. last to seclude and turn themselves out of doors, after their declaring and voting it <span class="hi">Treason, Perjury</span> and <span class="hi">Tyranny</span> in them? Whether this their secluding of the Members by Col. <span class="hi">Okey</span> himself, and others who appeared most active against their Exclusion by <span class="hi">Lambert,</span> will not draw a self-condemnation on them, as acting by their commands, against their Consciences; and justify both <span class="hi">Crom­wels</span> and <span class="hi">Lamberts</span> seclusion of themselves? And justly encourage all their newly reduced Soldiers and others, to shut and turn themselves out of the House again upon any emergent occasion or discontent, with greater boldness and impunity than before, since they justified their last seclusion, by their former <span class="hi">underhand encouragements of them to seclude the Majority of the Members, who over-voted them in</span> Decemb. 1648. and give them Orders to seclude them now again upon the same account in the same month of <span class="hi">December, for fear they should over-vote them if re-admitted?</span></p><p>5. Whether their printed <span class="hi">Vote,</span> Decem. 27. <span class="hi">To take the business of their absent Members into debate on the</span> 5. <span class="hi">of Ianuary next</span>; instead of giving admittance, or any answer to the 22. secluded Members waiting for an answer in the Lobby above 2. hours, be not a meer dilatory <span class="hi">Cheat</span> put upon the <span class="hi">secluded Members,</span> the City of <span class="hi">London,</span> and whole <span class="hi">Nation</span>; to delay their admission till they have put new Gards on, and drawn up all their forces to <span class="hi">London,</span> to over-awe the City, and hinder their long-delayed <span class="hi">Militia</span> for their own security; and setled the Militia of every County under their own commands, to enslave the whole City and Nation to their Tyranny and usurped <span class="hi">Parliamentary</span> Power; and then they will not only forcibly keep out all the Members, but absolute­ly eject them, unlesse they will take their new Oath and Ingagement: As is evident by their <span class="hi">Speakers</span> prohibiting the Lord Maior and Common Coun­cil on Saturday last to set up their Chains and <span class="hi">settle their Militia</span>; and their Order and Vote on <span class="hi">Munday</span> night against all forces raised without their Order, to hinder the <span class="hi">M<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span>litia</span> in the City, when they commanded the Militia in the <span class="hi">Suburbs</span> and <span class="hi">Westminster</span> to meet and Act that day: And by some of their discourses to two seeluded Members; <span class="hi">That there was no hopes of their admission, unlesse they were for a Commonwealth, would take the Ingagement, and confirm what they had done</span>: and thereby become as guilty, treacherous, perfidious, disloyal, and hurtfull to the publike as themselves) which those Members assured them, <span class="hi">they would never submit to,</span> being against the Privilege of Parliament, their Judgements, Consciences, Protestation, Covenant, former Oathes upon their first <span class="hi">admission as Members.</span></p><p>6. Whether the City, or English Nation, can expect the least justice ease or redresse of their insupportable Burdens, Taxes, and Impositions from these new Tax-masters, who (though they are not yet the Tenth part of a full <span class="hi">Commons House</span>) presumed to pass and print a New <span class="hi">Act of Parliament, to continue their</span> expired <span class="hi">Customs and Excises</span> on them, till <span class="hi">March next?</span> Whether their unpresidented presumption, in arrogating to themselves the Title, power and au­thority of a Parliament; when all Laws, and Lawbooks resolve, their own Consciences and the whole Nation infallibly know them to be no Parliament, nor Commons house, hath not brought them within the compasse and penalty of this Clause in their own last Act, before their Dissolution by <span class="hi">Lambert, October</span> 11. intituled, <span class="hi">An Act against raising of Money upon the people without their Consent in Parliament: And be it further enacted, That no person or persons shall after the</span> 11. <span class="hi">of October,</span> 1659. <span class="hi">Assess, levy, collect, gather or receive, any Customs, Imposts, Excise, Assessment, Contribution. Tax, Tallage, or any sum or sums of money, or other Impositions whatsoever, upon the People of this Commonwealth, without their consent in Parliament, or as by Law might have béen done before the Third of November,</span> 1640. <span class="hi">And be it further enacted and declared, That every person offending against this Act,</span> (therefore every of themselves who passed this new Act, Decemb. 27 and those who shall put it in execution) <span class="hi">shall be and are hereby adjudged to be guilty of High Treason, and shall forfeit and suffer as in case of High Treason.</span> Whether the people of this Commonwealth (the thousand part whereof knew not of their new sitting) did ever consent to this sudden extemporary new Act, made the first morning of their sitting in lesse than two hours space, when there were but 42. Members in the House; 22. secluded Members at the door, and near 250. more Members yet living, (besides the whole House of Lords, who must stand for <span class="hi">Cyphers</span>) absent, and not privy to their Session, or this Act? If not, (as is unquestionable) whether by this their own Law and Act, <span class="hi">they be not adjudged to be guilty of High Treason, and to forfeit and suffer as in case of High Treason,</span> for this their imposing and continuing of Customs and Excises on the people; as well as for their <span class="hi">seclusion</span> of their Members; which they voted to be <span class="hi">Treason in Lambert?</span> And whether the Offices and Common Soldiers can upon this account expect any pay from the <span class="hi">City</span> or <span class="hi">Country,</span> or <span class="hi">Indemnity</span> for secluding those Now sitting, if they of­fend again in <span class="hi">secluding the greatest part of the Members,</span> which are in truth the only House, which can only really pay and indemaifie them?</p></div><!--TEI back--><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><div class="footer"><!--standard links to project, institution etc--><a class="plain" href="/">Home</a> </div><address>Prynne, William, 1600-1669..
