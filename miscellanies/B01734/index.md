## 1\. Doubtful ROBIN; Or, Conſtant NANNY. A New BALLAD.

Tune of, Wou'd you be a man of Faſhion, or, Doubting Virgin.

_[figure]_

DEareſt Nanny prithee tell me,

be ſo juſt as tell me true

What hard fate was that befell me

to be ſlighted ſo by you:

I that thought your vows ſo laſting

did imagine no deceit,

But I find all your proteſting

to be nothing but a cheat.

But I find &c.

Tell me then thou faithleſs woman

why thou doſt ſo ill with me,

Thou that did proteſt that no man

ever was ſo dear to thee:

Tho' in vain I ſhould perſwade thee

once thy promiſe to renew,

Yet I pitty to upbraid thee

that thou art ſo much untrue.

Yet &c.

Her Anſwer.

Deareſt Robin pray believe me,

from my heart I freely ſpeak,

I did never yet deceive thee,

nor my vows will never break;

I did alwaies love you dearly,

and no other man but you,

My poor heart does ſhew it clearly,

that I never was untrue.

My poor heart &c.

_[figure]_

_[figure]_

Tell me pray why you are frighted

that I ſhould unconſtant prove,

Or to think that you are ſlighted,

or the leaſt ſuſpect my love;

Tell me pray that I may mend it,

if that any cauſe be due;

I am ſure I can defend it,

for I never was untrue.

I am ſure &c.

Take this kiſs and take my heart too

if that will confirm my dear,

if you think I do not ſmart too,

will you then believe this tear:

Iealouſie indéed may wrong us,

and our ſorrows may renew,

if your fears bring that among us,

'tis in vain for to be true.

If your fears &c,

Yet my deareſt ne'r ſhall find it

that I e're will prove unkind,

For I never yet deſign'd it

ever for to change my mind;

Since you once believ'd I lov'd you,

know I ſtill ſhall do ſo too,

Let no jealous fancy move you

for to think I am untrue.

Let no jealous &c.

Deareſt Nanny i'le believe thee,

And reſerve thee to my heart,

For my jealous thoughts forgive me

and we never more will paſt:

All the day I will embrace thee,

to my fears i'le bid adieu,

VVhen at night I ſhall unlace thee,

thou ſhalt ſay that I am true.

When at night &c.

But I hope that we are friends too,

now thy patience I have try'd:

This i'le do for thy amends too

whenſoe're you are my Bride,

There's my heart & there's my hand too,

to all ſorrows bid adieu,

All I have you ſhall command too,

ſince I find that you are true.

All I have &c.

So they ſeal'd up their indentures

with a loving kiſs or two,

Married ſtraight at all adventures,

never Couple lov'd ſo true;

So I wiſh they may perſevere

in this happy way of life,

Then true cauſe ſhe will have never

to repent ſhe was a wife.

Then true cauſe &c.
