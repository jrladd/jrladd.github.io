For thou ſhalt thinke thou ſeeſt all, and ſeeſt nothing; Feeleſt it ſenceablie with thy fingers, holdeſt it faſt, canſt not looſe it, and yet ſhall open thy hand and finde nothing.</p><p>The paſſages of ſome men, in points of Religion, are carried much after ſuch a ſort: For one would thinke, to heare the ſmooth­nes of their tale, and what integritie and plainnes they doe pro­feſſe; That it is all Goſpell they ſpeake, and that their cauſe, is cleare, and nothing is to be ſaid to the contrarie: Notwithſtanding when another comes forth, and replies againſt them, rips up their tale, weighs their reaſons, diſcloſeth the errour and weaknes of their pleading. Men wonder at their owne ſimplicitie and igno­rance, and that ever they ſhould be ſo fond as to beleeve them. But ſeeing I am now to deale only in the point of <span class="hi">hearing of falſe Miniſters:</span> I will not therefore ſtep out of the beaten way to take in any by-diſcourſe; Only I thinke good to certifie, that I mar­vaile, that ſuch men who walke not as we doe in <span class="hi">Church-way,</span> but thinke us to cenſorious and <span class="hi">over juſt:</span> Why they doe not publickly anſwer our grounds and arguments publiſhed to the world, and ſo prove their <span class="hi">nevv Principles</span> in as faire and open a way; that either <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e389"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=15565&amp;page=4">[Page]</a></span> we may come to them, finding them to walke more agreeable to the Scriptures, or ſhew our reaſons to the contrarie.</p><p>For the matter here in controuerſie: That the <span class="hi">Reader</span> may pro­fit the more by it, there are 5 things, which J deſire him to doe. 1. When thou ſetteſt thy ſelfe to read, ſet thy ſelfe as in Gods preſence, looke on with a ſingle and impartiall eye; weigh the arguments well on both ſides, not by ſhewes and ſhifts, but by the juſt Ballance of the incorruptible and unchangable Word of God; In judging, judge I beſeech thee righteous judgment; and let the truth be deare to thy ſoule; and doe not ſide with any ſide, becauſe thy minde gives thee, it leadeth moſt to eaſe, credit, profit plea­ſure, or ſuch wordly reſpects, but to that which moſt tendeth to the glorie of Gods great name, the purity of religion, and to the moſt comfort and peace of thy own conſcience.</p><p>2. I would have thee to <span class="hi">live by thy owne faith,</span> and not build upon anothers fancie, it is a great fault in ſome, in that they ſee nothing, but by other mens eyes. What this man, or ſuch a man holdeth, that is their beleife; And beſides this, they can give no more reaſon for what they hold, then the Parrat of her ſpeaking. I need not goe farre for proofe; The point in controverſie cleares it ſufficient­ly. For as one<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note9">Galen: Claſ. 2. lib. de cuiuſq: a­nimi pec­cat▪ notitia at que me­dela.</span> well ſaith: <span class="hi">That which a credible perſon telleth, is eaſilie thought credible by ſuch as are well perſwaded of him.</span> What hath drawn many unto this practice of <span class="hi">Hearing unlawfull Mini­ſters?</span> But taking the thing upon truſt, without due triall and exa­mination. Sure I am, had men meaſured it by the <span class="hi">Goulden Read</span> of the Scriptures, they would ſoon have perceived, that it was never ſet apart by Gods appointment, for the <span class="hi">ſpirituall building.</span></p><p>3. <span class="hi">Be not wiſe in thy ovvne eyes.</span> But rather deny thy ſelfe in thy own <span class="hi">judgment, vvill, affection, reaſon,</span> &amp;c. And be contented to bee guided by the alone Word of God. What is the reaſon that ſome men doe ſeeke after the truth, as a coward doth his enemie, loath to find him? But becauſe loving their owne conceit (as <span class="hi">Apes</span> their yong ones) beyond meaſure, they are not willing to heare of any thing that is ſaid againſt it.</p><p>We ſee in nature, he that will heare well, muſt ſtopp his breath; It is ſo in things ſpirituall: if a man will not <span class="hi">keep in his breath,</span> I meane ſet aſide <span class="hi">conceitednes</span> &amp; <span class="hi">ſelfe-love,</span> &amp; be willing to embrace the truth, though it be contrarie to that which he formerly held he ſhall not profit by any thing, he heareth or readeth, but like <span class="hi">Pha­roahs<span class="gap" title="•"> [...]</span> kine</span> remaine lean &amp; ilfavored ſtill.</p><p>Things in the earth will grow as they find roome; A Light in the dampes of mines, goeth out: Thus ſtands the caſe with men, <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e470"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=15565&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> when any good helpe is pur into their hands: If their hearts then, be free of ſelfe-love, ſpirituall pride, perſonall prejudice, baſe deſire of vaine glorie and humaine applauſe, &amp;c. They will profit by it; Contrariwiſe if their hearts, like a <span class="hi">deepe hole,</span> be full of thoſe filthy <span class="hi">Foggs</span> &amp; <span class="hi">Miſts,</span> the truth then (how clearely ſoever it ſhine) will dampe &amp; quench in them, as a light in the mines of the earth.</p><p>4.<span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note10">Civile dig. 4. de legib.

And if it be ſo, that he thinkes, in ſome point I have erred (as who liveth &amp; erreth not) I would not have him, for ſuch a particular fayling to condemne the whole. But let that beare its owne burden, and let the reſt be received, as (after due trial) the ſame ſhalbe found agreeable to the Word of God.</p><p>I ſpeake not this, as beeing privy to any known crime this way; But becauſe I am privy to many known wants &amp; great weakneſſes in my ſelfe. Beſides, it is the manner of ſome, if they can ſpy ſome thing not well handled in another mans writing, to take ſuch ad­vantage, as hereby they ſeeke to bring the whole under reproofe and condemnation. Of this ſhalbe all their talke, at this they will gird and jeſt; not beeing able in the meane time to take away the force of any one of the maine arguments. Neither indeed dare to attempt it, but like the ſnaile keepe in their hornes.</p><p>5. I thinke good to ſpeake here a little concerning the manner of this anſwer. And that no man may be offended as it; I doe pro­feſſe in the Word of truth, that it hath much greeved me all along the diſcourſe, to ſpeake ſo much of the <span class="hi">Treatiſer,</span> whoſe learning I doe much reverence; But the cauſe beeing the Lords, and I ſeeing how much it lay upon me, to take away the <span class="hi">Maſkes</span> and <span class="hi">viſards,</span> whereby many have been deceived, I have done my beſt to ſhew the abſurdities, contradictiōs, unſkilfulnes &amp; daungerouſnes of that <span class="hi">Treatiſe.</span> And for this <span class="hi">not ſparing</span> but ſpeaking home, I have had ſome reaſons for it, as partly here follow.</p><p>1. Becauſe the Booke containes a pernitious &amp; moſt hurtfull er­rour; and by how much it is caried forth, under a colourable ſhew of a <span class="hi">pious and godly practice,</span> by ſo much the more hath it cauſed many greevious &amp; long laſting miſeries. I know there are many viler errours dayly maintained; But if we reſpect mens walking in the <span class="hi">Holie Order of the Goſpell,</span> this is a main ſtumbling block &amp; barre in the way to it: There are ſome humours, which ſome where placed in the body, are quiet and doe little hurt, but in <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d30e544"><a href="http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=15565&amp;page=5">[Page]</a></span> other places, ſpecially in the paſſage, they doe much miſchiefe. This <span class="hi">er­rour,</span> is as a <span class="hi">corrupt humour,</span> fallen into the <span class="hi">paſſage</span> of the bodie, the Church; and therefore it muſt needs be the more perilous.</p><p>2. I have ſpoken the more plainely againſt it, becauſe they ſay, there are manie in England and in other Countries, who hold it unlawfull to be preſent at their <span class="hi">divine ſervice,</span> and to receive the Sacraments in the <span class="hi">Pariſh-Churches;</span> and yet thinke it lawfull to heare the Miniſters of that Church. Now, if ſuch men have (as had <span class="hi">David)</span> tender hearts, and hearts that will ſmite them for a little; They will ſurely come off from this too. Seeing I have here proved, that the ground they build on, is very ſand, and their pleading for it, wants both Religion &amp; reaſon.</p><p>3. Such a general fame is gone forth of the booke, as to be ſo learned­ly &amp; abſolutely done, that it gives all men ſatisfaction (ſome few riged ſpirits only excepted) &amp; that no man would ever be able to make any ſound reply to it. And for my ſelfe, I have been by name chalenged (as it were) to anſwer, with much baſe inſulation, as if I d urſt rather eate my pen, then put my pen to write againſt it. And this both before my thoughts were ſetled on thing, and ſince too. Now, whether the worke be according to the praiſe of it, let all indifferent men judge.</p><p>4. Seeing it is given out (but me thinkes it ſhould not be true) that there are ſome learned men, which plead for the <span class="hi">Hearing of falſe Mi­niſters;</span> and upon the <span class="hi">Treat.</span> grounds; I have therefore diſcovered the ſleightnes of it (to ſay no worſe) the more: That ſuch (if there be any ſuch) may ſee their errour; If not, reply if they pleaſe &amp; when they wil.</p><p>But for the perſon, or perſons that ſhall reply; Theſe 3 things I deſire may be conſidered: 1. That they change not the ſtate of the queſtion; which is not, whether it be lawfull to heare the <span class="hi">Miniſters of the church of England,</span> or of <span class="hi">Rome,</span> or of any Church; But taking it granted, <span class="hi">a Church to be falſe, &amp; the Miniſterie Antichriſtian; vvhether Hearing in ſuch a caſe be lawfull;</span> For the queſtion now ſtands thus, &amp; no otherwiſe.</p><p>2. J exſpect an anſwer, in a more honeſt &amp; fairer way, then I had the laſt time namly, by a <span class="hi">ſort of gnats,</span> <span style="display:block" class="notemarginRight aside" id="Note11">It hath beē objec­ted as I heare, that I ſhould anſwere <span class="hi">dead mē ▪</span> now how ſo ever it is wel known that my former booke was both finiſh ed and at the <span class="hi">Preſſe,</span> before <span class="hi">Dr. Ames</span> death: yet ſay I had writen af­ter his death: doe not all mē know, that in points of differē ­ces, we haue re­ſpect to the matter it ſelf, &amp; no to any per­ſon on ei­ther ſide holding the ſame▪</span> whom I felt but never ſaw: the Law of God and Light of Nature teacheth.</p><div class="q">Quod tibi vis fieri, hoc facias &amp; alteri.</div><p>Indeed it is a very unbeſeeming thing, that men who doe profeſſe Religion &amp; learning, ſhould diſgrace other mens worke, behinde their backs, ſhunning in the meane time the open light, whereby their deeds might be made manifeſt.

The maine drift and ſcope of his reaſon, is not onlie untrue; But indeed very daungerous, to ſay no worſe of it, as rending to reſtraine people from hearing the true Miniſters of Chriſt. And that this is ſo, I prove it thus. That preaching which hath not, or doth not or­dinarily begit men to the Faith of Chriſt, may not lawfully be heard. But the preaching of many true Miniſters in their Congregations neither hath, nor doth ordinarily begit men to the Faith of Chriſt; Ergo, &amp;c.</p><p>If his Argument in the affirmative be true: <span class="hi">Tam forma, quam ma­teria;</span> To ſay nothing of mood and figure. Then in the <span class="hi">negative</span> this is true alſo, according to that knowne rule, <span class="hi">parium par eſt ratio:</span> There is alike reaſon of things alike.

I ſay ſuch Miniſters are to be rejected, be they in their places never ſo pain­full and conſcionable.</p><p>This being ſo, marke the inference: <span class="hi">Noah</span> preached a 120 yeares, and yet there followed no ordinarie converſion in the old World.
