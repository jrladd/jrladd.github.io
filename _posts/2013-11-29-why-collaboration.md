Two of the three final papers I'm writing this semester have to do with expanding the traditional definition of collaboration. We usually think of two or more people working together, in relative harmony, to produce something. But what if the product a group of people make isn't one thing; what if they're influenced by each other and each produce something separate but complementary? Can rivals be collaborators? Can readers collaborate with authors? Do collaborators have to know each other, or even ever speak in person, in order to collaborate?

Some of this has to do with what [Foucault][fou], [Barthes][bart], and others have been saying about authorship for decades. If the author isn't a monolithic figure, then collaboration is the name of the game. (This is a gross oversimplification, but the links lead to more complex ideas.) I also draw from current thinking about networks from [Latour][la] and others. Collaboration, as a phenomenon, is distributed, and the models we use to think about it should be distributed. I'm also influenced by existing web technologies that might allow us to see a new side of collaboration. Things like [Git][], [Twitter][], or even [Google Docs][docs] can get us to think about working together in a distributed way. (I have some reservations about what web technologies can teach us, and whether what they're doing is really "new". But more on that in a later post.)

There are two big questions I've been asked about expanding collaboration. What is there to gain from calling other things (like rivalry), that we already have names for, collaboration? And how does this model not expand endlessly until anyone can be said to collaborate with anyone else at any time?

In part this blog is meant to be a sandbox for me to figure these kinds of things out, but here are some preliminary ideas:

To the first question, in a profession like English literature that is fixated on subjects (the single author) and products (the monograph) that maintain the illusion of a single figure working alone, it has become important to restate the idea that all work has some collaborative element. The notion of authors working collaboratively can create more historical accuracy around figures who have traditionally been studied in a vacuum, such as [Milton][miltron], to cite my favorite example. Collaboration can also help us rethink the ways we conduct our research in the humanities. There have been great strides made in this area, particularly in the digital humanities, but there is still room for improvement.

To the second question, like Latour I believe that a collaborative network can be traced or decoded. With the right mindset, it's possible to understand how collaboration might work in different circumstances, and which collaborators, or actors in Latourian terms, it might include. Not all collaborators will come into play in all networks, but most networks will include more collaborators than one might initially expect.
