title: " Two Sentences"
---

For one of the three courses I'm currently finishing, the instructor has asked that we send in a summary of our final papers in two sentences. I'm a big fan of these kinds of micro writing assignments, having devised a few for my own students in the past. You can learn a lot from being forced to be concise. 

I think it's a particularly good exercise for grad students, for whom the "elevator pitch" of a project or essay can be an important element of winning over advisers, colleagues, and even interviewers. I know that I personally can always use the chance to practice explaining my work in a concise, accessible way. In this spirit, I've rendered all three of my final projects into two-sentence summaries, below.

* In _What Is Philosophy?_, Deleuze and Guattari offer a method of collaboration through conceptual personae that is not limited by traditional ideas about two individuals working together. I will examine four different relationships that explore conceptual personae in different ways leading to a relationship among two people who are not explicitly linked: Deleuze's Guattari, Deleuze's Spinoza, Stengers' Latour, and finally Latour's Deleuze.

* John Dryden and John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester had a fraught relationship, starting out as client and patron and ending up as bitter rivals. By tracing their correspondencee in different registers, poetry, drama, prefaces, and letters, I will show that their manner of exchange is still collaborative regardless of whether or not they were friends or enemies at a particular moment in time.

* Many computational approaches to literary texts employ methods well-suited to texts with high wordcounts (such as novels) at the expense of texts with relatively low wordcounts (such as lyric poems). By developing a python program that analyzes Shakespeare's sonnets by their rhythm, I hope to create a computational approach to lyric poetry that is useful for a study of poetic genre.
