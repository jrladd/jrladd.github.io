  <h1>About J.R. Ladd</h1>
  <p>
    I'm John, and I'm studying English literature in the PhD program at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm interested mainly in 17th century poetry and drama, especially print and manuscript anthologies and miscellanies. My other interests include the history of the book, network theory, and digital humanities.

    I live in St. Louis with my partner, Katie, and our cat, Cardigan. Despite the considerable demands that grad school puts on time, we manage to spend our free time cooking, biking, and consuming unhealthy amounts of pop culture.
