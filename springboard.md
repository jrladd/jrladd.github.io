## Things, Notions, and Words #1

For the first edition, the source of this board's title and an (unintentional?) reflection on Spring '83.

>But the business of *Defining*, being amongst all others the most nice and difficult, must needs render it a very hard task for any one to attempt the doing of this, for all kinde of *Things*, *Notions*, and *Words*, which yet is necessary to the design here proposed.

> I am very sensible that the most usefull inventions do at their first appearance, make but a very slow progress in the World, unless helped forward by some particular advantage.

&#9997; John Wilkins, [*An Essay Towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language*](https://texts.earlyprint.org/works/A66045.xml?page=003-b), 1668.
