# Loue and Liue. TO ALL THE NOBIlitie, and all other in office, God graunte wiſedome and all thinges nedefull for the preſeruation of their Eſtates. Amen.

PLato among many of his notable ſentences concernyng the gouernement of a common weale hath this: well is that Realme gouerned, in which the ambicious, deſire not to beare office. Whereby you may perceiue (right honourable) what offices are, where they be duely executed: not gainfull ſpoyles for the gredy to hunt for, but painefull toyles for the heady to bee charged with. You may perceiue alſo by this ſentence, there is nothing more neceſſary in a common weale, then that Magiſtrates be diligent and truſty in their charges.

¶And ſure in whatſoeuer Realme ſuch prouiſion is made, ye officers be forced to do their duties: there is it as hard a matter to get an officer, as it is in other places to repulſe & ſhift of thoſe that with flattery, brybes, and other ſhiftes, ſue & preace for offices. For the ambitious (that is to ſaye prollers for power or gayne) ſeeke not for offices to helpe other, for whych cauſe officers are ordained: but with the vndoing of other, to enrich themſelues. And therfore ar them once of this bayt, & force them to do their dueties, then will they geue more to be rid from their charges, than they did at yt firſt to come by eē: For they ſeeke onely their priuate profite. And therfore, where  the ambitious ſeeke no office: there no doubt, offices are duely miniſtred. And whee offices are duely miniſtred, it cannot be choſen, but the people are good, whereof muſt nedes follow a good common weale. For if the magiſtrates be good, the people cannot be ill. Thus the goodnes or badnes of any Realme lieth in the goodnes or badnes of the Rulers. And therfore not without great cauſe do the holy Appoſtles ſo earneſtly charg vs to pray for the magiſtraes: For in dede the wealth & quiet of euery common weale, the diſorder alſo and miſeries of the ſame, come ſpecially thorough them. I neede not go eyther to the Romaines or Greekes for the profe hereof, neither yet to ye Iewes, or other nations: whoſe common weales haue alway floriſhed whyle their magiſtrates were good, and decayed and ra to ruyne, when vicius men had the gouernement.

Out countrey ſtories (if we reade and marke them) wil ſhow vs examples enow, would God we had not ſene mo thā enow. I purpoſe not to ſtand herevpon the particulars, becauſe they be in parte ſetforth in the tragedies folowing. Yet by ye waye this I note (wiſhing all other to doe the like) namely, that as good gouernours haue neuer lacked their deſerued praiſes: ſo haue not the bad eſcaped infamy, beſides ſuch plagues as are horrible to heare of. For God (ye ordeiner of offices) although he ſuffer them for puniſhment of the people to be often occupied of ſuch, as are rather ſpoilers and Iudaſſes, than toilers or Iuſtices (whom the ſcriptures cal Hypocrits) yet ſuffereth he them not to ſcape vnpuniſhed, becauſe they diſhonour him. For it is Gods own office, yea his chief office which they beare and abuſe. For as Iuſtice is the chief vertue, ſo is ye miniſtration thereof, the chiefeſt office: and therfore hath God eſtabliſhed it with the chiefeſt name, honouring and calling Kinges and all officers vnder them by his owne name: Gods. Ye be al Gods, as many as haue in your charge any miniſtration of iuſtice. What a foule ſhame were it for any nowe to take vpon them the name and office of God, and in their doings to ſhew  themſelues deuils? God cannot of Iuſtice, but plague ſuche ſhameleſſe preſumption and hipocriſie, and that with ſhamful death, diſeaſes, or infamye. Howe he hath plagued euil rulers from time to time, in other nations, you may ſee gathred in Bochas boke intituled The fall of Princes, trāſlated into Engliſh by Lydgate a Monke of y• Abbey of Bury in Suff. How he hath delt with ſome of our countrymen your aunceſtours, for ſundry vices not yet left, this boke named, A Mirrour for Magiſtrates, ſhall in parte plainye ſet forth before your eyes which boke I humbly offer vnto your honours, beſeching you to accept it fauorably. For here, as in a mirror or lokīg glaſſe you ſhal ſe if any vice be foūd, how the like hath ben puniſhed in other heretofore, wherby admoniſhed, I truſt it will bee a good occaſiō to moue mē to ye ſoner amēdmēt. This is ye chief end why this booke is ſetforth, which God graūt it may talke according to the maner of the makers. The worke was beg ̄ & part of it printed in quene Maries time, but ſtaid by ſuch as thē were chief in office, neuertheles, through ye meanes of the right honorable Hēry Lord Stafford, ye firſt part was licēced, & imprinted ye firſt yeare of ye raign of this our moſt noble and vertuous Quene, & dedicated to your honours with this preface, Since wt time, although I wāted ſuch help as before, yet the ſaid good Lord Stafford hath not ceaſed to cal vpō me, to publiſh ſo much therof as I had gottē at other mēs hands, ſo yt through his Lordſhips earneſt meanes, I haue now alſo ſetforth another part, conteining as much as I could obtaine at ye hands of my frends: Which in ye name of al the authours, I hūbly dedicate vnto your honours, inſtātly wiſhing, yt it may ſo like & dete your minds, y• your chereful receiuīg thereof▪ may encourage worthy wis to enterpriſe & performe ye teſt. Which aſſone as I may procure. I entēd through Gods leaue & your fauorable allowance, to publiſh with all expedicion.

In the meane whyle my Lordes and Gods, (for ſo It may cal you) I moſte humbly beſech your honours fauorably to accept  this rude worke, and diligentlye to reade and conſider it. And although you ſhal find in it, that ſome haue for their vertue bin enuied and brought vnto miſery: yet ceaſe not you to be vertuous, but do your office to the vttermoſt. Embrace vertue and ſuppreſſe the contrary, both in your ſelues and other, ſo ſhall God whoſe officers you are, eyther ſo maintaine you that no malice ſhall preuaile, or if it do, it ſhall be for your good, & to your eternall glory both here and in heauen which I beſeech God you may both ſeeke and attaine, Amen.
Yours moſt humble VV. B.

# ❧A BRIEFE MEMOriall of ſundry vnfortunate Engliſhmen. VVILLIAM BALDVVIN to the Reader

WHEN the Printer had purpoſed with himſelf to Print Lidgates tranſlation of Bochas, of the fal of Princes, hauinge made priuy thereto, many both honourable and Worſhippefull: hee was coūſayled by dyuers of them to procure a continuance of the Storye from whereas Bochas left, vnto this preſēt time, chiefly of ſuch as Fortune had abuſed here in this Iſland: which might bee as a Myrrour for men of all eſtates and degrees aſwell Nobles as other, to behold the ſlippery deceiptes of the wauering Lady, & the due reward of all kinde of vices. Which aduice liked him ſo well, that he required mee to take paynes therein: but becauſe it was a matter paſſing my wit & ſkill, and more thanckleſſe than gaynefull to enterpriſe. I refuſed vtterly alone to vndertake it without the helpe of ſutch, as in wit were apt, in learninge allowed, and in iudgemente and eſtimation able to wield and diſcharge the weight of ſutch a burden, thinkinge ſo to ſhift my handes. But hee earneſt and diligent in hys affayres, procure me an Athlas  to laye the burden vppon my ſhoulders, which I would not haue undertaken, but that ſhortly after diuers learned men (whoſe many giftes nede few prayſes) conſented to take vpon them part of the trauaile. And when certayne of them to the numof ſeuen, were through a generall aſſent at an appoyncted time and place, gathered together to deuiſe thereuppon: I reſorted vnto them, bringinge with mee the booke of Bochas tranſlated by Dan Lidgate, for the better obſeruation of his order: which although wee did not miſlyke, yet would it not conueniently ſerue, ſeing that both Bochas, & Lidgate were dead, neither were there any alyue that had medled wt like argumēt, to whom the vnfortunate might make their moane. To make therfore a ſtate meete for the matter, they al agreed that I ſhoulde vſurpe Bochas rome, and the wretched Princes complaine vnto me: and toke vpon themſelues, euery man for his part to be ſundry perſonages, and in their behalfes to bewaile vnto me their ſundry chaunces, heauy deſtenies, and wofull miſfortunes. This done, wee opened ſutch Bookes of Chronicles as wee had there preſent, and Maiſter Ferrers after hee had founde where Bochas left, which was about the ende of Kinge Edward the thirdes raigne, to begin the matter, ſayd thus.

I maruayle (ꝙ hee) what Bochas meaneth to forget among his myſerable Princes, ſuch as were of our Nation, whoſe number is as great as theyr  Aduentures wonderfull. For to let paſſe all, both Britaynes, Danes, and Saxons, and to come to the laſt Conqueſt, what a ſort are they, and ſome alſo in the time of Bochas himſelfe, or not much before. As for example William Rufus the ſecond kinge of Englande after the Cōqueſt, eyther by malice or miſaduenture ſlayne hunting in the new foreſt, by Walter Tirrell with ye ſhot of an arrow. Robert Duke of Normandy eldeſt ſonne to William Conquerour depriued of his inheritaunce of England, by Henry his youngeſt brother hauing both his eyes put out, and after, myſerably impriſoned in Cardiffe Caſtel, whereas hee died. The moſt Lamentable caſe of William, Rychard, and Mary, children of the ſayde Henry the firſt called Beauclerke, drowned vpon y• Sea by the negligence of drunken Mariners, and Kynge Rychard the fyrſt ſlaine with a quarel in his chiefe proſperity. The moſt vnnaturall murther of Artur Duke of Britayne right Heyre of Englande, by king Ihon his vncle, wt the death of Iſabell his Siſter by Famyne. The myſerable ende of the ſayd king Ihon their vncle by Surfet, or as ſome write poyſoned by a Monke of the Abbey of Swinſted in Lyncolneſhrye. Are not their Hiſtories ruful, and of rare Example? But as it ſhould appeare, Bochas being an Italian, minded moſt the Romayne, and Italike Story, or els perhaps hee wanted the knowledge of ours. It were therefore a goodly and notable  matter, to ſearch and diſcourſe our whole ſtory from the firſt beginninge of the inhabiting of the Iſle. But ſeeinge the Printers mynde is to haue vs ſupply where Lidgate left, we wil leaue that great labour to other yt may intende it, and (as one being bold fyrſt to breake the Iſe) I will begin at y• reigne of Rychard ye ſecōd, a time as troubleſome to ye people, as vnlucky to y• Prince. And for aſmutch frende Baldwin, as it ſhall be your charge to penne orderly the whole proceſſe: I will ſo far as my memory, and iudgement ſerueth, ſomewhat further you in the truth of the ſtory. And therefore omittinge the ruffle made by Iacke Straw & his Lewd meiney, with the murder of many notable mē which thereby happened, (for Iacke as yee knowe was but a poore Prince) I wil begin with a notable example, which within a while after enſued. And although the perſon (at whom I beginne) was no kinge nor Prince: yet ſithens he had a Princely office, I wil take vpon mee the miſerable perſon of Syr Robert Treſilian chiefe Iuſtice of Englande, and of other his fellowes learned in ye Law yt were plagued wt him: thereby to warne all of theyr callinge & profeſſion, to be ware of wronge Iudgementes, miſcō ſtruinge of Lawes, or wreſtinge the ſame to ſerue the Prynces turne, which rightfully brought them to a myſerable ende, which they may iuſtly lament in maner enſuinge. *⁎*

# ❧THE FALL OF SIR Robert Treſilian chief Iuſtice of England, and other his fellowes, for miſconſtruinge the Lawes and expoundinge them to ſerue the Prynces affections. Anno. 1388.
IN the rufull Regeſter of miſchifee, and miſhap,Baldwin we beſech thee with our names to begin,Whom vnfrendly Fortune did trayne vnto a trap,Whē we our ſtate eſtéem'd moſt ſtable to haue bin:So lightly léeſe they all, which all do weene to winne:Learne by vs yee Lawyers, and Iudges of the Lande,Vpright and vncorrupt in dome alway to ſtand.And print yee this preſident to remayne for euer,Enroll and recorde it in tables made of Braſſe,Engraue it in Marble that may bee razed neuer,Where Iudges of the Lawe may ſée as in a Glaſſe,What guerdon is for guile, and what our wages was,Who for filthy lucre, corrupt with meede and awe,Wittingly and wretchedly did wreſt the ſence of Lawe.A chaunge more new or ſtraunge, when was there euer ſéene,Then Iudges from the Bench to come downe to the Barre,And counſaylours that were, moſt nigh to King and QuéeneExiled their countrey, from Court and counſayle farre,But ſuch is Fortunes play that can both make and marre,Exaltinge to moſt highe, that was before moſt lowe,And turning tayle agayne, the lofty downe to throwe.And ſuch as late afore, could ſtoutly ſpeake and pleadeBoth in Court, and Countrey, careleſſe of the triall,Stand muet as Mammers without aduice, or readeAll to ſeeke of ſhiftinge, by trauerſe or deniallWhich haue ſeene the day, when for a golden RiallBy fineſſe and cunning, could haue made blacke ſeeme whitAnd moſt extorted wronge, to haue appeared righte.Whilſt thus on bench aboue, wee had the higheſt place,Our reaſons were to ſtrong, for any to confute,But when at barre beneath, we came to pleade our caſeOur wittes were in the wane, our pleadinge very brute,Hard it is for Priſoners, with Iudges to diſputeWhen many againſt one, and none for one ſhall ſpeake.Who weenes himſelfe moſt wyſe, ſhall haply be to weake.To you therefore that ſit, theſe fewe wordes will I ſay,That no man ſits ſo ſure, but may be brought to ſtand,Wherefore whilſt you haue place, & beare the ſwing, & ſwayBy fauour without rygor, let poincts of Law bee ſkand:Pitty the poore Pryſoner that holdeth vp his hand,Ne lade him not with Law, who leaſt of Law hath knowne,Remember ere yee dye, the caſe may bee your owne.Beholde mee vnfortunate Foreman of thys Flocke,Treſilian, ſometime chiefe Iuſtice of this Lande.A Gentleman by byrth, no ſtayne was in my Stocke,Locketon, Hlt, and Belknay, with other of my bande,Which the Lawe and Iuſtice had wholly in our hande,Vnder the ſecond Rychard a Prince of great eſtatesTo whom and vs alſo, blinde Fortune gaue the mate.In the common Lawes oure ſkill was ſo profounde,Oure credit and aucthority ſuch, and ſo eſtéemed,That what that we concluded was taken for a grounde,Allowed was for Lawe, what ſo to vs beſt ſeemed.Lyfe, Death, Landes, goods, and all by vs was deemed.Whereby with eaſy payne, great gaine we did in fet,And euery thinge was fiſhe, that came vnto our net.At Seſſions and Siſes, we bare the ſtroke and ſway,In pantents and commiſſion, of Quorum alway chiefe:So that to whether ſide, ſoeuer we did way,Were it by right or wronge, it paſt without repreſe,The true man we let hang, ſomwhiles to ſaue a Thiefe,Of Golde and of Siluer, our handes were neuer empty,Offices, Frmes, and Fees, fell to vs in great plenty.But what thinge may ſuffice vnto the greedy man?The more he hath in hold, the more he doth deſire,Happy and twyce happy is hee, that wiſely canContent himſelfe with that, which reaſon doth require,And moyleth for no more, then for his needefull hyre:But greedineſſe of minde doth ſeeldome keepe the ſyſe,To whom enough and more, at no time doth ſuffiſe.For like as Dropſy pacients drinke and ſtill be drye,Whoſe vnſtaunched Thirſt no Liquor can Alaye,And drincke they nere ſo mutch, yet Thirſt they by and by,So Catchers, and Snatchers toyle both night and day,Not néedy but gréedy, ſtill prollinge for their Praye,O endeleſſe Thirſt of Gold▪ corrupter of all Lawes,What miſchiefe is on mould whereof thou art not cauſe.Thou madeſt vs forget the fayth we did profeſſe,When Sergeants we were ſworne to ſerue the cōmon Law,Makyng a ſolempne oth in no paynt to dygreſſe.From approued Principles in ſentence nor in ſawe:But we vnhappy wyghts without al dread and awe,Of the Iudge eternall, more high to be promoted.To Mammon more then God, all wholly were deuoted.The Lawes we did interprete and ſtatutes of the Land,Not truely by the Text, but newly by a gloaſe:And wordes y• were moſt plaine, when they by vs were ſcand,Wee turned by conſtruction like a Welſhmans hoaſe,Whereby many a one both life and Land did looſe:Yet this we made our meane to mount a loft on Mules,And ſeruing times and turues, peruerted Lawes and rules.Thus clyming and contending alway to the toppe.From hie, vato higher, and than to be moſt hye,The honny dew of Fortune ſo faſt on vs did droppe,That of King Richards counſayle we came to be moſt nye:Whoſe fauoure to attayne, we were full fine and ſlyeAlway to his auayle, where any ſenſe might ſound,That way (were it all wrong) he Lawes we did expound.So workinge Lawe like waxe, the ſubiect was not ſureOf Life, Land, nor goods, but at the Princes will,Which cauſed his kingdome the ſhorter time to dure,For clayminge power abſolute both to ſaue and ſpill,The Prince thereby preſumed his people for to pill:And ſet his luſtes for Lawe, and will had reaſons place,No more but hange and draw, there was no better grace.The King thus outleaping, the limits of his lawe,Not raygning but raginge, as wyll did him entice,Wyſe and worthy perſons from Court did daylye drawe,Sage counſell ſee at naught, proud vaunters were in price,And royſters bare the rule, which waſted al in vyce,Of ryot and exceſſe, grew ſcarcitie and lacke,Of acking came taxing, and ſo went wealth to wracke.The Barons of the Land, not bearing this abuſe,Conſpiring with the commons aſſembled by aſſent,And ſeing no reaſon nor treaye could induceThe king in any thing his rigour to relent,Maugre his princely mynde: they cald a ParliamentFrancke and free for all men, vnchecked to debateAſwell for weale publique, as for the Princes ſtate.In which high aſſemblye, great thinges were proponed.Touching the Princes ſtate, his regally and crowne,By reaſon that Richard, which much was to be moned,Without regard at all, of honour or renowne,Miſled by ill aduiſe, had turnde al vpſide downe:For ſureie of whoſe ſtate, them thought it did behooue.His counſailours corrupt, by order to remoue.Among whom, Robert Veer, called Duke of Ireland,With Mighel Delapoole, of Suffolke new made Earle.Tharchbyſhop of Yorke was alſo of our hand:With Brembre of London a ful vncurteous churle)Some learned in the law in exile they did hurle:But I iudge Treſilian, becauſe I was the chiefe,Was damned to the Gallowes to dye there as a thiefe.Lo the fyne of falſhoode, the ſtipend of corruption,The ickle fe of fraud, the fruites it doth procure,Ye iudges now liuing, let out iuſt punitionTeach you to ſhake of brybes, and kepe your hndes al pure,Riches and promocion be vayne thinges, and vnſure:The fauour of a Prince is an vntruſtie ſtaye,But Iuſtice hath a fee, that ſhal remayne alwaye.What gloryis more greater in ſight of God or man.Then by pathes of Iuſtice in Iudgement to procede?So duelye and truely the lawes alway to ſkan,That Iuſtice may take place without reward or meede,Set apart all flattery and vayne worldly dreede:Set God before your eyes the righteous Iudge ſupreme,Remember wel your reckening at the day extreame.Abandon all affray, be ſoothfaſt in your ſawes,Be conſtant and careleſſe of mortall mens diſpleaſure.With eyes ſhut, & hands cloſde, you ſhould pronoūce ye lawesWay not this worldly mucke, thincke there is a treaſureMore worth then Gold or ſtone, a thouſand times in valure,Repoſed for all ſuch as righteouſnes enſue,Wherof you cannot fayle, the promiſe made is true.If Iudges in our dayes would ponder wel in mynde,The fatall fall of vs, for wreſting lawe and right,Such ſtatutes as touch lyfe, ſhould not be thus defindeBy ſences conſtrained, againſt true meaning quite,Aſwel they might affirme the blacke for to be whyte.Wherfore we wiſh they would, our act and end compare,And waying wel the caſe, they wyl (we truſt) beware.Finis.G.

WHen finiſhed was this Tragedy, which ſemed not vnfyt for the perſons touched in y• ſame. Another which in the meane tyme had ſtayde vppon ſyr Roger Mortimer Earle of March, and heyre apparaunt of Englande, whoſe miſerable end (as it ſhould appeare) was ſomwhat before the others: ſayd as foloweth. Although it be not greatlye appertinent to our purpoſed matter, yet in my iudgement, I thincke it would do wel to obſerue the tymes of theſe great infortunes, and as they be more auncient in tyme, ſo to place their ſeuerall plaintes: For I fynde that before theſe (of whō maiſter Ferrers here hath ſpoken) there were two earles of ye name of Mortimer, the one in the tyme of king Edward the third out of our date: another in Richard the ſecondes time, ſlayne in Ireland, a yeare before the fal of theſe Iuſtices: whoſe hyſtorie ſyth it is notable, and thexample fruitful, it were not good to ouerpaſſe. And therfore by your lycence and fauours, I wyl take vpon me the perſonage of the earle Mortimer called Roger, who full of bloudye woundes mangled, with a pale countenaunce, and grieſlye looke, may make his moane to Baldwin, in this wiſe.

AMong the ryders on the rolling wheele,Which loſt their holdes, Baldwyn forget not meeWhoſe fatall thred, vntimelye death dyd reeleEre it were twiſted, by the Siſters threee,All folke be rayle, theyr bliſſes brittle bee:For proofe whereof, although none other were,Suffice may I, Sir Roger Mortimer.Not he that was in Edwardes dayes the third,Whom Fortune brought from boote to extreme bale,With loue of whom, the Queene ſo much was ſtird,As for his ſake from honour ſhe did ſcale,And whileſt Fortune, blew on this pleaſaunt gale,Heauing him high on her triumphall Arch,By meane of her hee was made Earle of March.Whence pryde out ſprang, as doth appeare by manye,Whom ſoden hap, aduaunceth in exceſſe,Among thouſandes, ſcarſe ſhal you fynde anye,Which in high wealth that humor can ſuppreſſe,As in this earle, playne proofe did wel expreſſe:For whereas hee too loftye was before,His new degree hath made him now much more.For now alone he ruleth as him luſt,Reſpecting none ſaue only the Queene mother,Which moued malice to foulder out the ruſt,Which deepe in hate, before did lye and ſmother.The Peeres, the People, aſwel the one as other.Againſt him made ſo haynous a complaint,That for a traytour, they did the Earle attaynt.Than al ſuch crimes as hidden lay before,They ſkower a freſh, and ſomwhat to them adde,For hydden hate hath eloquence in ſtore,Whan Fortune biddes ſmall faultes to make more bad,Fyue haynous crymes againſt him ſoone were had,Cauſing the king to yeld vnto the Scot,Townes that this father, but late afore had got.And therewithall the Charter called Ragman,Yeuen to the Scots for brybes and priuie gayne,That by his meanes ſir Edward of CarnaruanIn Berckley Caſtel, moſt cruelly was ſlayne:That with his princes mother he had layne,And laſt of all by pyllage at his

ſecond was by name,Hauing none heire after him to reigne:Made me his mate in earneſt and in game:The Lordes themſelues ſo wel allowd the ſame,That through my titles ulye comming downe,I was made heire apparaunt to the crowne.Who then but I was euery where eſteemed?Wel was the man that vnderſtoode my ert,Whom I allowed, as Lordes the People deemed,And me to ſerue was euery mannes entent,With all that wyt or cunning could inuent:To me as prince attended great and ſmall,In hope a day would come to pay for all.But ſeeldome ioye continueth trouble voyde,In greateſt charge cares greateſt do enſue,The moſt poſſeſt, are euer moſt anoyed,In largeſt ſeas ſor tempeſtes lightly brue,The freſheſt colours, ſooneſt chaunge their hue,In thickeſt place is made the diepeſt wounde,True proofe whereof, my ſelfe to ſoone haue found,For whiles Fortune ſo luld me in her lap,And gaue me giftes more than I did require,The double Dame behynde me ſet a trap,To daſh me downe and laye all in the myre:The Iriſh Kernes agaynſt mee did conſpyre,My Landes of Vlſter vniuſtly to bereaue,Which my mother for heritage did me leaue.And whyles I there to ſet all thinges in ſtaye,(Omit my toyles and troubles thytherwarde)Among mine owne, with my retinue laye,The wylder ſort, whom I did leaſt regard,And therfore the rechleſſe mannes reward:When leaſt I thought, ſet on me in ſuch number,That fro my corps, the lyfe they ſet aſunder.Nought might auayle my courage nor my force,Nor helpe of frendes. which were alas to few:The cruel folke aſſaulted ſo my horſe,That all my helpes in pieces they to hew,Our bloud diſtaind the ground as drops of dewe.Nought might preuayle to flye or yet to yelde,For whom they take they murther in che fielde.No law of Armes they know, nor none wil learne:They make not warre (as other do) a play,The Lord, the Boy, the Gallowglaſſe, the Kerne,Yeeld or not yelde, whom ſo they take they ſlaye,They ſaue no priſoners, for raunſome, nor for paye:Their booty chiefe, they coumpt a deadmans headeTheir end of warre's to ſee their enemie dead.Amongeſt theſe men, or rather ſauage beaſtsI loſt my lyfe, by cruel murther ſlayne,And therfore Baldwin note thou well my geſtes,And warne all princes raſhnes to refrayne,Bid them beware their enemies when they fayne,Nor yet preſume to make their match amiſſe,Had I not ſo done, I had not come to this,At naught I ſet a ſort of naked men,And much the leſſe, ſeeming to flye away,One man me thought was good ynough for ten,Making ſmall account of number more or leſſe,Madneſſe it is, in warre to goo by geſſe,At vnwares aſſaulted by our fone,Which were in number fourtie to vs one.See here the ſlay of pompe and highe eſtate,The feeble hold of this vncerteyn lyfe,For I but young, proclaymed Prince but late,Hauing fayre fruict by my belooued wyfe:Loſt all at once by ſtroake of bloudy knife:Whereby aſſurde, let men themſelues aſſure,That wealth, and lyfe are doubtful to endure.FINIS.T.

AFter this Tragedye ended, Mayſer Ferrers ſayde, ſeeinge it is beſte to place eche perſon in his order, Baldwin take you the Chronicles & marke them as they come: for there are many worthye to bee noted, thoughe not treated of. Firſt the Lorde Murrey a Scottiſh man, who tooke his deathes wound through a ſtroake lent him by the Earle of Notingham, whom he chalenged at the Tylt: But to omit him and alſo the fatte Pryor of Typtre, preſſed to death  with thronge of People vppon London Bridge at the Queenes entrye, I wyll come to the Duke of Gloceſter the kinges vncle, a man mynding the common wealth, and yet at length miſerably made away, in whoſe perſon if ye wil geeue eare, ye ſhal heare what I thinke meete to be ſayd.

# HOVVE SIR THOMAS of VVoodſtocke, Duke of Gloceſtre, Vncle to King Rychard the ſecond, was vnlawfully murdered. Anno. 1397.
WHo ſtabliſht is in State, ſeeming moſt ſure,And ſo far from daunger of Fortunnes blaſt,As by the compaſ o mannes coniecture,No braſen pylter may be fyxt more faſt:Yet wanting the ſtay of prudent forecaſt,Whan froward Fortune liſt for to frowne,May in a moment turne vpſide downe.In proofe whereof, O Baldwin, take payne,Turne thine care to Thomas of Woodſtocke,Preſt in preſence on Fortune to complaine,In the forlorne hope of Engliſh flocke:Who by diſcent was of the royall ſtocke,Sonne to king Edward, third of that name,And ſecond to none in glorye and fame.This noble father to maynteyn my ſtate,With Buckingham Earledome did me idowe:Both Nature and Fortune to me were grate,Denying mee nothing which they might allow:Their ſundrye graces in me did ſo flowe,As beautye, ſtrength, high fauour, and fame,Who may of God more wiſh then the ſame?Brothers we were to the number of ſeuen,I beeing the ſixt, and youngeſt but one:A more royall race was not vnder heauen,More ſtot or more ſtately, of ſtomacke & perſon,Princes al peereleſſe in ech condition,Namelye ſyr Edward, called the blacke Prince,When had England the like before or euer ſince?But what of all this, any man to aſſure,In ſtate vncarefull of Fortunes variaunce?Syth daylye and hourelye wee ſee it in vre,That where moſt cauſe is of affiaunce,Euen there is found moſt weake aſſuraunce:Let none truſt Fortune, but folow reaſon,For often wee ſee in truſt is treaſon.This prouerbe in proofe ouer true I tryed,Fynding high treaſon in place of high truſt,And moſt falſe fayth where I moſt affyed:Beinge by them that ſhould haue bene iuſt.Trayterouſlye entrapt, ere I could miſtruſt,Ah wretched world, what is it to truſt thee?Let them that wil learne now harken to mee.After king Edward the thirdes deceaſe,Succeeded my Nephewe Richard to raigne,Who for his glory and honours encreaſe,Wich princely wages did me entertaine,Againſt the Frenchmen to be his Chieftayne:So paſſing the Seas with royall puiſſaunce,With God and S. George I inuaded Fraunce.Waſtinge the country with ſword and with fyre,Ouer turning townes, high Caſtles and towers,Like Mars God of warre, enflamed with ire,I forced the Frenchmen t'abandon their bowers?Where euer we matcht, I wan at all howers,In ſuch wiſe viſiting both Cittie ad village,That alway my ſouldiers were laden with pyllage.With honour and tryumph was my returne,Was none more ioyous than young king RichardWho minding more highlye my ſtate to adourne,With Gloceſtre Dukedome did me reward:And after in mariage I was prefarde,To a daughter of Bohun an Earle honourable:By whom I was of England high Conſtable.Thus hoyſted high on Fortunes whyrling wheele,As one on a ſtage attending a playe,Seeth not on which ſyde the ſcaffold doth reele,Til timber and poales and al flye awaye.So fared it by me. for day by daye,As honour encreaſed I looked ſtil higher,Not ſeing the daunger of my fond deſier.For Fortunes floud thus running with ful ſtreame,And I a Duke deſcended of great kinges,Conſtable of England, chiefe officer in the realme,Abuſed with aſſuraunce in theſe vayne thinges,I went without feete, and flew without winges:Preſuming ſo faire vpon my high eſtate,That dread ſet apart my Prince I would mate.For whereas all kinges haue counſel of their choyſe,To whom they referre the rule of their Land,With certein familiers in whom to reioyce,For pleaſure or profite, as the caſe ſhall ſtand,I not hearing this, would needes take in hand,Maugre his will, thoſe perſons to diſgrace,And ſuch as I thought tie to ſettle in their place.But as an old Booke ſayth, who ſo wil aſſay,About the Cats necke to hang on any Bell,Had firſt neede to cut the Cats clawes awayeLeaſt if the Cat be curſt, and not camed well,She happly with her nayles may clawe him to the fell,So putting on the Bel about the Cats necke,By being too buſie I caught a cruel checke.Reade wel the ſentence of the Rat of renowne,Which Pierce the Plowman deſcribes in his Dreame,And who ſo hath wy the ſence to expoune,Shal fynde, that to brydle the Prince of a Realme,Is euen (as who ſayth) to ſtryue with the ſtreame:Note this all ſubiectes and conſtrue it well,And buſie not your Braynes about the Cats bel.But in that ye be Lieges learne to obay,Submitting your willes to your Princes Lawes,It ſitteth not a ſubiect to haue his owne waye,Remember this prouer be of the Cats clawes:For Princes like Lyons haue long and large pawesThat reach at Randon, and whom they once twitch,They claw to the boane before the ſkinne itch.But to my purpoſe, I being once bent,Towardes the atchieving of my attemptate.Foure bold Barons were of myne aſſent,By oath and aliaunce faſtlye confederate,Firſt Henry of Derby an Earle of eſtate,Richard of Arundel, and Thomas of Warwicke,With Mowbray the Marſhal, a man moſt warlike.At Ratecote bridge aſſembled our band,The commons in cluſters came to vs that day,To daunt Robert Veer, then Duke of Ireland,By whom King Richard was ruled alway,We put him to flight and brake his array,Then Maugre the king his leaue or aſſent,By Conſtables power we cald a Parliament.Where not in Roabes, but with Baſlardes bright,We came for to parle of the Publique weale,Confirming our quarel with maine and with might,With ſwordes and no wordes we tryed our appeale,In ſteede of reaſon declaring our zeale,And whom ſo we knew with the king in good grace,We playnly depriued of power and of place.Some with ſhort proceſſe were banniſht the Land,Some executed with capitall payne,VVherof who ſo liſ, the whole to vnderſtand,In the Parliament rolle it appeareth playne,And further how ſtoutly we did the king ſtraine,The rule of his realme wholy to reſigne,To the order of thoſe, whom we did aſſigne.But note the ſequele of ſuch preſumption,Afer we had theſe Myracles thus wrought,The kinge inflamed with indignation,By Subiectes thus in bondage to bee brought,Suppreſſge the Ire of his inward thought:Studied nought els but how that he might,Be highly reuenged of this high diſpight.Agreeued was alſo this later offence,With former cauſe of  to renewe,For once at Wyndſor I brought to his preſence,The Maior of London with all his retinewe,,To aſke accoumpt of the Realmes reuenew:And the Souldiers of Breſt by me were made boldTo clayme their wages, when the towne was ſolde.Theſe griefes remembred with all the remnaunt,Fulfyld his hart with hate out of meaſure,Yet openly in ſhew made he no ſemblaunt,By word or by deede to beare diſpleaſure:But Frendſhip fayned, in proofe is found vnſure.And who ſo truſteth a foe reconcilde,Is for the moſt part alwayes beguilde.For as fier ill quencht will vp at a ſtart,And ſores not wel ſalued do breake out of new,So hatred hidden in an ireful hart,Where it hath not had long ſeaſon to brew,Vpon euery occaſion doth eaſely renew:Not fayling at laſt, if it be not let,To pay large vſurie beſides the due de,Euen ſo it fared by this frendſhip fayned,Outwardly ſound and inwardly rotten:For when the kings fauour in ſeeming was gayned:All olde diſpleaſures forgeeuen and forgotten,Euen than at a ſoden the ſhaft was ſhotten,Which pearced my hart voyd of miſtruſt,Alas that a Prince ſhould be ſo vniuſt.For lyinge at Plaſhey my ſelfe to repoſe,With long ſickneſſ diſeaſed very ſore:The King eſpying me apart from thoſe,With whom I was confedered before,Thought it not meete to tract the time moreBut glad 'to take me at ſuch aduauntage,Came to ſalute mee with frendly viſage.Who hauing a Band bound to his bent,By colour of kindneſſe to viſite his Eame,Tooke tyme to accompliſh his cruel entent:And in a ſmall veſſel downe by the ſtreame,Conueid me to Calais out of the realme,Where without proceſſe or doome of my peares,Not nature but murder abridged my yeares.This act was odious to God and to man,Yet rigour to cloake to hait of reaſon,By craftye compaſſe deuiſe they can,Articles nine of right haynous treaſon:But doome after death is ſure out of ſeaſon,For who euer ſaw ſo ſtraunge a preſident,As execution to goe before iudgement.Thus hate harboured in depth of mynde,By ſought occaſion burſt out of new.And culye abuſed the lawe of kinde,When that the Nephue the vncle ſlew,Alas King Richard, ſore maiſt thou rue-Which by this fact preparedſt a playne waye,Of thy hard deſtenye to haſten the daye.For bloud axeth bloud as guerdon due,And vengeaunce for vengeaunce is iuſt rewarde:O righteous God thy iudgementes are true,For looke what meaſure to others we awarde,The ſame for vs againe is preparde:Take heede ye princes by examples paſt,Bloud wil haue bloud eyther firſt or laſt.FINIS.G.

WHen maiſter Ferrers had ended this fruictfull Tragedye, becauſe no mā was readye with an other, hauing peruſed the ſtorie which came next, ſayde: becauſe you ſhall not ſaye (my mayſters) but that I will ſomewhat doe my parte. I wyll vnder your correction, declare the tragedye of Thomas Mowbrey, Duke of Northfolke, the chiefe worker of the Duke of Gloceſters deſtruction: who to admoniſh all counſaylours to bware of Flattring Princes or falſely enuying or accuſing their Peregalles, may lamēt his vyces in maner folowinge.

# HOVV THE LORDE Mowbray promoted by Kynge Rychard the ſeconde, to the State of a Duke, was by him Baniſhed the Realme, in the yeare of Chriſte. 1398. and after died myſerably in exile.
THough ſorrowe and ſhame abaſh me to reherce,My lothſome lyfe and death of due deſerued,Yet that the paynes thereof may other pearce,To leaue the like, leaſt they be likewiſe ſerued,Ah Baldwin marke, aud ſee how that I ſwerued:Diſſemblinge, enuy, and Flattery, bane that beeOf al their Hoſts, haue ſhewed their power on mee.A blame not fortune though ſhe did her part,And true it is, ſhe can do little harme,She guideth goods, ſhe hampreth not the hart,A minde well ent, is ſafe from euery charme:Vice, onely vice, with her ſtout ſtrengthleſſe arme,Doth cauſe the heart from good to ill encline,Whych I alas, do finde to true by myne.For where by birth I came of noble race,The Mowbreys heyre, a famouſe houſe and olde,Fortune I thanke, gaue me ſo good a grace,That of my Prince I had what ſo I wolde:Yet neyther was, to other greatly holde,For I through flattery abuſd his wanton youth,And his fond truſt augmented my vntruth.Hee made mee firſt the Earle of Notingham,And Marſhall of England, in which eſtateThe Pieres and people ioyntly to mee came,With ſore complaint, againſt them that of lateMade officers, had brought the kinge in hate,By makinge ſale of Iuſtice, right, and Lawe,And liuinge naught: without all dreade or awe.I gaue them ayde theſe euils to redreſſe,And went to London with an army ſtrong,And cauſed the king, againſt his will oppreſſeBy cruell death, all ſuch as led him wrong:The Lord chiefe Iuſtice ſuffered theſe among,So did the Steward of his houſhold head,The Chauncellor ſcapt, for he aforehand fled.Theſe wicked men thus from the king remoued,Who beſt vs pleaſed ſucceeded in their place:For which both Kinge, and Commons mutch vs loued,But chiefly I with all ſtoode high in grace,The Kinge enſued my rede in euery caſe,Whence ſelfe loue bred: for glory maketh proude,And pryde ay looketh alone to bee allowde.Wherefore to th'ende I might alone enioyThe Kinges fauour, I made his luſt my lawe:And where of late I laboured to deſtroy,Sutch flatteringe folke, as thereto ſtode in awe,Now learned I amonge the reſt to clawe:For pride is ſutch, if it be kindly caught,As ſtroyeth good, and ſtirreth vp euery naught.Pryde prouoketh to flatter for the pray,To poll, and oppreſſe for maintenaunce of the ſame,To malice ſuch as match vnethes it may:And to be briefe, pride doth the hart enflame,To fyre what miſchiefe any fraud may frame,And euer at length the euils by it wroughtConfound the worker and bring him vnto nought.Behold in me due proofe of euery part,For pryde prickt me firſt my prince to flatterSo much, that who ſo euer pleaſed his hart,Were it neuer ſo euil, I thought it a lawfll matter,Which cauſed the Lordes afreſh againſt him clatter:Becauſe of Holdes beyond the ſea that e ſolde.And ſeene his ſouldiers of their wages polde.Though all theſe ills were done by myne aſſent,Yet ſuch was lucke that ech man deemed no:For ſee the Duke of Gloceſtre for me ſent,With other Lordes whoſe hartes did bleede for woe,To ſee the Realme ſo faſt to ruine goe:In fault whereof, they ſayd the two Dukes were,The one of Yorke, the other of Lancaſter.On whoſe remoue from place about the kingWe all agreed, and ſware a ſolemne oth,And whilſt the reſt prouided for this thing,I flatterer I, to wyn the prayſe of troth:Wretch that I was brake fayth and promiſe both:For I bewrayed the King, their whole intent,For which vnwares they all were tane and ſhent.Thus was the warder of the Common weale,The Duke of Gloceſter giltleſſe made away,With other moe, more wretch I ſo to deale,Who through vntruth their truſt did ill betraye:Yet by this meanes obteyned I my praye,Of king and Dukes I found for this ſuch fauour,As made me Duke of Northfolke for my labour.But ſee how pryde and enuye ioyntly runne,Becauſe my Prince did more then me preferre,Syr Henry Bolenbroke the Eldeſt ſonneOf Iohn of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaſter,Proude I that would alone be blazing ſterre,Enuied this Duke, for nought ſaue that the ſhyneOf his deſertes, did gliſter more then mine.To thend therfore his light ſhould be the leſſe,I ſlylye ſought al ſhiftes to put it out,But as the poyze that would the palmetree preſſe,Doth cauſe the bowes ſprede larger round about,So ſpite and enuye cauſeth glory ſproute,And aye the more the toppe is ouer trode,The deeper doth the ſound roote ſpreade abrode.For when this Henrye Duke of Hereford ſawe,What ſpoye the King made of the noble blood,And that without al Iuſtice, cauſe, or lawe:To ſuffer him ſo, be thought not ſure nor good,Wherefore to me twofaced in one hood,As touching this he fully brake his myndeAs to his frend that ſhould remedye fynde.But I, although I knewe my Prince did ill,So that my heart abhorred ſore the ſame,Yet miſchiefe ſo through malice led my will,To bringe this Duke from honour vnto ſhame,And toward my ſelfe, my Soueraygne to enflame:That I bewraye his Words vnto the King,Not as a reade, but as a moſt haynous thing.Thus where my duty bounde me to haue toldeMy Prince his fault, and wild him to refrayne,Through flattery loe, I did his ill vpholde,VVhich turnd at length both him and mee to payne:VVo, wo to Kinges whoſe counſaylours do fayne,VVo, wo to Realmes where ſutch are put in truſt,As leaue the lawe, to ſerue the Princes luſt.And wo to him that by his flatteringe rede,Maynteyns a Prince in any kinde of vice:VVo worth him eke for enuy, pryde or mede,That miſreportes any honeſt enterpriſe,Becauſe I beaſt, in all theſe poynctes was nice,The plagues of all together on me light,And due for ill: All doers doth acquite.For when the Duke was charged with my plaint,Hee flat denied that any part was true,And claymde by Armes, to aunſwere his attaint,And I by vſe, that Warly feates well knewe,To his deſire incontinently drewe:VVherewith the Kinge did ſeeme right well content,As one that paſt not mutch with whom it went.At time and place appoyncted wee appeard,At all poynctes Armed to proue our Quarelles Iuſt,And whan our Freendes on ech part had vs cheard,And that the Harolds had vs do our luſt:With ſpeare in reſt we toke a courſe to iuſt.But ere our horſes had runne halfe theyr way,A ſhoute was made the Kng commaunded ſtaye.And for to auoyde the ſheddinge of our bloud,VVith ſhame, and death which one muſt needes haue had,The Kinge through counſayle of the Lordes thought goodTo baniſhe both, wich iudgement ſtrait was rad:No maruayle than though both were wroth and ſadBut chiefly I, that was Exild for aye,My Enmy ſtraungd but for ten yeares daye.The date expird, whan by this doubtfull dome,I ſhould depart to liue in baniſht hand,On payne of death to England not to come,I went my way: the Kinge ſead in his handMyne Offices, my Honours, Good, and Land,To paye the due as openly hee tould,Of mighty ſummes, which I had from him pold.See Baldwin ſee, the ſalary of ſinne,Marke with what meede, vile vices are regardedThrough Pride, and Enuy looſe both kith, and kinne,And for my flatteringe plaint ſo well rewarded,Exile, and ſlaunder are iuſt to mee awarded:My Wyfe, and Heire lacke Laudes, and lawfull Right,And mee theyr Lord made Dame Dianais Knight.If theſe miſhaps at home bee not enough,Adioyne to them my Sorrowes in Exile:I went to Almayne firſt, a Land right rough,In which I founde ſutch churliſhe Folke, and vile,As made mee lothe my life ech otherwhile:There lo, I learnd what it is to bee a geſtA broade, and what to liue at home in reſt.For they eſteeme no one man more than ech,They vſe as well the Lackey as the Lorde,And like their maners churliſhe in their ſpech,Their lodging hard, theyr bourd to bee abhord,Their pleityd Garments herewith well accord,All Iagde, and Frounſt, with diuers coulours deckt,They ſweare, they curſe, and drincke till they be flekt.They hate all ſuch, as theſe their maners hate,VVhich reaſon would, no Wiſeman ſhould allowe,VVith theſe I dwelt, lamentinge myne eſtate,Till at the length they had got knowledge, howeI was exilde, becauſe I did auoweA falſe complaint, agaynſt my truſty freende,VVhich made them thinke, mee worſe then any feende.That what for ſhame, and what for other griefe,I parted thence, and went to Venice towne,VVhereas I found, more pleaſure and reliefe,VVhich was not longe: for now the great renowne,Of Bolenbroke whom I, would haue put downe,VVas waxt ſo great in Britayne, and in Fraunce,That Venice through, ech man did him Auaunce.Loo! thus his Glory grewe great, by my diſpite,And I thereby increaſed in defame:So enuy euer, her hatred doth acquiteVVith Trouble, Anguiſhe, Sorrowe, and ſelfe Shame,VVhereby her Foes do ſhine in higher Fame:Lyke Water waues, which clenſe the Muddy ſtone,And ſoyle themſelues by beatinge thereupon.Or eare I had ſoiourned there a yeare,Straunge tidings came, he was to England gone,Had tae the Kinge, and that which touched him neare,Empriſoned him with other of his Fone,And made him yeelde him vp his Crowne, and Throne:VVhen I theſe thinges for true by ſearch had tryed,Griefe griped me ſo, I pined a way and died.Note here the ende of pryde, ſee Flatteries fyne,Marke the rewarde of enuy, and falſe complaynt,And warne all people from them to decline,Leaſt likely fault do finde the like attaynte.Let this my lyfe, to them be a reſtraynt,By others harmes who liſteth take no hede:Shall by his owne, learne other better rede.FINIS.T.

THis tragical example was of al the company wel liked, howbeit a doubt was foūd therin, & that by means of the diuerſity of ye Chronicles  for whereas Hall (whoſe Chronicle in this woorke was chiefelye folowed) maketh Mowbry appellant, and Bolenbroke defendant. Fabian reporteth the matter quite contrarye, and that by recorde of the Parliament rolle, wherein it is plain that Bolenbroke was appellant & Morobrey defendant wherfore whatſoeuer ſhalbe ſayde in the perſō of Mowbrey (who being a moſt noble prince had to much wrong to be ſo cauſeles defamed after his death) imagine the ſame to be ſpoken agaynſte his accuſer. Which matter ſyth it is more harde to decide, than nedefull to our yurpoſe, which mynde only to diſſwade frō vices & exalt vertue, we refer to ſuch as may come by the Recordes of the Parliament, contented in the meane while with Mayſter Halles iudgement, which maketh beſt for our foreſhewed purpoſe.

This doubt thus let paſſe. I would ſayd M, Ferrers, ſaye ſomwhat for K. Rich. the 2. after whoſe depriuing, his brother & diuers other made a maſke mynding by K. Henries deſtructiō to haue reſtored him, which maſkers matter ſo runneth in this yt I doubt which ought to goe before, but ſeeing no mā is ready to ſay ought in their behalfe, I wyll geue (who ſo liſteth) leaſure to think thereon, & in ye meane time to further your enrerpriſe. I will in K. Richards behalfe recount ſuch part of his ſtorye, as I thinke moſt neceſſary. And therfore imagin Baldwin y• you ſee y• corps of this Prince al to be māgled, wt bloudy woundes, lyinge pale and wanne, naked  vpon a Beere in Paules Church, the People ſtanding round about him, and making his complaint in maner as foloweth.

# HOWE KINGE RICHARDE the ſecond was for his euil gouernaunce depoſed from his ſeate, in the yeare 1399. & miſerably murthered in priſon the yeare folowing.
HApyye is the Prince, that hath in wealth the graceVertue to folow and vyces to keepe vnder,But woe to him whoſe wyl hath wiſdomes place:For who ſo renteth right and law aſunder,On him at length all the world ſhall wonder,Boaſt of high byrth, ſword, ſcepter, ne mace.Can warrant King or Keyſer fro the caſe,Shame ſueth ſinne, as rayne do drops of thunder,Let kinges therfore the Lawes of God embrace,That vayne delightes cauſe them not to blunderBeholde my hap, ſee how the ſeely routeOn me do gaze, and ech to other ſay:See where he lyeth, but late that was ſo ſtoute,Loe how the power, the Pride, and rich aray,Of mighty Princes lightly fade away.The King which earſt kept all the realme in doubt,Dead and leaſt dread, to graue is caryed out,What would be Kinges made of but earth and clay:Behold the woundes his body all about,Whe liuing here, thought neuer to decay.Mee thinke I heare the people thus deuiſeWherefore Baldwin, ſith thou wilt now declareHow Princes fell, to make the liuinge wiſe,My lawleſſe life, in no poynct ſee thou ſpare,But paint it out, that rulers may beware,Good counſayle, Lawe, or vertue to diſpiſe:For Realmes haue rulers, and rulers haue a ſiſe,Which if they breake, thus mutch to ſay I dare,That eythers griefes, the other ſhall agriſeTill one be loſt, the other brought to care.I was a Kinge, who ruled all by LuſtWithout reſpect of Iuſtice, Right, or Lawe,In falſe Flatterers repoſinge all my truſt,Embracinge ſutch as could my vices clawe:Fro counſell ſage I did alwayes withdrawe,As pleaſure prickt, ſo nedes obay I muſt:Hauinge delite to feede and ſerue the guſt,Of God or man I ſtood no wiſe awe,Mee liked leaſt to Torney or to Iuſt.To Venus games my Fanſy did more drawe.Which to mayntayne, I gathered heapes of goldeBy Fines, Fiftenes, and loanes by way of preſt,Blanke Charters, Othes, and ſhiftes not knowen of olde,For which the people, my doinges did deteſt.I alſo ſould the noble towne of Breſt,My fault wherein, becauſe mine vncle tolde,(For Princes actes, may no wiſe he controld)His lyfe I tooke, vntried without Queſt,And all ſutch Lordes as did his cauſe vphold,Wyth long exile, or cruell death oppreſt.None ayde I lackt, in any wicked deede,For gayinge Gulles, whom I promoted had.Would further all in hoope of higher eede,There can no Kinge, ymagin ought ſo bad,But ſhall fynde ſome, to do the ſame moſt glad:For ſickneſſe ſeldome doth ſo ſwiftly breede,As humours ill, do growe the griefe to feede.Thus Kinges eſtatas, bee worſt of all beſtad.Auſde to wealth, abandoned at neede,And neareſt harme when they be leaſt adrad.My lyfe and death the truth of this hath tryed:For whyle I ſought in Ireland with my foes,Myne vncle Edward, whom I left to guideMy Realme at home, rebelliouſly aroſe,Traytors to helpe, which plied my depoſe:And cald fro Fraunce, Earle Bolenkroke whom IExiled had, for ten yeares there to lye:VVho tyrantlike did execute all thoſe,That in mine ayde durſt looke but once awry,Of which ſort ſooneafter ſome their liues did loſe.For comming backe this ſoden ſtur to ſtaye,My Steward falſe to whom I truſted moſt:(VVhiles I in Wales at Flint my caſtle, laye,Both to refreſh and multiply myne Oſte)There in any Hall, mindinge to fly the Coaſt,His Staffe did breake, which was my houſehold ſtayBad ech make ſhift and rode himſelfe away.See Princes, ſee, the ſtrength whereof wee boaſt,VVhom moſt wee truſt, at neede do vs Betray:No better ſtay, then in a rotten Poſt.My Steward falſe, thus being fled and gone,My ſeruantes ſlye ſhrancke of on euery ſyde,Then caught I was, end led vnto my ſoen,Who for their Prince no Pallaice did prouide,But priſon ſtrong, where Henry puft with pryde,Cauſde we reſigne, abandonig my throane,And ſo forſaken and left as poſt alone,Theſe holow frendes, y Henrye ſone eſpyed,Became ſuſpect, and faith was geeuen to none,Which cauſed them from fayth agayn to ſlyde.Conſpiring ſtreight their new Prince to put downe,Which to performe a ſolempne othe they ſwore,To tender me my ſceter and my crowne,Wherof themſelues, depriued me before,But ate medcines can helpe no feſtred ſore:When ſwelling flouds haue ouerflowen the towne,To late it is to ſaue them that ſhal drowne,Tyl ſayles he ſpred a ſhyppe may keepe the ſhore,No anchor hold can keepe the veſſel downe,When winde and ſtreame hath ſet the ſeas in rore.For though the Peres ſet Henrye in ſuch ſtate,Yet could they not diſpiace him thence agayne:And where with eaſe my pride they did abate.They ere to weake to ſet me vp agayne,Thinges hardly mend, but may be mard amayne.And when a man is fallen by froward fate,Stil miſchiefes ight one on anothers pace:And meanes wl ment al miſhaps to reſtraineWaxe wretched moanes, whereby his ioyes a bate.Due proofe whereof, in this appeared playne.For whan the kinge did know that for my cauſe,His Lordes in Maſke, would murder him by ight,To dah al doubtes, he tooke no further pauſe:But Pirs of Exto a cruel cutt throate knight,To Pfret Caſtel ſent with great diſpite,Who reft my lyfe by force againſt al Lawes,Thus lawleſſe lyfe to lawleſſe death ay drawes.Wherfore  kinges be rulde, and rule by right.And ſo I end concluding with this clauſe:That God though ſate, at laſt wil ſurely ſmyte.FINIS.G.

WHen Maiſter Ferrers had ended this ſo woful a Tragedye, and to all Princes a right worthy inſtruction: hauing paſſed through a miſeable time full of piteous Tragedies, we pauſed a while. And ſeeing ye reign of Henry the fowerth enſued, a Prince more ware and Proſperous in his doinges, although not vntroubled with warres, both of outfoorth and inward enemies: we began to ſearch what Peers were fallen therein, where of the nomber was not ſmall. And yet becauſe their examples were not much to be noted for our purpoſe, we paſſed ouer all the Maſkes of whom king Richardes brother was chiefe: which were al ſlaine and put to Death for their trayterous attempt. And fynding Owen  Glendour, a great Prince in Wales, next in ſucceſion of ill Fortune with the ſtout Percies his confederates, I thought it not meete to ouerpaſſe, ſo great perſons with ſilence, and therefore ſayd thus to the ſylent company: What my maiſters is euery man at once in a browne ſtudy? hath no mā affectiō to any of theſe ſtories? you minde ſo much ſome other belike, that theſe do not moue you: and to ſay the truth, there is no ſpecial cauſe why they ſhould. Howe be it Owen Glendour, becauſe he was one of Fortunes owne darlingrs, and affected to bee Monark of Wales, although to his owne miſchiefe and deſtruction, rather then he ſhould be forgottē, I wil pray Maiſter Phaer who of late hath placed hymſelfe in that country, & haply hath met with his ghoſt in the foreſt of Kylgarran that he wil ſay ſomwhat in his perſon: which Owen comming out of the wylde Mountaines of Wales like the image of Death in al pointes (his harte onely excepted) as a ghoſt forpined with extreame famine, cold and hunger, may lamente his great miſfortune in ſutch maner as you maiſter Phaer are able moſt aptly to vtter and ſet forth.

I Pray thee Baldwin ſith thou doſt entend,To ſhewe the fall of ſutch as climbe to hye,Remember mee, whoſe miſerable endeMay teach all men Ambition to flye,Oh falſe Fortune, Fortune vengeaunce on thee I crye:VVhich offeringe a Sop of ſweete receyt,Haſte made me byte the Hooke in ſteede of Bayt.A Brytton borne, and of the Tropan bloud,But ill brought vp, whereby full well I finde,That neyther byrth nor Linage make vs good:Though it be true that Cat will after kinde,Fleſhe gendreth fleſhe, but not the Soule or Minde,They gender not, but fouly do degender,When men to vice, from vertue they ſurrender.Eche thinge by nature, tendeth to the ſameWhereof it came, and is diſpoſed like:Downe ſincks the mould, vp mountes the fiery flame,With Horne the Hart, with Hoofe the Horſe doth ſtrike,The Wolfe doth ſpoyle, the ſuttle Foxe doth pike,And to conclude, no fiſhe, fleſhe, foule, or plantOf their true dame, the property doth want.But as for men, ſyth ſeuerally they haueA minde whoſe maners are by learninge made,Good bringinge vp, al onely doth them ſaue,In honeſt actes, which with their Parentes fade,So that true gentry ſtandeth in the tradeOf vertues life, not in the fleſhly lyne:For bloud is brute, but Gentry is deuine.Experience, doth cauſe me thus to ſay,And that the rather for my countrey men,Which vaunt & boaſt themſelues aboue the day,If they may ſtraine their ſtocke fro worthy men:VVhich let be true, are they the better then?Nay farre the worſe, if ſo they bee not good,For why they ſtayne the beuty of ther blood.How would we mocke the burden bearinge Mule,If hee would brag he were an horſes Sunne,To preſſe his pride (might nothing els him rule)His boaſtes to proue, no more but did him run:The horſe for ſwiftnes hath his glory wonne,The Mule coulde neuer the more aſpyer,Though hee ſhould proue that Pegas was his Sier.Ech man crake of that which was his owne,Our Parentes vertues are theirs, and no wit ours,Who therefore wil of noble byrth be knowen,Ought ſhine in vertue like his Aunceſtours,Gentry conſiſteth not in Landes, and Towers:Hee is a churle though all the World were his,Yea Arthurs heyre, if that hee lyue amiſſe.For vertuous lyfe a Gentleman doth make,Of her poſſeſſour all be he poore as Iob,Yea thoughe no name of elders he can take:For proofe take Merlin fathered by an Hob.But who ſo ſets his minde to ſpoyle and rob,Although he come by due diſcent from Brute,He is a chorle, vngentle, vile, and brute,Well, thus did I for want of better witte,Becauſe my parents naughtely brought me vp:For Gentlemen (they ſayd) was nought ſo fitte,As to attaſt by bould attemptes the cup,Of conqueſtes wyne, wherof I thought to ſup:And therefore bent my ſelfe to rob and ryue,And whome I could of Laudes, and goods depriue.For Henry the fourth did then vſurpe the Crowne,Deſpoyled the Kinge, with Mortimer the heyre:For which his ſubiectes ſought to put him dwne,And I while Fortune offered mee ſo fayre,Did what I might, his honour to appayre:And tooke on mee to bee the Prince of Wales,Entiſte thereto by prophecies, and tales.For which, ſutch Idle, as wayte vpon the ſpoyle,From euery part of VVales vnto mee drew,For loytering youth vntaught in any toyle,Are ready aye all miſchiefe to enſue:Through helpe of theſe ſo great my glory grewe,That I defyed my Kynge through lofty harte,And made ſharpe VVarre on all that tooke his parte,See lacke, I took Lord Raynold Gray of Rythen,And him enforſt my Daughter to eſpouſe,And ſo vnraunſomed I held him ſtill, and ſythen,In Wigmore lande through battayle rigorous,I caught the right heire of the crowned houſe:The Earle of March ſit Edmond Mortier,And in a Dungeon kept him priſoner.Than all the Marches longinge onto Wales,By Seuerne Weſt I did inuade and burne:Deſtroyed the Townes, in Mountaynes, and in Vales,And rich in Spoyles had homeward ſaulfe returne:VVas none ſo hold durſt once againſt me ſpurne,Thus proſperouſly doth Fortune forwarde call,Thoſe whom ſhee mindes to geue the ſoreſt fall.VVhan Fame had brought theſe tidings to the King,(Although the Scottes than vexed him right ſore)A mighty army agaynſt mee he did bring:VVhereof the French Kinge beinge warned afore,VVho

ayne,Hee ſtale to Ship, and ſayled home agayne.Twelue thouſand moe in Milford did ariue,And came to me then lyinge at Denbigh,VVith armed Welſhmen Thouſandes double fyue,VVith whom wee went to Worceſter well nigh,And there Encampt vs on a mount on high,To abide the kinge who ſhortly after cameAnd pitched his field, on a hill hard by the ſame.There eight dayes longe our Hoaſtes lay face, to face,And neyther durſt others power aſſayle:But they ſo ſtopt the paſſages the ſpace,That victayles coulde not come to our auayle,VVhere through conſtraynde our heartes began to fayle:So that the Frenchmen ſhranke away by night,And I with mine to the Mountaynes tooke our flight:The Kinge purſued greatly to his coſt,From Hilles to Woods, from Woods to Valleis playne:And by the way his men and ſtuffe bee loſt.And whan hee ſawe, hee gayned nought but payne,Hee blewe retreate, and gat him home agayne:Then with my power I boldly came abrode,Taken in my Countrey for a very God.Immediatly after fell a Iolly IarreBtwene the Kinge, and Percies worthy blouds,VVhich grew at laſt vnto a deadly Warre:For like as drops Engender mighty Flouds,And litle ſeedes ſprut forth great Leaues, and buds,Euen ſo ſmall ſtriues, if they bee ſuffered run,Brede wrath and warre, and death or they bee don.The Kinge would haue the Raunſome of ſutch Scots,As theſe the Percies tane had in the fielde:But ſee how ſtongly lacre knits her knots,The Kinge will haue, the Percies will not yeeld,Deſire of gooos ſome craues, but graunteth ſeeld:Oh curſed goods deſire of you hath wroughtAll wickednes, that hath, or can bee thought.The Percies deemed it meeter for the King,To haue redeemed their Cooſin Mortimer,VVho in his Quarell all his power did bring,To fight with mee, that tooke him Pryſoner,Than of their pray to rob his Souldier:And therefore willed him ſee ſome meane were ound,To quite forth him, whom I kept vily bound.Bycauſe the Kinge miſliked their requeſt,They came themſelues and did accord with mee,Complayninge how the Kingdome was oppreſtBy Henries rule, wherefore wee did agreeTo put him downe, and part the realme in three:The North part theirs, Wales wholly to bee mine,The reſt, to reſt to Th'earle of Marches Line.And for to ſet vs hereon more agog,A Prophet came (a vengeaunce take them al)Affirminge Henry to bee Gog magog,VVhom Merlin doth a Mould warp euer call,Accurſt of God that muſt bee brought in thrallBy a Wolfe, a Dragon, and a Lion ſtrong,VVhich ſhould deuide, his Kingdome them among.This crafty dreamer made vs three ſutch beaſtes,To thinke wee were the foreſayd beaſtes in deede.And for that cauſe our Badges, and our Creaſtes,VVee ſearched out which ſcarſely well agreed:Howbeit the Haroldes redy at ſutch a neede,Drewe downe ſutch Iſſues from olde Aunceſters,As proued theſe Enſignes to bee ſurely oures.Yee crafty Welſhemen, wherefore do yee mocke,The noble men thus with your fayned rimes?Yee Noble men why flye yee not the Flocke,Of ſutch as haue ſeduced ſo many times?Falſe Propheſies are Plagues for diuers crimes,VVhich God doth let the deuiliſh ſort deuiſe,To trouble ſutch as are not godly Wiſe.And that appeared by vs three beaſtes in deede,Through falſe perſwaſion highly borne in hand,That in our feate wee could not chuſe but ſpeede,To kill the Kinge, and to enioy his Land:For which exployt wee bound our ſelues in band,To ſtand contented ech man with his parte,So fully, folly aſſured our fooliſh harte.But ſutch they ſay as fiſhe before the Net,Shall ſeldome ſurfet of the Pray they take,Of thinges to come the haps bee ſ vnſet,That none but Fooles may warrant of them make:The full aſſured, ſucceſſe doth oft forſake.For Fortune findeth none ſo fyt to flout,As ſureſby Sots, which caſt no kinde of doubt.How ſayeſt thou Henry Hotſpur, do I ly?For thou right manly gaueſt the Kinge a Fielde,And there waſt ſlayne becauſe thou wouldſt not flye,Syr Thomas Percy thine Vncle forſt to yeelde,Did caſt his head a wonder ſeene but ſeelde,From Shrewſbury

Henry his eldeſt Sonne:VVith all his power to meete mee if hee might:But I diſcomfit, through my Partners fight,Had not the heart to meete him face, to face,But fled away, and hee purſued the

WHan mayſter Phaer had ended the Tragedy of thys hunger ſtaruen Prynce of Wales, it was well liked of all the company that a Saxō would ſpeake ſo mutch for a Bytton, then ſodenly one found a doubt worth the mouinge and yt cōcerning this title, Thearle of March: for as it appereth, there were three men of three diuers nations together in one time entituled by that honour: firſt ſir Edmund Mortimer, whom Owē kept in Priſon, an Engliſhman: the ſecond y• Lord George of Dunbar a valiaunt Scot, baniſhed out of his countrey, & well eſteemed of Henry the .iiij: the third Lord Iames of Bourbon a Frenchman, ſent by the French king to helpe Owen Glendour. Theſe three men had this title all at once, which cauſed him to aſke how it was true that euery one of theſe coulde be Earle of Marche: whereto was aunſwered, that euery countrey hath Marches belonging vnto them, & thoſe ſo large, that they were Earldomes, & the Lords thereof intituled thereby: ſo ye lord Edmūd Mortimer was Earle of Marche in England, lorde Iames of Burbō of y• Marches of Fraunce, and Lord George of Dunbar Earle of the Marches in Scotland. For otherwiſe neyther could haue intereſt in others title. This dout thus diſſolued, maiſter Ferrers ſayd: if no mā haue affection to the Percies, let vs paſſe the times both of Henry the fourth, and the fift, and come to Henry ye  ſixt, in whoſe time Fortune (as ſhe doth in the mynority of Princes) bare a great ſtroke among ye nobles. And yet in Henry the fourths time are examples which I would wiſh Baldwin yt you ſhoulde not forget, as the conſpiracy made by the Byſhop of Yorcke, and the Lord Mowbray, ſonne of him whom you late treated of: pricked forward by the Earle of Northumberland, father to ſir Henry Hotſpur, who fled himſelfe, but his partners were apprehended & put to death, with Baynton and Blinkinſops, which could not ſe their duty to their king but tooke parte wyth Percy that baniſhed Rebell. As he was proceedinge, hee was deſired to ſtay by one which had pondered the ſtory of the Percies, who briefly ſayde. To the ende Baldwin that you may knowe what to ſaye of the Percies, whoſe ſtory is not all out of memory (and it is an notable ſtory) I wyll take vpon me the perſon of the Lord Henry Percy Earle of Northumberland, father of Syr Henry Hotſpur, in whoſe behalfe this may be ſayde as followeth. *⁎*

# ❧HOVV HENRYE Percy Earle of Northumberlande, was for his couetous, and trayterous attempt put to death at Yorke. Anno. 1407.
O Moral Senec, true finde I thy ſayinge,That neither kin, riches, ſtrength or fauourAce free from Fortune, but are aye decayinge:No worldly wealth is ought ſaue doubtful labourMans life in Earth is like vnto a Tabour.Which now to myrth doth mildly men prouokeAnd ſtraight to Warre with a more ſturdy ſtroke.All this full true I Percy finde by proofe,Which whilom was Earle of Northumberland:And therefore Baldwin for my Piers behoofe,To note mens falles ſith thou haſt tane in hande,I would thou ſhould my ſtate well vnderſtand:For fewe Kinges were more than I redoubted,Whom double Fortune lifted vp and loutedAs for my kinne their nobleneſſe is knowen,My valiaunt actes were folly for to prayſe,Where through ye Scots ſo oft were ouerthrowen.That who but I was doubted in my dayes:And that king Richard found at all aſſayes,For neuer Scots rebelled in his raygne,But through my force were eyther caught or ſlaine.A Brother I had was Earle of Worceſter,Alwayes in Office, and Fauour with the King:And  my Wfe Dae Elinor Mortimer,A Sonne I had, which ſo the Scots did ſting,That being yonge, and but a very ſpring,Heny Hoſpur they gaue him unto name,And though I ſay it, hee did deſerue the ſame.We three triumphied in Kinge Richards tyme,Til Fortune ought both him and vs a ſpite:But chiefely mee, whom clearely from any crime,My Kinge did baniſhe from his fauour quite,Proclayminge mee a traterous Knight:VVhere through falſe ſlaunder forced mee to bee,That which before, I did moſt deadly flee.Let men beware how they true folke defame,Or threaten on them the blame of vices nought,For Infamy breedeth wrath, wreke followeth ſhame:Eke open ſlaunder oftentimes hath broughtThat to effect, that erſt was neuer thought,To bee miſdeemed, men ſuffer in a ſort:But noue can beare the griefe of miſreporte.Becauſe my Kinge did ſhame mee wrongfullyI hated him, and ſo became his foe:And while hee did at Warre in Ireland lye,I did conſpire to turne his Weaie to woe:And through the Duke of Yorcke and other moe,All Royall power from him wee quickly toke,And gaue the ſame to Henry Bolenbroke.Neither did wee this onely for this cauſe,But to ſay truth, force draue vs to the ſame:For hee deſpiſinge God and all his lawes,Slewe whom hee woulde, made ſinne a very game,And ſeeinge neyther age nor counſayle could him tame,VVee thought it well done for the Kingdomes ſake,To leaue his rule, that did all rule forſake.But when ſir Henry had attaynd his place,Hee ſtraight became in all poynctes worſe than hee,Deſtroyed the Piers and ſlewe Kinge Richardes grace,Againſt his othe made to the Lordes and mee:And ſeeking Quarels howe to diſagree,Hee ſhameleſly required mee and my Sonne,To yelde him Scots, which wee in Fielde had wonne.My Nephew alſo Edmonde MortimerThe very heyre apparaunt to the Crowne,VVhom Owen Glendour helde as priſoner,Vilely bound in Dungeon deepe caſt downe,Hee would not Raunſome but did ſelly frowne,Againſt my Brother and mee which for him ſpake,And him Proclaymed Traytour for our ſake,This foule deſpite did cauſe vs to conſpire,To put him downe as wee did Richard erſt,And that wee might this matter ſet on fire,From Owens Iayle, our Cooſin wee remeerſt,And vnto Glendour all our griefes reherſt:VVho made a bond with Mortimer, and mee,To priue the Kinge, and part the Realme in three.But when king Henry heard of this deuiſe,Toward Owen Glendour he ſped him very quicke,My ding by force to ſtop hur enterpryſe:And as the deuil would, than fel I ſicke,Howbeit my brother and ſonne more pollitikeThan proſperous, with an hoſt from Scotland brought,Encountred him at Shreweſbury where they fought.The one was tane and yld, the other ſlaine.And ſhortly after was Owen put to flight:By meanes whereof, I forced was to fayne,That I knew nothing of the former fight.Fraud oft auayles more than doth ſturdy might:For by my fayning I brought him in belife,I knew not that wherein my part was chiefe.And while the kyng thus toke me for his frend,I ſought all meanes my former wrong to wreake,Which that I might bring to the ſoner end,To the biſhop of Yorke I did the matter breake,And to th'earle Marſhall likewiſe did I ſpeake.Whoſe father was through Henryes cauſe exiled,The biſhops brother with trayterous death defiled.Theſe ſtrayt aſſented to do what they could,So did the Lord Haſtings and Lord Faucōbridge:Which altogether promiſed they would,Set all their power, the kinges dayes to abridge,But ſee the ſpite, before the byrdes were flydgeThe Kinge had word and ſeaſoned on the neſt,Whereby alas, my frendes were all oppreſt.The bloudye Tyraunt brought them all to endExcepted me, which into Scotland ſkapt,To George of Dunbar therle of March, my frend,Who in my cauſe all that he could ey ſcrapt,And when I had for greater ſuccour gapte,Both at the Frenchmen and the Fleminges hande,And could get none, I tooke ſuch as I fand.And with the helpe of George my very frend,I did inuade Northumberland ful bold,Where as the folke drew to me ſtyl on end,Bent to death my partie to vphold:Through helpe of theſe ful many a fort and hold,The whiche the king right manfully had mand,I eaſely wonne and ſeaſed in my hand.Not ſo content (for vengeaunce draue me on)I entred Yorkeſhire there to waſt and ſpoyle,But ere I had farre in the countrye gone,The ſheriffe thereof, Rafe Rokeſby did aſſoyle,My troubled hoaſt of much part of our toyle,For he aſſaulting freſhly tooke through power,Me and Lord Barolph both at Bramham more.And thence conueyed vs to the towne of Yorke,Vntil he knew what was the kinges entent,There loe Lord Bardolphe kynder then the StorkeDid looſe his head, which was to London ſent,With whom for Frendſhip mine in like caſe went,This was my hap my fortune or my faute,This lyfe I led, and thus I came to naught.Wherfore good Baldwin wil the Piere take heede,Of ſlaunder, malice, and conſpiracye,Of couetiſe, whence all the reſt procede:For couetiſe ioynt with contuniacye,Doth cauſe al miſchiefe in mens hartes to breede:And therfore this to Eſperance my worde,Who cauſeth Bloudſhed ſhal not eſcape the Sword.FINIS.
BY that this was ended, I had found oute the ſtorye of Richard Earle of Cambridge: becauſe it conteyned matter in it, though not very notable, yet for the better vnderſtandinge of the reſt, I thought it meete to touche it, and therfore ſayd as foloweth: You haue ſayde wel of the Percies and fauourablye, for in deede as it ſhould appeare, the chiefe cauſe of their conſpiracye againſt K. Henry, was for Edmund Mortimer their conſins ſake, whom the king very maliciouſlye proclaymed to haue yelded himſelfe to Owen coulourably, when as in deede hee was taken forciblye againſt his wyl, and very cruelly ordered in Priſon And ſeeing we are in hand with Mortimers matter, I will take vppon me the perſon of Rycharde Plantagenet earle of Cambridge, who for his ſake lykewiſe dyed. And therefore I let paſſe Edmōd Holland Earle of Kent, whom Henry the fowerth  made Admiral to ſkowre the Seas, becauſe yt Britaines were abrode: which Earle (as many things happen in warre) was ſlayne with an arrow at yt Aſſaulte of Briack: ſhortly after whoſe death this king dyed, and his ſonne Henrye the fyft of that name ſucceeded in his place. In the beginning of this Henry the fyftes raigne dyed this Rychard, and with him Hēry the L. Scrope & other, in whoſe behalfe, this maye be ſayde.

# HOVVE RICHARD Plātagenet Earle of Cambridge entending the Kinges deſtruction, was put to death at Southampton. Anno. Domini. 1415.
HAſt maketh waſt, hath commonly bene ſayde,And ſecrete miſchiefe ſeeld hath lucky ſpeede,A murdering minde with proper poyze is wayd,Al this moſt true I fynde it, as my creede,And therfore Baldwin wane al ſtates take hedeHow they conſpyre any other to entrappe,Leaſt miſchiefement light in the meaners lappe.For I Lord Richard heire Plantagenet,Was Earle of Cambridge and right fortunate,If I had had the grace my witte to ſet,To haue content mee with myne owne eſtate:But O falſe honours, breeders of debate,The loue of you our lewde hartes do allure,To leeſe our ſelues by ſeeking you vnſure.Becauſe my brother Edmond Mortimer,Whoſe eldeſt ſiſter was my wedded wife,I meane that Edmund that was priſoner,In Wales ſo long through Owens buſie ſtryte,Becauſe I ſay that after Edmondes lyfe,His rightes and tytles muſt by law be myne,For he e had, nor could encreaſe his lygne.Becauſe the right of Realme and Crowne was ours,I ſearched meanes to helpe him thereunto,And where the Henries held it by their powers,I ſought a ſhift their tenures to vndoe,Which being force, ſith force or ſleight muſt doe:I voyde of might, becauſe their power was ſtrong,Ser priuy ſleight againſt their open wrong.But ſith the Death of moſt part of my kynDid daſh my hope, through out the fathers dayesI let it ſlip, and thought it beſt begyn,Whan as the ſonne ſhould dred leaſt ſuch aſſayes,For force through ſpeede, ſleight ſpeedeth through delayes,And ſeeld doth treaſon time ſo fitlye fynde,As when all daungers moſt bee out of mynde.Wherfore while Henrye of that name the fift,Preparde his army to go conquer Fraunce,Lord Scrope and I thought to attempt a drift,To put him downe my brother to aduaunce,But were it Gods wyll, my lucke, or his good chaunce,The king wiſt wholly where about we went,The night before to ſhipward he him bent.Then were we ſtreight as traytours apprehended,Our purpoſe ſpyed, the cauſe thereof was hid,And therfore loe a falſe cauſe we pretended,Where through my brother was fro daunger ryd:We ſayd for hyre of French kings coyne, we didBehight to kyl the king: and thus with ſhameWe ſtaynd our ſelues, to ſaue our frend fro blame.When wee had thus confeſt ſo foule a treaſon,That we deſerued, we ſuffered by the law,Se Baldwin ſee, and note as it is reaſon,How wicked deedes to woful endes do draw,Al force doth fayle no craft is worth a ſtraw,To attayne thinges loſt, and therfore let them goe.For might ruleth right, and wil though truth ſay no.FINIS.
WHan ſtout Richarde had ſtoutly ſayde his mynde, belike ſayd one, this Rychard was but a little man, or els little fauoured of writers, for our Chronicles ſpeake very litle of him But ſeeing we become now to king Henries voyage into Fraunce, we cannot lacke valiaunte men to ſpeake of, for among ſo many as were led & ſent by the king out of this Realme thither, it cannot be choſen but ſome, & that a great ſomme, were ſlaine among them: wherfore to ſpeake of thē al, I thinke not needeful. And therefore to let paſſe Edwarde Duke of Yorke, and the Earle of Suffolke, ſlayne both at the Battayle of Agincourte, as were alſo many other. Let vs end the tyme of Henry the fift, and come to his ſonne Henry the ſyxte: whoſe Nonage broughte Fraunce and Normandye oute of Bondage, and was the cauſe that ſo few of our noble men dyed aged.

 Of whom to let paſſe the number, I wil take vpō mee the Perſonne of Thomas Montague Earle of Saliſburie, whoſe name was not ſo good at home (and yet he was called the good Earle) as it was dreadful abroade: who exclaminge vppon the mutability of Fortune, may iuſtlye ſay in maner as folqweth.

# HOVVE THOMAS MONtague Earle of Saliſburie, in the middeſt of his glorie, was chaunceablye ſlayne at Orliaunce with a peece of Ordinaunce the third of Nouember. Anno 1428.
WHat fooles be we to truſt vnto our ſtrength,Our wyt, our courage, or our noble fame,Which time it ſelfe muſt needes deuour at length,Though froward fortune could not foyle the ſameBut ſeeing this Goddeſſe guydeth all the game,Which ſtil to chaunge doth ſet her only luſt,Why toyle we ſo for thinges ſo hard to truſt,A goodly thing it is ſurely good report,Which noble hartes, do ſeeke by courſe of kinde:But ſeene the date ſo doubtful and ſo ſhort,The way ſo rough whereby wee do it fynde,I cannot choſe but prayſe the Princely myndeThat preaſeth for it, though we fynde oppreſt,By foule defame thoſe that deſerue it beſt.Concerning whom marke Baldwin what I ſayI meane the vertuous hyndred of their brute,Among which nomber recken wel I may,My valiaunt father Iohn Lord Montacute,Who loſt his lyfe I iudge through iuſt purſute:I ſay the cauſe and not the caſuall ſpeede,Is to be wayde in euery kinde of deede.This rule obſerued, how many ſhall we fynde,For vertues ſake with infamie oppreſt:How many againe through helpe of Fortune blynde:For ill attemptes atchieued with honour bleſt:Succeſſe is worſt ofttimes when cauſe is beſt:Therfore ſay I: God ſend them ſory hapsThat iudge the cauſes by their after claps.The end in deede is iudge of euery thing,Which is the cauſe or latter point of time:The firſt true verdict at the firſt may bring,The laſt is ſlow, or ſlipper as the ſlyme,Oft chaunging names of innocence and crime:Duke Thomas death was Iuſtice two yeares long,And euer ſince, ſore tyranny and wrong.Wherfore I pray thee Baldwin way the cauſe,And praiſe my father as he doth deſerue,Becauſe Earle Henry, King againſt al lawes,Endeuoured king Rychard for to ſtarueIn Iayle, whereby the regal crowne might ſwarue,Out of the ligne to which it than was due,(Whereby God knowes what euil myght enſue)My Lord Iohn Holland Duke of Exceſter,Which was deare coſin to this wretched king,Did moue my father and the Earle of Gloceſter,With other Lordes to ponder wel the thing:Who ſeeing the miſchiefe that began to ſpring,Did all conſent this Henry to depoſe,And to reſtore king Richard to the roſe.And while they did deuiſe a pretie trayne,Whereby to bring their purpoſe better about,Which was in Maſke this Henry to haue ſlayne,The Duke of Awmerle blew their counſel out:Yet was their purpoſe good there is no doubt.What cauſe can bee more worthy for a knight,Than ſaue his king, and helpe true heires to right?For this with them my father was deſtroyed,And buryed in the Dunghil of defame,Thus euil chaunce their glory did auoyde,Whereas their cauſe doth clayme eternal fame:When deedes therfore vnluckely do frame,Men ought not iudge the authours to be nought,For right through might is often ouerraught.And God doth ſuffer that it ſhould be ſo,But why, my wit is feeble to deciſe,Except it be to heape of wrath and woeOn wicked heades that iniuries deuiſe:The cauſe why miſchiefes many times aryſe,And light on them yt would mens wronges redreſſe,Is for the tancour that they beare I geſſe.God hates rigour though it further right,For ſinne is ſynne, how euer it be vſed:And therfore ſuffereth ſhame and death to light,To puniſh vyce, though it be wel abuſed,Who furthereth right is not thereby excuſed.If through the ſame be do ſome other wrong,To euery vice due guerdon doth belong.What preache I now I am a man of warre,And that my body I dare ſay doth profeſſe,Of cured woundes beſet with manye a ſkarre,My broken Iaw vnhealde can ſay no leſſe,O Fortune, Fortune, cauſe of al diſtreſſe:My father had great cauſe thy fraud to curſe,But much more I, abuſed ten times worſe.Thou neuer flattredſt him in al thy lyfe,But me thou dandledſt like thy darling deare,Thy giftes I found in euery corner ryfe,Where euer I went I met thy ſmyling cheare:Which was not for a day, or for a yeare,But through the raigne of three right worthy kingesI found the forward in al kinde of thinges.The while King Henrye conquered in Fraunce,I ſued the warres, and ſtil found victory,In al aſſaultes ſo happy was my chaunce,Holdes yeld or wonne did make my enemies ſorye:Dame Prudence eke augmented ſo my glory,That in al treaties euer I was one,When waighty matters were agreed vpon.But whan this king this mighty conquerour.Through death vnrype was both his realmes bereftHis ſeelye infant did receiue his power,Poore little babe ful young in Cradle left,Where crowne and Scepter urt him with the heft.Whoſe worthy Vncles had the gouernaunce,The one at home the other abroade in Fraunce.And I which was in peace and warre wel ſkylled,With both theſe rulers greatly was eſteemed:Bare rule at home as often as they wylled,And fought in France when they it needeful deemed,And euery where ſo good my ſeruice ſeemed.That Engliſh men to me great loue did beare,Our foes the French, my force fulfilled with feare.I alwayes thought it fitly for a Prince,And ſuch as haue the regiment of Realmes,His ſubiectes hartes with myldeneſſe to connince,With Iuſtice mixt, auoyding all extreames,For like as Phoebus with his cheareful beames,Doth freſhly force the fragrant flowers to floriſh,So rulers myldneſſe ſubiectes loue do noriſh.This found I true: for through my myeld behauiourTheir hartes I had with me to lyue and dye,And in their ſpeach bewrayer of their fauour,They cald me ſtil good Earle of Saliſburie,The Lordes confeſt the commons did not lye:For vertuous lyfe, free hart, and lowly minde,With high and low ſhal alwayes fauour fynde.Which vertues chiefe become a man of warre,Whereof in Fraunce I found experience,For in aſſaultes due mildenes paſſeth farreAl rygour, fore, and ſturdy violence,For men wil ſtoutly ſticke to their defence,When cruel Captaynes couet after ſyoyle,And ſo enforſt, oft giue their foes the foyle.But when they know they ſhalbe frendly vſed,They hazard not their heades but rather yeilde,For this my offers neuer were refuſedOf any towne, or ſurely very ſield,But force and furies fit be for the fielde,And there in deede I vſed ſo the ſame,My foes would flye if they but heard my name.For whan Lord Steward & Earle Vantadore,Had cruellye beſieged Crauant towne,Which he had wonne, and kept long time before,Which lyeth in Awxer on the ryuer Youne:To rayſe the ſiege the regent ſent me downe:Whereas I vſed all rigour that I might,I kylled all that were not ſaued by flight.When therle of Bedforde then in Fraunce Lord Regent,Knew in what ſort I had remoued the ſiege,In Brye and Champaigne he made me Vicegerent,And Lieutenaunt for him and for my liege:Which cauſed me to goe to Brye, and there beſiegeMontaguilon with twentie weekes aſſaut,Which at the laſt was yelded me for naught.And for the Duke of Bretaines brother Arthur,Both Earle of Rychmond and of Yuery,Againſt his oth from vs had made departure,To Charles the Dolphin our chiefe enemie,I wih the Regent went to Normandie:To take his towne of Yuery which of ſpight,Did to vs dayly al the harme they might.They at the firſt compounded by a dayeTo yeld, if reſcues did not come before,And while in hope to fight we at it laye,The Dolphin gathered men two thouſand ſkore,With Earles, Lordes, and Captaynes ioly ſtore,Of which the Duke of Alanſon was guyde,And ſent them downe to ſee if we would byde.But they left vs and downe to Vernoyle went,And made their vaunt they had our armye ſlayne,And through that lye the towne from vs they hent,Which ſhortly after turned to their payne:For there both armies met vpon the playne:And we eight thouſand whom they flew, not ſlew before,Did kil of them ten thouſand men and more.When wee had taken Vernoyle thus agayne,To driue the Dolphin vtterly out of Fraunce,The Regent ſent me to Aniow and to Mayne,Where I beſieged the warlike towne of MaunsThere Lord of Toyſers Baldwines valiaunceDid wel appeare, which would not yeld the towne,Tyl al the Towers and walles were battred downe.But here now Baldwin take it in good part,Though that I brought this Baldwin there to yeld,The Lyon fierce for all his noble hart,Being ouermatched, is forſt to flye the field,If Mars himſelfe there had bene with his ſhield,And in my ſtormes had ſtoutly me with ſtoed,He ſhould haue yeld, or els haue ſhed my bloud.This worthy knight both hardy ſtout and wyſe,Wrought wel his feate, as time and place require,When Fortune fayles, it is the beſt aduiſeTo ſtryke the ſayle leaſt all lye in the myre,This haue I ſayde to thend thou take no ire:For though no cauſe be found, ſo nature frames,Men haue a zeale to ſuch as beare their names.But to returne, in Mayne wan I at length,Such townes and Fortes as might eyther helpe or hurt,I manned Mayon, and Suzans towne of ſtrength,Fore Barnard, Thanceaur, and S. Cales the curt,With Lile, ſues, Bolton, ſtanding in the durt:Eke Guerland, Suze, Loupeland, and Mountſure,With Malicorne, theſe wanne I and kept ful ſure.Beſides all this I tooke nere fourtie holdes,But thoſe I razed euen with the ground,And for theſe deedes, as ſeely ſheepe in foldes,Do ſhrinke for feare at euery little ſound,So fled my foes before my face ful round:Was none ſo hardy that durſt abyde my fight,So Mars and Fortune furthered me their knight.I tel no lye ſo gaſtful grew my name,That it alone diſcomfited an hoaſt,The Scots and Frenchmen wel confeſſe the ſame,Els wil the towne which they like Cowardes loſt,For whan they ſieged Beauron with great boaſt:Being fourty thouſand Brytaynes, French and Scots,Fiue hundred men did vanquiſh them like ſots.For while the Frenchmen freſhlye aſſaulted ſtil,Our Engliſh men came boldly foorth at night,Cryinge S. George, Saliſburye, kyl, kyl, kyl,And offced freſhlye with their foes to fight,And they as frenchly tooke themſelues to flight,Suppoſing ſurely that I had beene there,See how my name did puthem al in feare.Thus was the Dolphins power diſcomfited,Fowre thouſand ſlaine, their Campe tane as it ſtoode,Whereby our Towne and ſouldiers proficed,For there were vitailes plenteous and good,This while was I in England by the Roode,To appeaſe a ſtrife that was right foule befall,Betwene Duke Humfrey and the Cardinal.The Duke of Exceſter ſhortly after dyed,Which of the King at home had gouernaunce.Whoſe roume the Earle of Warwicke then ſupplyed,And I tooke his and ſped me into Fraunce,And hauing zeale to conquere Orliaunce,With much a do I gat the Regentes ayde,And marched thyther, and ſiege about it layde.But in the way I tooke the towne of Yane,Where murthered were for ſtoutneſſe many a man:But Baugencey I tooke with little payne.For which to ſhew them fauour I began:This cauſed the townes of Mewne and Iargeman,That ſtoode on Loyer: to profer me the keyes,Ere I came nere them, welny by two dayes.See here how Fortune forward can allure,What Baytes ſhe layeth to bring men to their endesWho hauing hap like this, but hopeth ſure,To bring to ale what euer hee entendes?But ſone is ſower the ſweete that fortune ſendes:Whan hope and hap, whan health and wealth is hieſtThen woe and wracke, diſeaſe, and neede be nyeſt.For while I, ſuing this ſo good ſucceſſe,Layde ſiege to Orliaunce on the Riuer ſide,The Baſtard (Cuckold Cawnies ſonne I geſſe,Tho thought the Dukes) who had the towne in guydeCame fiercely foorth, when hee his time eſpyed,To rayſe the ſiege but was bet backe agayne,And hard purſued both to his loſſe and payne.For there we wan the Bulworke on the Bridge,With a mighty tower ſtanding faſt thereby.Ah curſed tower that didſt my dayes abridge,Would God thou hadſt bene furder eyther I:For in this tower a chamber ſtandes on hye,From which a man may view through all the towneBy certain wyndowes iron grated downe.Where on a daye, now Baldwin note myne ende,I ſtoode in viewing where the towne was weake,And as I buſilye talked with my frend,Shot fro the towne, which al the Grate did breake,A pellet came and droue a mighty fleakeAgainſt my face, and care away my cheeke,For payne whereof I dyed within a weeke.See Baldwin ſee the vncertayne glorye,How ſodaine miſchiefe daſheth all to duſt,And warne al Princes by my broken ſtorye,The bappieſt Fortune chieflye to miſtruſt,Was neuer man that alway had his luſt:Than ſacb be fooles, in fancy more then mad,Which hope to haue that neuer any had.FINIS.
THis ſtraunge aduenture of the good earle draue vs al into a dumpe, inwardly lamē ting his woful deſtenye, out of which wee were awaked after this ſort.

To what ende (ſaid one) muſe wee ſo much on the matter. This Earle is neither the fyrſte nor laſte whom fortune hath foundred in the height of their proſperity. For al through the raigne of this vnfortunate kinge Henrye, wee ſhal fynde many which haue been likewiſe ſerued, whoſe chances ſith they be martial, & therfore honorable, may the better bee omitted. And therefore we will let go the Lordes Molines, and Poyninges, ſlayne both at the ſiege of Orleaunce, ſhortly after the death of this Earle. Alſo the valiaunt Earle of Arundel deſtroied with a bowlet at the aſſault of Gerborye, whoſe ſtories neuertheleſſe are worth the hearing. And to quickē  vp your ſpirites, I wil take vpon me a tragical perſon in deede, I meane kinge Iamy ſlayne by his ſeruauntes in his priuy Chamber: who although he be a Scot, yet ſeeing he was brought vp in England, where hee learned the language, his example alſo ſo notable, it were not meete it ſhould be forgotten. And therefore marke Baldwyn what I thinke hee may ſay. *⁎*

# HOW KING IAMES THE firſt for breaking his othes and bonds was by Gods ſufferaunce miſerably murdered of his owne Subiectes. Anno. 1437.
IF for examples ſake thou wrote thy Booke,I chardge thee Baldwin thou forget mee not,Whom fortune alwayes frowardly forſooke.Sutch was my lucke, my merite or my lot.I am that Iames King Roberts Sonne the Scot,That was in England Priſoner all his youth,Through mine vncle Walters trayterous vntruth.For whan my Father through diſeaſe and age,Vnwieldy was to gouerne well his Land,Bycauſe his Brother Walter ſeemed ſage,Hee put the rule thereof into his hand.Than had my Father, you ſhall vnderſtand,Of lawfull Barnes, mee and one onely other,Nempt Dauy Rothſay, who was mine elder Brother.This Dauy was Prince of Scotland and ſo take,Till his aduoutry cauſed men complayne:VVhich that hee might by moniſhment forſake,My Father prayed myne Vncle take the payne.To threaten him his vices to refrayne.But hee falſe Traytour butcherly murderinge wretch,To get the Crowne began to fetch a fetch,And fynding now a proffer to his praye,Deuiſed meanes my brother to deuour,And for that cauſe conuayed him day by dayFrom place to place, from Caſtel vnto tower,To Faulkland fort, where like a tormentourHe ſtarued him, and put to death a wyfe,Whom through a Reede he ſuckt to ſaue his lyfe.O wretched death, fye cruell tyrannye,A Prince in priſon loſt for fault of foode:Was neuer enmie wrought ſuch vilany,A truſty brother deſtroy his brothers blood,VVo worth ſo frendlye, fye on double hood,Ah wretched father ſee thy ſoone is loſt,Sterued by thy brother whom thou truſtedſt moſt.Of whom when ſome began to fynde the fraud,And yet the traytour made himſelfe ſo cleare,That he ſhould ſeeme to haue deſerued laud,So woful did he for his Prince appeare,My doubtful father louing me ful deare.To auoyde all daunger that might after chaunce,Sent mee away but nyne yeares old to Fraunce.But windes and weather were ſo contrary,That we were driuen to thengliſh coaſt,Which Realme with Scotland at that time did varye,So that they tooke me as priſoner not as hoaſt:For which my father fearing I was loſt,Conceiued ſhortlye ſuch an inward thought,As to the graue immediatly him brought,Than had myne vncle all the regimentAt home, and I in England priſoner lay.For to himſelfe he thought it detriment,For my releaſe any raunſome for to pay,For as hee thought he had poſſeſt his pray:And therfore wiſht I might in duraunce dure,Til I had dyed, ſo ſhould his raigne be ſure.But good king Henrye ſeeing I was a childe,And heir by right vnto a realme and crowne,Did bring mee vp not (like my brother) wyloe,But vertuouſlye in feates of high renowne?In I beral artes, in inſtrumental ſowne:By meane whereof when I was after king,I did my realme to ciuel order bring.For ere I had been priſoner eightene yeare,In which ſhort ſpace two noble Princes dyed,Whereof the firſt in prudence had no peere,The other in warre moſt valiaunt throughly tryed,Whoſe roume his ſonne babe Henry eke ſupplied:The peeres of England which did gouerne all,Did of their goodneſſe helpe me out of thrall.They maryed me to a coſin of their king,The Duke of Somerſets daughter rich and fayre,Relcaſt my raunſome ſaue a trifling thing:And after I had done homage to the heyre,And ſworne my frendſhip neuer ſhould appayre,They brought me kingly furniſht to my land,Which I receiued at myne vncles hand.Whereof my Lordes and commons were ful glad,So was mine vncle chieflye as he ſayed,Who in his mouth no other matter had,Saue puniſh ſuch as hab my brother trayed:The fault whereof apparauntly he layed,To good Duke Murdo, his elder brothers ſonne,Whoſe father dyed long ere this was done.My curſed vncle ſlyer than the ſnake,Which would by craft vnto the crowne aſpire,Becauſe be ſaw this Murdo was a ſtake,That ſtayed vp the top of his deſire.(For his elder brother was Duke Murdoes ſyre)He thought it beſt to haue him made away,So was he ſure (I gone) to haue his praye.And by his craftes the traytour brought to paſſe,That I deſtroyed Duke Murdo and his kin,Poore innocentes, my louing frendes alas.O Kinges and Princes what plight ſtand we in,A truſted traytour ſhal you quickly win,To put to death your kin and frendes moſt iuſt,Take heede therfore, take heede whoſe reede ye truſt.And at the laſt to bring me hole in hate,With God and man at home and eke abrode,He counſaild me for ſuraunce of my ſtate:To helpe the Frenchmen, then nigh ouertrodeBy Engliſhmen: and more to lay on lede,With power and force al England comude,Againſt the oth and homage that I made.And though at fyrſt my conſcience dyd grudge,To breake the boundes of frendſhip knit by othYet after proafe (ſee miſchiefe) I did iudge,Iemadneſſe for a king to keepe his troth,And ſemblably with al the world it goth:Synnes oft aſſayed are thought to be no ſinne,So ſoyleth ſinne the ſoule it ſinketh in.But as diſeaſes common cauſe of death,Bring daunger moſt, when leaſt they pricke and ſmart,Which is a ſigne they haue expulſt the breathOf liuely heate which doth defend the hart:Euen ſo ſuch ſinnes as felt are on no partHaue conquered grace, and by their wicked bre,So kild the ſoule that it can haue no cure.And grace agate, vyce ſtil ſuccedeth vyce,And al to haſt the vengeaunce for the furſt,I areade therfore al people to be wiſe,And ſtop the bracke when it beginnes to burſt,Attaſt no poyſon (vice is veuim worſt,It mates the mynde) beware eke of to much,Al kyl through muchneſſe, ſome with onely touch.When I had learnde to ſet my oth at nought,And through much vſe the ſence of ſinne exiled.Againſt King Henry what I could I wrought,My fayth my oth vniuſtly fowle defiled,And while ſlye Fortune at my doinges ſmyled,The wrath of God which I had wel deſerued,Fel on my necke, for thus loe was I ſerued.Ere I had raygned fully fiftene yeare,While tyme I lay at Pertho at my placeWith the Quene my wyfe and children me to cheareMy murdrynge vncle with the double face,That longed for my kyngdome and my mace,To ſlay me there ſuborned Robert Grame,With whom his nephue, Robert ſtuart came.And when their tyme fit for their purpoſe found,Into my priuy chamber they aſtart,Wherwith their ſwoordes they gaue me many a wound,And ſlue al ſuch as ſtuck vnto my partThere loe my wife did ſhew her louing hart,Who to defend me felied one or twayne.And was ſore wounded ere I could be ſlayne.See Baldwin, Baldwin, the vnhappy endes,Of ſuch as paſſe not for theyr lauful othOf thoſe that cauſeles leaue their fayth or frendesAnd murdre kinſfolkes through their foes vntroth,Warne, warne al princes, al like ſinnes to loth,And chiefly ſuch as in my realme be borneFor god hates highly all

And ſurely thoughe the Cardinal againſt nature was the Dukes mortall Foe, yet the chiefe cauſers of his confuſyon, was ye Quene, and William Delapoole Ele of Suffolke and afterwards Duke, whoſe counſel was chefely followed in the contryuing of this noble mans deſtruction, She through ambicion to haue ſoueraynty and rule and he through, flattery to purchace honour and promotion, which as he in ſhorte time obtayned: ſo in as ſhort tyme he loſt agayne, & his life withal by the iuſt iudgement of God, receiuing ſuch meaſure as he before mette to this good Prince. This drift of his turned to the vtter euerthrow of the king himſelfe, the Quene his wife, & Edward their ſon a moſt goodly prince, & to the ſubuerſion of the hole houſe Of Lancaſter, as you may ſee at large in the Chronicles: but now let vs heare what the Duke will ſaye.

wil hardly be diſplaſtOut of hyghe hartes, and namely where debate,Happeneth amongſt great perſons of eſtate,For like as a match deth lye and ſmolder,Long time before it commeth to the trayne.But yet when fyre hath caught in the poulder,No arte is able, the flames to reſtrayne:Euen ſo the ſparkes of enuye and diſdayne,Out of the ſmoke burſt foorth in ſuch a flame,That Fraunce and England yet may rue the ſame.So when of two realmes the regiment royal,Betwene brothers was parced equallye,One placed in Fraunce for affayres Martiall,And I at home for ciuil pollicie:To ſerue the ſtate, we both did ſo applie,As honour and fame to both did encreaſe,To him for the warre, to me for the peace.Whence enuye ſprang, and ſpecially becauſeThis proude prelate could not abyde a Peere,Within the land to rule the ſtate by lawes,Wherfore lifting my lyfe and actes moſt neere,He neuer ceaſt, vntil as you ſhal beare,By practiſe foule of him and his allies,My death was wrought in moſt vnworthy wiſe.And fyrſt he ſought my doinges to defame,By rumours falſe, which hee and his did ſoweLetters and hylles to my reproch and ſhameHe did deuiſe, and al about beſtow,Whereby my troch in doubt ſhould dayly agow,In England fyrſt and afterward in Fraunce,Mouing al meanes to bring me to miſchaunce.One quarel was, that where by common lawMurder and theft beene puniſht all alike,So as manſlears, which bloudy blades do drawe,Suffer no more, then he that doth but pike,Me thought the ſame no order politike,In ſetting paynes to make no difference,Betweene the leſſer and greater offence.I beeing ſeene ſomwhat in ciuil law,The rules thereof reputed muche better,Wherfore to keepe, offenders more in awe,Like as the fault was ſmaller or greater,So ſet I paynes more eaſier or bitter,Waying the qualitie of euerye offence,And ſo according pronounced ſentence,Amongſt my other Delicta Iuuentutis,Whilſt rage of youth my reaſon did ſubdue,I muſt confeſſe as the very truth is,Driuen by deſire, fond fancies to enſue,A thing I did, whereof great trouble grew,Abuſing one to my no ſmall rebuke,VVhich wife was than to Iohn of Brabant Duke.Called ſhe was Lady Iaquet the fayre,Delightful in loue like Helene of Troye:To the Duke of Bauier ſole daughter and heire,Her did I marrye to my great annoyYet for a tyme, this dame I did enioye,VVith her whole landes, witholding them by force,Til, Martin the Pope, betwene vs made diuorce.Yet all theſe blaſtes not hable were to moueThe anchor ſtrong, whereby my ſhip did ſtay,Some other ſhift to ſeeke him did behoue,Whereto ere long il fortune made the way,Which fynally was cauſe of my decayAnd cruel death, contriued by my foes,Which fel out thus, as now I ſhal diſcloſe.Elianor my wife, my Dutches only deare,I know not how but as the nature isOf women al, aye carious to enquiereOf thinges to came (though I confeſſe in thisHer fault not ſmall) and that ſhee did an iſſe,By wytches ſkill, which ſorcery ſome call,Would know of thinges which after ſhould befall.And for that cauſe made her ſelfe acquaintedWith mother Madge, called the wytch of Eye,And with a Clerke that after was attaited,Bolenbroke he hight, that learned was that way,With other moe, which famous were that daye,Aſwel in Science, called Mathematicall,As alſo in magicke and ſkil ſupernaturalTheſe cunning folkes ſhe ſet on worke to know,The time how long the king ſhould liue and raigne,Same by the Starres, and ſome by deuils below,Some by witchcraft ſought knowledge to attayne,VVith like fancies, friuolous fond and vayne,Whereof though I knew leaſt of any man,Yet by that meane my miſchiefe firſt began.Yet beſides this there was a greater thing,How ſhe in waxe by counſel of the witch,An Image made, crowned like a king,VVith ſword in hand, in ſhape and likeneſſe ſycheAs was the kinge, which dayly they did pytchAgainſt a fyre, that as the waxe did melt,So ſhould his lyfe conſume away vnfelt.My Dutcheſſe thus, accuſed of this cryme,As ſhe that ſhould ſuch practiſe firſt beginne,My part was then to yeld vnto the time,Geeuing her leaue, to deale alone thereinAnd ſince the cauſe concerned deadly ſynne,Which to the clergie onely doth perteine,To deale therein I plainly did refrayne.And ſuffered them her perſon to aſciteInto their Courtes, to aunſwere and appeare,Which to my hart was ſure the greateſt ſpight,That cauld be wrought, and touched me moſt neare,To ſee my wife, and lady leefe and deare,To my reproche, and plaine before my face,Entreated ſe, as one of ſorte moſt baſe.The clergie then examining her cauſe,Conuinced her, as guiltie in the ſame,And ſentence gaue according to their lawes,That ſhe and they whom I before did nameShould ſuffer death, or els ſome open ſhame:Of which penaunce my wife by ſentence hadTo ſuffer ſhame of both the two, more bad.And fyrſt ſhe muſt by dayes together three,Through London ſtreetes paſſe a, along in ſightBare legde and barefoote, that al the world might ſee,Bearing in hand a burning taper bright,And not content, with this extreeme deſpight,To worke mee wo, in al they may or can,Exilde ſhe was into the Ile of Man.This haynous crime and open worldly ſhame,With ſuch rigour ſhewed vnto my wife,Was a fyne fetch further thinges to frame,And nothing els, but a preparatiueFirſt from office, and fynally from lyfe,Me to depriue, and ſo paſſing further,What law could not, to execute by murther.Which by ſlye driftes, and wyndlaces aloofe,They brought about, perſwading firſt the Queene,That in effect it was the kinges reproofe,And hers alſo, to be exempted cleane,From princely rule, or that it ſhould be ſeeneA king of yeares, ſtil gouerned to beeLyke a Pupil, that nothing could forſee.The daunger more conſidering the kingWas without childe, I being his next heire,To rule the realme, as Prince in

of Yorke, and other of his bloud,With Neuils all, knyt were then together.And Delapoole, frend afore to neither:The Cardinal alſo, came within this liſt,As Herode and Pylate, to iudge Ieſu Chriſt.This

frendes moſt plainlye did detect,The ſubtil traine, and practiſe of al thoſe,VVhich againſt mee, great treaſons did ſuppoſe,Yet truſt of truth with a conſcience cleare,Gaue me good hart, in that place to appeare.Vpon which truſt with more haſt then good ſpeede,Forward I went to that vnluckye place,Dutie to ſhow, and no whit was in dreadeOf any trayne, but bold to ſhew my face,As a true man yet ſo fel out the caſe,That after traueyle, ſeeking for repoſe,An armed hand, my lodging did encloſe.The Vicount Beaumount, who for the time ſupplied,The office of high Coneſtable of the LandWas with the Queene and Cardinall allied,By whoſe ſupport, he ſtoutlye tooke in hand,My lodginge to enter with an armed handAnd for high treaſon, my perſon did areſt,And layed me that night, where him ſeemed heſtThen ſhaking and quaking, for dread of a Dreame,Halfe waked al naked in bed as I ſay,What tyme ſtrake the chime of mine hower extreame,Oppreſt was my reſt with mortal affray,My foes did vncloſe, I know not which wayMy chamber dores, and boldly they in brake,And had me faſt before I could awake.Thou lookeſt now, that of my ſecret murther,I ſhould at large the maner how declare,I pray thee Baldwin, aſke of me no further,For ſpeaking playne, it came ſo at vnware,As I my ſelfe, which caught was in the ſnare,Scarcely am able the circumſtaunce to ſhew,Which was kept cloſe, and knowen but vnto few.But be thou ſure by violence it was,And o whit bred by ſickeneſſe or diſeaſe,That felt it well before my life did paſſe,For when theſe wolues, my bodie once did ceaſe,Vſed I was, but ſmally to myne eaſe:With tormentes ſtrong, which went ſo nerethe quicke,As made me dye before that I was ſicke.A Palſey (they ſayd) my vital ſprites oppreſt,Bred by exceſſe of melancholie blacke,This for excuſe to lay, them ſeemed beſt,Leaſt my true frendes the cauſe might further racke,And ſo perhaps diſcouer the whoole packe,Of the conſpyrers, whom they might wel ſuſpect,For cauſes great, which after tooke effect.Dead was I found, by ſuch as beſt did know,The maner how the ſame was brought to paſſe.And than my corps, was ſet out for a ſhow,By view whereof, nothing perceiued was:Whereby the world may ſee as in a glaſſe,The vnſure ſtate, of them that ſtand moſt hye,Which than bread leaſt, when daunger is moſt nye.And alſo ſee, what daunger they lyu in,Which next their king are to ſuccede in place:Since kinges moſt parte, be Ielous of their kynne,Whom I aduiſe, fore warned by my caſe,To beare low ſayle, and not to much embrace,The peoples loue: for as Senec ſayth trulye:O  quam

THe good Duke hauing ended his wofll tragedye, after much talke had concerning diſcention among theſe that be magiſtrates, good Lord (quoth one) what miſchief and deſtruction doth priuye grudge and mallice, rayſe among all ſortes of people, both hye and low? but eſpeciallye among Magiſtrats bng ye head and guyde of the Common wealth: for what miſchiefe did the diſcention betweene theſe two perſons  (being both of high eſtate) bring afterward to both the realmes: yea and the vtter ruine of moſt part of them that were the chiefe workers of this Dukes death, you ſaye troth (quoth I) and now for that, it I may craue your pacience awhile, you ſhal heare what I haue noted in y• Duke of Suffolkes doinges, one of the chiefe procurours of Duke Humfreyes deſtruction, who by the prouidence of God came ſhortly after in ſuch hatred of ye people, that the king himſelfe could not ſaue him frō a ſtraunge and notable death. For beeing baniſht the realme for the terme of fyue yeares, to appraſe the continual rumours and inward grudges, that not onely the commons, but moſt part of the nobilitie of England, bare towardes him for the death of the ſayde Duke, he ſaylinge towardes Fraunce was met with a ſhippe of Deuonſhire, and beheaded forthwith the fyrſt day of Maye, Anno 1450. And the dead corps throwen vp at Douer vpon the ſandes, which may lament his death after this maner.

# HOWE VVILLIAM DELApoole Duke of Suffolke was worthelye baniſhed for abuſing his kinge, and procuringe the death of Duke Humfrey of Gloceſter, protector of England. Anno. 1450.
HEauye is the hap whereto all men be bound,I meane the death, which no eſtate may flye:But to be baniſht, beheaded and than dround,In ſincke of ſhame from top of honours hye,Was neuer man, ſo ſeru'd I thinke but I,Wherfore good Baldwin amongſt the reſt by right,I clayme of thee my woful caſe to wryte.My onely lyfe in all ponintes may ſuffice,To ſhew how baſe al baytes of Fortune be,Which thawe lyke Iſe, through heate of enuies eyes:Or vicious deedes which much poſſeſſed mee:Good hap with vice, long tyme cannot agree,Which bring beſt Fortunes to the baſeſt fall,And happieſt hap, to enuy to be thrall.Called I was William Delapoole,Of Suffolke Duke in Queene Margarets dayes,That found the meane Duke Humfreyes bloud to coole,Whoſe worthy acts deſerue eternal prayſe,Whereby I note that Fortune cannot rayſeAny one al oft, without ſome others wracke,Fluds drowne no fieldes, before they fynde a bracke.But as the waters which do breake the wallesDo loſe their courſe, they had within the ſhore,And daylye rotting ſtincke within their ſtalles,For faule of mouing which they found before:Euen ſo the ſtate that ouer high is bore,Doth looſe the lyfe of Peoples loue it had,And rotts it ſelfe vntil it fall to bad.For while I was but Earle, ech man was glad,To ſaye and do the beſt by me they might:And Fortune euer ſince I was a lad,Did ſmyle vpon me with a cherefull ſight,For whan my king had dubbed me a knight,And ſent me foorth to ſerue at warre in Fraunce,My luckye ſpeede myne honour did enhaunce.Where, to omit the many feates I wroughtVnder others guyde, I doe remember one,Which with my ſouldiers valiauntly was fought,None other Capitayne ſaue my ſelfe alone,I meane not now the apprinze of Pucel IoneIn which attempt my trauayle was not ſmall,Though the Duke of Bourbon had the prayſe of al.But the ſiege of Awmarle is the feate I prayſe,A ſtrōg built town, with caſtles, walles, & vaultes,With men and weapon armde at all aſſayes:To which I gaue nigh fyue times fiue aſſaultes,Til at the laſt they yelded it for naughts,Yet Lord Ramburs like a valiaunt knight,Defended it as long as ere he mightBut what preuayled it theſe Townes to win,VVhich ſhortly after muſt be loſt agayne?VVhereby I ſee there is more glory inThe keepinge thinges than is in their attayne:To get and keepe not, is but loſſe of payne.Therefore ought men prouide to ſaue their winningesIn all attemptes, els loſe they their beginninges.Becauſe we could not keepe the Townes wee won,For they were more than we might eaſely wyeldOne yeare vndid what wee in ten had don:For enuy at home, and treaſon abroade, did yeldeKinge Charles his realme of Fraunce, made barrain field:For bloudy warres had waſted all encreaſe,VVhich cauſde the Pope helpe pouerty ſue for peace.So that in Tourayn, at the towne of TouresDuke Charles, and other for their Prince appered,So did Lord Roſſe, and I than Earle, for oures:And whan we ſhewed wherein ech other dered,VVe ſought out meanes al Quarels to haue clered,VVherein the Lordes of Germany, of Spayne,Of Hungary, and Denmarke, tooke exceedinge payne.But ſith wee coulde no finall peace induce,For neyther would the others couenaūtes here,For Eighteene monethes wee did conclude a truce:And while as frendes wee lay together there,Becauſe my Warrant did mee therein beare,To make a perfite peace, and through accord,I ſought a mariage for my Soueraygne Lord.And for the French Kinges Daughters were to ſmall,A fancied moſt Dame Margaret his Niece,A louely Lady, Bewtifull, and Tall,Faire ſpoken, pleaſaunt, a very Princely piece,In Wit, and learninge, matchleſſe hence to Greece,Duke Rayners Daughter of Antow, Kinge by ſtileOf Naples, Ieruſalem, and of Scycill Ile.But ere I could the graunt of her attayne:All that our Kinge had of her fathers landes,As Mountes the City, the county whole of Mayne,And moſt of Aiow Ducy in our handes,I did releaſe him by aſſured handes.And as for Dowry with her none I ſought,I thought no peace could be to derely bought.But whan this mariage throughly was agreedAlthough my kinge were glad of ſutch a makeHis Vncle Humfrey abhorred it in deede,Becauſe thereby his precontract he brake,Made with the heyre of the Earle of Arminacke,A noble Mayde with ſtore of goods endowed,VVhich more than this with loſſe, the Duke allowed.But loue, and bewty in the kinge ſo wrought,That neither profit, or promiſe hee regarded,But ſet his vncles counſayle ſtill at nought:And for my gaynes, I highly was awarded.Thus vertue ſtarues, but luſt foode muſt bee larded,For I made Marquiſe, went to Fraunce agayne,And brought this Bryde vnto my Soueraygne.At whom becauſe Duke Humfrey ay repined.Calling their mariage aduoutrie (as it was)The Queene did moue me, erſt thereto enclyned,To helpe to bring him to his Requiem maſſe,Which ſith it could for no crime come to paſſe:His lyfe and doinges were ſo right and cleare,Through priuy murther we brought him to his Beere.Thus righteouſneſſe brought Humfrey to rebuke,Becauſe he ſhould no wickedneſſe allow,But for my doinges I was made a Duke.So Fortune can both bend and ſmoth her browOn whom ſhe liſt, not paſſing why or how.O Lord how high, how ſoone ſhe did me rayſe,How faſt ſhe fildime both with prayes and prayſe.The Lordes and Commons both of like aſſent,Be ſought my ſoueraigne kneeling on their knees,To recorde my doinges in the Parliament,As deedes deſeruing euerlaſting fees,In which attempt they did no labour leeſe,For they ſet not my prayſe ſo faſt in flame,As hee was redy to reward the ſame.But note the end, my deedes ſo worthy deemedOf King, of Lordes, and Commons altogether,Were ſhortlye after treaſons falſe eſteemed,And all men curſt Queene Margets comming hyther,For Charles the French king in his feaces not lither,Whan we had rendered Rayner, Maunts, and Mayne,Found meanes to wynne al Normandy againe.This made the Peopie curſe the mariage,Eſteeming it the cauſe of euery loſſe:Wherfore at mee with open mouth they rage,Affirming me to haue brought the realme to moſſeWhan King and Queene ſaw things thus go a croſſeTo quiet al a Parliament they called,And cauſed mee in Priſon to be thralled.And ſhortlye after brought me foorth abroade,VVhich made the commons more than double woodAnd ſome with weapons would haue layd on loade,If their graund Captaine Blewberd in his moode,Had not in time with wiſedome bene withſtode:But though that he and more were executed,The people ſtil their worſt againſt me bruted.And ſo applied the Parliament with Bylles,Of haynous wronges and open trayterous crimes,The king and Queene were forſt againſt their willesFro place to place to adiourne it diuers times.For Princes power is like the ſandy ſlymes,VVhich muſt perforce geeue place vnto the waue,Or ſue the windye ſourges when they raue.Their lyfe was not more deare to them than I,VVhich made them ſearch al ſhiftes to ſaue me ſtil,But aye my foes ſuch faultes did on me trye,That to preſerue me from a worſer ill,The king was fayue ful ſore againſt his wyl:For fyue yeares ſpace to ſend me in exile,In hope to haue reſtorde me in a while.But marke howe vengeaunce wayteth vpon vice,To ſhun this ſtorme, in ſaylinge towardes Fraunce,A Pirates Barke, that was of little price,Encounted mee vppon the Seas by chaunce,VVhoſe Captayne there tooke mee as in a traunce,Let paſſ my ſhippes, with all their frait, and loade,And led mee backe agayne to Douer roade.VVere, vnto me recountinge all my faultes,As murdringe of Duke Humfrey in his Bed,And how I, had brought all the Realme to naughtes,Cauſing the Kinge vnlawfully to wed,Thee was no grace, but I muſt looſe my head,VVherefore he made me to ſhriue me in his boate,And on the brinke, my Necke in two he ſmoate.This was myne ende: which was by reaſon dueTo me, and ſutch as others deaths procure.Therefore be bold to write, for it is true,That who ſo doth ſutch practiſe put in vre,Of due reward at laſt ſhalbe moſt ſure,For God is iuſt, whoſe ſtroke delayed longe,Doth light at laſt, with payne more ſharpe and ſtronge.FINIS.VV.

VVHan this was ſayd: euery man reioſed to heare of a wicked perſon ſo righteouſly puniſhed: for though fortune in many points be iniurious to Princes, yet in this & ſutch lyk ſhee is moſt righteous: and only deſerueth the name of  a goddeſſe, whan ſhe prouideth meanes to puniſh & deſtroy tyrantes. And when we had a while conſidered the driftes of the Kinge & Queene to haue ſaued this duke: & yet they could not: It is worth ye labour (ſayd one) to way the workes, & iudgemēts of God: which ſeinge they are knowen moſt euidently by comparing contraries, I will touch the ſtory of Iacke Cade in order next following.

Whom Kinge Henry with all his puiſſaunce was no more able for a while to deſtroy (yet was he hys rebellious enemy) thā he was to preſerue the Duke of Suffolke his dereſt frend: by which two examples doth appeare how notably God diſpoſeth all thinges, and that no force ſtretcheth father, than it pleaſeth him to ſuffer. For this Cade beinge an Iriſheman, but of meane parentage, of no ability, & leſſe power, accompanied with a fewe naked Kentiſh mē, cauſed the king with his army at al points appointed, to leaue the fielde, and ſuffer him to doe whatſoeuer he luſted for a tyme, but in the ende he was ſlaine at Hothfield in Suffer, and caried thēce to London in a Cart, & there quartered. In whoſe behalfe, ſeeinge hee is one of Fortunes Whelpes, I will trouble you a while to heare the proceſſe of his enterpriſe, which hee may declare in maner followinge.

# HOW IACKE CADE NAminge himſelfe Mortimer, trayterouſly rebellinge agaynſt his Kinge in Iune. Anno. 1450. was for his treaſons, and cruell doinges worthely puniſhed.
SHall I call it Fortune or my frowardfolly,That lifte mee vp, and layd mee downe belowe?Or was it Courage, that made me ſo Ioly.Or ſtrēgth of ſtars, wt make men high to growe?What euer it were this one poynct ſuer I know,Which ſhalbe meete for euery man to marke.Our luſt and willes, our euils chiefly warke.It may be well that planets do encline,And our complexions moue our mindes to ill,But ſutch is reaſon, that they bringe to fineNo worke vnayded of our luſt, and will:For Heauen, and Earth are ſubiect both to ſkill.The ſkyll of God ruleth all it is ſo ſtronge,Man may by ſkill guyde thinges that to him longe.Though luſt be ſturdy, and will enclinde to nought,This forſt by mixture that by Heauens courſe,Yet through the ſkill, God hath in reaſon wroughtAnd geuen man, no luſt nor will to courſe,But may be ſtayed, or ſwaged of the ſourſe,So that it ſhall in nothing force the mynde:To worke our wo, or leaue the proper kynde.But though this ſkill bee geuen to euery manTo rule the will, and kepe the minde aloft,For acke of grace full fewe vſe it can.Theſe wordly pleaſures tickle vs ſo oft:Skull is not weake, but will ſtrong, fleſh is ſoftAnd yeldes it ſelfe to pleaſure that it loue to.And ales the mynde to that it moſt reproueth.Now if this hap whereby we yelde our myndeTo luſt, and will, be Fortune as we name her,Than is ſhe iuſtly called falſe, and blinde,And no reproch can be to mutch to blame her:Yet is the ſhame our owne when ſo we ſhame her,For ſer this hap if it be rightly known,Commeth of our ſelues, and ſo the blame our own.For who ſo liueth in the Schole of ſkill,And medeth not with any worlds affaires,Forſaketh Pompes, and honours, that do ſpillThe mindes recourſe to Graces quiet ſtyres,His ſtate no Fortune by no meane apayres:For Fortune is the folly, and plague of thoſeVVhich to the World their wretched willes diſpoſe.Amonge which Fooles (marke Baldwyn) I am one,That would not ſtay my ſelfe in mine eſtate.I thought to rule, but would obay to none,Wherefore I thought to be my Princes mate,And by ſome meane his power to abate,And for that ends, Mortimer would be nam'de,Heyre apparant, of England once proclaym'de.This ſhift I vſed the people to perſwadeTo leaue their Prince, and on my ſyde to ſticke.Whereas in deede, my fathers name was Cade.Whoſe noble ſtocke was neuer worth a ſticke.But touching wit I was both rype and quicke.Had ſtrength of Luns, large ſtature, comely face,Which made men wene my lignage were not baſe.And ſeeing ſtoutneſſe ſtucke by men in Kent,Whoſe valiaunt hartes refuſe none enterpriſe,With falſe perſwaſions ſtraite to them I went,And ſaye they ſuffred too great iniuries:By meane where of I cauſed them to ryſe,And Battaile wiſe to come to Blackheath playne,And thence their griefes vnto the king complayne.Who being deafe (as men ſay) on that eareFor we deſired releaſe of ſubſedies,Refuſed roughly our requeſtes to heare,And came againſt vs as our enemies:But we to tary ſought our ſubtilities,Remoued our campe, and backe to Senocke went,After whom the Staffordes with their power waSee here how Fortune ſetting vs aflote,Brought to our nets a Porcion of our pray.For why the Sea ordes with their armie hote,Aſſailed vs at Senocke where we laye:From whence aliue they parted not awaye,Which wan the kinges retinue vnderſtoode,They all affirmde my quarel to be good.Which cauſed the King and Queene whom all did hate,To rayſe their Campe, and ſodenly depart:And that they might the Peoples grudge abate,To impriſon ſome ful ſore againſt their hart.Lord Saye was one, whom I made after ſmart,For after Staffordes and their hoaſt was ſlayne,To Blackheath field I marched backe agayne.And where the King would nothing heare before,Now was he glad to ſend to know my minde:And I thereby enflamed much the more,Refuſed his grauntes ſo folly made me blynde.For this be flew, and left Lord Scales behinde,To helpe the towne and ſtrengthen London tower,Towardes which I marched forward with my power.And found there al thinges at myne owne deſire.I entred London did there what I liſt,The Treaſorer, Lord Saye, I did conſpyreTo haue condempned: whereof whan I miſt,(For hee by law my malice did reſiſt)By force I tooke him i Guildhal fro the heape,And headed him before the Croſſe in Cheape.His Sonne in lawe Iames Cromer ſhriue of KentI caught at Myle end, whereas then he laye:Beheaded him and on a poale I ſent,His head to London where his fathers laye.With theſe two heades I made a prety play,For pight on poales I bore them through the ſtreete,And for my ſport made ech kiſſe other ſweete.Than brake I Priſons ſet forth whom I would,And vſed the city as it had bin myne:Tooke from the Marchauntes, money, ware, and gold.From ſome by force, from other ſome by ſyne.This at the length did cauſe them to repyne,So that Lord Scals, conſentinge with the Mayre,Forbad vs to their City to repayre.For all this while mine hoaſt in Southwarke lay,VVho whan they knew out paſſage was denied,Came boldely to the bridge and made a fray.For in wee would the townes men vs defied:But whan with ſtrokes wee had the matter tried,VVee wan the Bridge and ſet mutch part on ſier,This dane to Southwarke bock we did retier.The morow after came the Chancellour,VVith generall pardon for my men, halfe gone,VVhich heard and read, the reſt within an houre,Shranke all away ech man to ſhift for one.And whan I ſawe they left mee poſt alone,I did diſguiſe me like a knight of the poſt,And into Suſſex rode away in poſte.And there I lurked till that curſed coyne,That reſtleſſe Begle ſought, and found mee out,For ſtraight the Kinge by promiſe did emoyne,A thouſand marke to whoſoeuer moughtApprehend my corſe, which made them ſeeke about:Amonge the which one Alexander Iden,Found out the Hole wherein the Foxe was hidden.But ere hee tooke me, I put him to his Trumps,For yeeld I would not while my handes would holde,But hope of money made him ſtur his ſtumps,And to aſſault mee valiauntly, and bolde.For two longe Howres, our Combat was not coldeTill at the laſt he lent me ſutch a ſtroke,That down I fell, and neuer after ſpoke.Than was my Carkaſſe caried like a Hog.To Southwarkes Borough where it lay a night,The next day drawen to Newgate like a dog,All men reioyſinge at the rufull ſight:Than were on Poales my perboyls Quarters pight,And ſet a loft for Vermin to deuour,Meete graue for Rebels that reſiſt the power.Full litle knowe wee Wretches what wee do,VVhen wee preſume our Princes to reſiſt.VVee Warre with God, againſt his glory to,That placeth

BY ſaint Mary (ſaid one) if Iacke were as wel learned, as you haue made hys oration, whatſoeuer hee was by byrth, I warrante him a Gentilman by his learning. How notablye & philoſopher like hath he deſcribed fortune, & the cauſes of worldlye cumbraunce? how lyke a diuine hath he determined the office both of Magiſtrates and ſubiects For in deede Magiſtrates be Gods deputies, and it is Gods office which they beare: and it is hee whiche ordeyneth thereto ſuch as himſelfe liſteth, good whan he fauoureth the People, and euil when hee wyl puniſh them. And therfore whoſoeuer rebelleth againſt any ruler, eyther good or bad, rebelleth agaynſt God, and ſhal neuer ſee good end of hys attempt: for God cannot but mainteyn his deputie. Yet this I note by the way concerning rebelles & rebellions. Although the deuil rayſe them, yet God alwayes vſeth them to his glorye, as a part of hys iuſtice. For whan kinges & chiefe rulers, ſuffer their  vnder officers to miſuſe their ſubiects, and wil not heare nor remedy their peoples wrongs (whā they complayne) then ſuffereth God the Rebell to rage, and to execute that parte of his Iuſtice, which the parcial prince would not.

For the Lord Saye a very corrupt officer, and one whome notwithſtanding the kinge always maynteyned. was deſtroyed by this Iacke, as was alſo the Biſhop of Saliſburye (a proud and couetous Prelate) by other of the Rebelles. And therefore whatſoeuer prince deſireth to lyue quietly without rebellion muſt doe his ſubiectes right in al thinges and puniſh ſuche Officers as oppreſſe, his People: thus ſhal they be ſure from all Rebellion. And for ye clerer opening hereof, it were wel done to ſet forth this Lord Sayes tragedye. What neede that (ſaid another) ſeeing ye like example is ſeene in the Duke of Suffolke, whoſe doings are declared ſufficientlye alreadye. Nay let vs goe forward for we haue a great many behinde that may not be omitted, & the tyme as you ſee paſſeth away. As for this lord Saye, whome Cade ſo cruellye killed, and ſpitefullye vſed after his Death (I dare ſaye) ſhalbee knowen thereby he was to all that reade or heare this ſtorye. For God would neuer haue ſuffered hym to haue beene ſo vſed, except he had firſt deſerued it.

 Therefore let him go and wyth him the Biſhop, and all other ſlayne in that rebellion which was rayſed by ſome ſly drift of the Duke of Yorke, who ſhortly after by opē War, manifeſted his title to ye crowne, and therefore gathered an army in Wales, & marched towardes London: And preuentinge ye kinge, goinge northward to prepare an army, in the waye at Sayncte Albanes: Who for want of a ſufficient power to take the field, was forced with ſutch ſmal power as he had about him, to defend the Lanes, & backſydes of the towne, and to ſend out the Duke of Buckingham for a treaty, which the Duke of Yorke beinge head of the contrary faction, woulde not allow without fyrſt hauinge the Duke of Somerſet and other at his will, duringe which treaty Richard Neuill Earle of Warwike, the ſtout maintayner of yorckes title entred the Towne by force, fought a Battayle in the high ſtreat, where of the Kinges part were ſlayne the ſayd Duke of Somerſet called Edmond Beauford, Henry Percy the ſecond of that ſurname, Earle of Northumberlande, Humfrey, Earle of Stafford, Sonne and Heyre to Humfrey Duke of Buckingham, Ihon Lord Clifford, Babthorp the Kinges attorney, and his Son and heyre, beſides a great number of Knightes, Eſquiers, Gentlemen, & yeomen of ye kinges houſhold & of other Lordes ſeruauntes, on whō al the ſlaughter,  and bochery fell, beinge all for the more part vnarmed. But becauſe the Duke of Somerſet was the chiefe of the Kinges parte paſſinge ouer the reſt, let vs only heare him ſpeake for all.

SOme I ſuppoſe are borne vnfortunate,Els good endeuours coulde not ſo ill ſucceede,VVhat ſhall I call it? ill fortune or fate,That ſome attempts haue neuer happy ſpeede,But trauayle thankleſſe, al bootleſſe their heede:VVhere other vnlike in workinge, or in ſkill,Wynne what they will, and wield the world at will.Of the firſt ſorte, myſelfe I count for one,To all miſhap, I wene predeſtinate,Beleeue mee Baldwin, there bee few or none,To whom Fortune was euer more ingrate.Make thou therefore my life a Caueat,That who ſo with force wyll worke agaynſt kinde,Sayleth (as who ſayth) agaynſt the ſtremt, and winde.For I of Somerſet which Duke Edmond hight,Extract by diſcent from Lancaſter lyne,VVere it by folly, or Fortunes deſpight,Or by ill aſpect of ſome croked ſigne,Of myne attempts could neuer ſee good fine:VVhat ſo I began did ſeldome well ende:God from ſutch Fortune, all good men defend.Where I ſought to ſaue, moſt part I did ſpill,For good hap with mee was alway at Warre.The Linage of Yorke whom I bare ſo ill,By my ſpight became bright, and ſhone like a Starre,Thus ſome whiles men make, when fayne they would marre.The more yee lop Trees, the greater they grow.The more yee ſtop Streames, the higher they flow.Maugre my ſpighte, his glory grew the more,And mine, as the Moone in the wane, waxt leſteFor hauinge the place which he had before,Gouernour of Fraunce, needes I muſt confeſſe,That loſt was Normandy yet netheleſſe,Alwayes I wrought that wit might well contriue,But what bootes it, againſt the Streame to ſtriue?Borne was I neyther to Warre ne to peace,Mars was maligne, and enemy to my trade:My Birth I beleue was in Ioues decreaſe,When Cancer in courſe, beinge retrograde,Swarued from Sol, vnto Saturnus ſhade,Where aſpectes were good, oppoſites did marre,So grew mine vnhap both in peace, and warre.A ſtraunge Natiuity in calculation,As my liues courſe, did after well declare,Wherof in briefe to make relation,That other by mee may learne to beware,Ouerlight credence was cauſe of my care.And want of foreſight in geuinge aſſent,Humfrey to damme that Duke moſt innocent.Humfrey meane I that was the protectour,Duke of Gloceſter of the royall bloud,So long as he was Englandes directour,Kinge Henries title to the Crowne was good,This worthy Prince, as a Piller longe ſtoad:Or like a ſtrong prop ſet vnder a vyne,In ſtate to vpholde all Lancaſters lyne.O headleſſe truſt, vnware of harme to come,O mad malice where wit obeyeth will,VVas there euer any, whom folly did ſo nome:Of all forecaſt, rigth, reaſon, wit, and ſkill,As mee blinde Bayard conſentinge to ſpillMy Cooſyns bloud, my refuge, and my ſtay,To my deſtruction, makinge open way?So long as he in England bare the ſway,So long Rebelles no Quarelles durſt begin,But when the poſte, was pulled once away,Which ſtoode to vpholde the kinge, and his kin,The Duke of Yorke, than ſtoutly hee ſtept in,And chalenged the Crowne, by color of right,Beginninge with Lawe, and endinge with might.And ſpred great brutes in England vp and downe,That he of England was the heire true,And how Henry had vſurped the CrowneAgainſt all right, by practiſe moſt vntrue:The people than, embraſinge titles newe,Irkeſome of preſent, and longing for chaunge,Aſſenced ſoone, becauſe they loue to raunge.True is the text which wee in Scripture reade,Vae terrae illi cuius rex eſt puer.Wo to that land whereof a child is head,Whether childe or childiſhe, the caſe is one ſure,Where Kinges be younge, we dayly ſee in bre,The people awleſſe, by weakneſſe of their head,Leade their liues lawleſſe, hauinge none to dread.And no leſſe true is this text agayne,Beata terra cuius rex eſt nobilis.Bleſt is the Land, where a ſtout Kinge doth rayne.Wherein good peace ech man poſſeſſeth his,For dread of whom, no man dare do amis,Whoſe Prince is preſt alwayes, and Sword in hand,At home and abroade, all enemies to withſtand.In caſe the ſonne had proued ſutch a one,Hardy and ſtoute as his fathers afore,Sure had he ſitten in the Royall throne,Dreadleſſe, and careleſſe of common vpror.But Henries weakeneſſe appeered more, and more,Which boldneſſe gaue, to the contrary band,To ſpoyle him at laſt both of life, and land.His humble heart was nothinge vnknowen,To the gaye gallants, of Yorkes retinue,Any lowe ground, is highly ouerflowen,And ſhored houſes cannot long continue,Ioyntes cannot knit whereas is no Synowe.And ſo a Prince, not dread aſwell as loued,By hold Traytours may bee ſoone remoued.Well mought I ſee, had I not wanted brayne,The worke begon to vndermine the ſtate,When the chiefe link was looſed fro the chayne,And that ſome durſt vpon bloud royall grate,How tickle hold I had of myne eſtate?When the chiefe poſt lay flat vppon the flore,Mought not I thinke my ſtaffe then next the dore?So mought alſo, dame Margaret the Queene,By whoſe malice this miſchife firſt began,Did ſhe (trow yee) her ſelfe not ouerweneDeath to procure to that moſt worthy man?Which ſhe and hers afterward mought well ban,On whom did hange, as I before haue ſayde,Her Huſbandes life, his honour and his ayde.For whilſt he liued which was one ſtable ſtay,Yorke and his Impes were kept as vnder Yoke,But when the Piller remoued was away,Then durſt out flame, that late before was Smoke,The cloſe Traytoure, then caſt of his Cloake,And from the dark came forth in open light,VVith titles blinde which he ſet forth for right.But this to achieue, firſt it him behoued,The Kinge and his kin a ſunder for to ſet:Who once perforce, or practice ill remoued,Then had they auoyded the principall le,VVhith kept the ſought pray ſo longe from the Net:The next poynct after, was themſelues to placeNext to the Prince, and other to abaſe.I was the firſt whom they put out of place,No cauſe pretendinge, but the common weale,The crowne on England was the very caſe,VVhy to the Commons they burned ſo in zeale,My faultes were Cloakes their practiſe to conceale,In counſayle hearinge conſider the entent,For by pretence of truth, treaſon oft is ment.So their pretence was onely to remoue,Counſayle corrupt from place about the Kinge,But O yee Princes, you it doth behoue,This caſe to conſtrue, as no fayned thinge,That neuer traytour did ſubdue his kinge,But for his plat▪ ere he would further wade,Agaynſt his frendes, the Quarel firſt hee made.And if hap he could ſo bringe about,Them to ſubdue, and haue them at his will,Then would he waxe ſo arrogant, and ſtout,That no reaſon, his outrage might fulfill,But to proceede vppon his purpoſe ſtill,Till Kinge, and Counſayle brought were in one caſe:Sutch is their folly, to rebels that geue place.So for the fiſhe, when caſt forth was the Net,The next poynct was in driuinge out the plat,Commons to cauſe, in rage to fume, and fret,And to rebell, I cannot tell for what,Requiringe redreſſe of this, and of that:Who if they ſpeede, the ſtander at receit,Graſp will the Pray, for which he doth awayt.Then by ſurmiſe of ſome thinge pretended,Sutch to diſplace as they may well ſuſpect,Like to withſtand their miſchiefe entended,And in their roumes their banders to elect,The aduerſe party proudly to reiectAnd then with reportes the ſimple to abuſe,And when theſe helpes fayle, open force to vſe.So this Dukes traynes were couert, and not ſeene.Who little ment, that which hee moſt pretended,Like to a Serpent lurkinge vnder greene,To the weale publike ſeemed wholly vended:Zelous he was, and would haue all thinges mended,But by that mendment nothinge els he ment,But to be Kinge, to that marke was his bent.For had be bin playne, as hee ment in deede,Henry to depoſe from the royall place,His haſt had bin waſte, and murch worſe his ſpeede,The Kinge then ſtandinge in his peoples grace,This Duke therefore ſetforth a goodly face,As one that ment no quarrel for the Crowne,Sutch as bare rule, he onely would put downe.But all for nought, ſo longe as I bare ſtroke,Serued theſe driftes, and proued all but vayne,The beſt helpe then, was people to prouoke,To make Commotion, and Vprores a mayne:Which to appeaſe, the Kinge himſelfe was fayne,From blacke Heath in Kent, to ſend me to the Tower,Sutch was the ſorce of Rebelles in that Hower.The tempeſt yet therewith was not ceaſſed,For Yorke was bent his purpoſe to purſue,Who ſeeinge how ſoone I was releaſſed,And ill ſucceſſe of ſufferaunce to enſue:Then like Iudas, vnto his Lord vntrue,Thynkinge time loſt any lenger to defarre,By Warwickes ayde proclaymed open warre.S. Albanes towne, where both our Hoaſtes did meete,To crye a fielde was not an equall place,For we were forſt to fight within a ſtreete,With fewe agaynſt many, ſutch was the caſe,There I and Warwicke fronted face to face,At an Inne doore, the Caſtell was the ſigne,Where with a Sworde was cut my fatall lyne.Oft was I warned to come in Caſtle none,But little thought of any Common ſigne,I did Imagine a Caſtell built with ſtone,For of no Iune, I could the ſame deuine,In Prophetes ſkill my wits were neuer fine,A foole is hee that ſutch vayne dreames doth dred,But more Foole hee, that will by them beiled.My life I loſt in that vnlucky place,VVith many Lordes that leaned to my part,The Earle Percy had no better grace,Couragious Clifford could not eſchewe the dart,Buckinghams Heyre was at this mortall mart,Babthorp the Attorney for all his ſkill in Lawe,In this poynct of pleadinge appeared very rawe.So thus poore Prince diſarmed of his bandes,His frendes all ſlayne, wantinge good aſſiſtence,VVas made a Pray vnto his enemies handes,Priued of power and Princely reuerence,And as a Pupill boyde of all experience,Innocent playne, and ſimple witted,Was as a Lambe vnto the Wolfe committed.A Parliament than was called with ſpeede,A Parliament, nay a playne conſpiracy,VVhen agaynſt right it was decreed,That after the death of the ſixt Henry,The Duke of Yorke ſhould haue the regally,And in his life, the charge, and protection,Of Kinge and Realme at the Dukes direction.And thus was Yorke declared Protectour,Protectour ſayd I, nay Proditor playne.A rancke Rebell the Princes directour,A vaſſall to leade his Lord, and Souerayne,VVhat honeſt hart would not conceiue diſdayne,To ſee the foote ſurmount aboue the head,A Monſter is in ſpight of nature bred.Some haply heere, will moue a farther dout,And for Yorkes part alledge an elder right,O braynleſſe head, that ſo runne in and out,VVhan length of time a ſtate hath firmely pight,And good accord hath putall ſtrife to flight,VVere it not better ſutch titles ſtil to ſleepe,Than all a Realme, about the tryall weepe?From the female, came Yorke, and all his leede,And wee Lancaſtrians, from the Heyre Male,Of whom thre Kinges in order did ſucceede,By iuſt diſcent: this is no fayned tale.Who would haue thought that any ſtorme or galeOur ſhip could ſhake hauinge ſutch Anker hold,None I thincke ſure, vnleſſe that God ſo would.After this burle the Kinge was fayne to flee,Northward in poſt, for ſuccour, and releefe,O bleſſed God how ſtraunge it was to ſee!A rightfull Prince purſued as a Theefe!To thee O England, what can be more repreefe?Then to purſue thy Prince with armed hand,VVhat greater ſhame, may bee to any Land?Traytours did triumph, true men lay in the duſt,Reuiage, and Robbiage, toyſted euery where,VVill, ſtoode for ſkill, and Law obeyed luſt,Might, trode downe right, of Kinge there was no feare,The title was tryed onely by Shield, and Speare:All which vnhaps, that they were not foreſeene,Suffolke was in fault, who ruled Kinge. and Queene.Some here perhaps, do looke I ſhould accuſeMy ſelfe of ſleight, or ſubtilty vniuſt,VVherein I ſhould my Princes Eares abuſeAgaynſt the Duke, to bringe him in myſtruſt,Some part whereof, though needes confeſſe I muſt,My fault onely, conſiſted in conſentTo my Foes driftes, which I could not preuent.If I at firſt whan Brandes began to ſmoke,The Sparkes to quench by any way had ſought,Neuer had England felt this mortall ſtroke,Which now to late lamentinge helpeth noughtTwo poynctes of Wit to dearely haue I bought,The firſt that better is timely to foreſee,Then after ouer late, a Counſaylour to bee.The ſecond is, not eaſely to aſſent,To any aduice, agaynſt thy faythfull frend,But of the Speaker ponder the intent,The meaninge ful, the poinct, and finall ende:A Sainct in ſhowe, in proofe is found a Fende,The ſubtile man, the ſimple to abuſe,Mutch pleaſaunt Speach, and Eloquence doth vſe.And ſo was I, and other mo abuſedBy Suffolkes ſleights, who ſought to pleaſe the Queene,Forecaſt we lackt, which cannot be excuſedOf thinges to come, as ſoone was after ſeene:Which gloſinge tongue, he made vs fooles to weene,That Humfrey did to Englandes crowne aſpyre,Which to preuent his death they did conſpyre.What ſhould I more of mine vnhaps declare,Whereof my death at laſt hath mae an ende?Not I alone was cauſe of all this care,Some beſydes mee there were that did offende.None I accuſe, nor yet my ſelfe defend,Faultes I confeſſe, as no man liues without,My chiefe fault, was folly, out of dout.Folly was chiefe, the noughty tyme was next,VVhich made my Fortune ſubiect to the chiefe:If England then with ſtrife had not bin vext.Glory might haue growen whereas enſued griefe,Yet one thinge is, my comfort, and reliefe,Conſtant I was in my Princes Quarell,To dye or lyue, and ſpared for no parel.What though Fortune enuious was my foe,A noble hart ought not the ſoner yeild,Nor ſhrincke a backe for any weale or woe,But for his Prince ly bleeding in the field:If priuy ſpight at any time mee belde,The price is payde: and greeuous is my guerdon,As for the reſt God (I truſt) will pardon.FINIS.G. F.
AFter this Tragedy ended, one ſayd ſeeinge this Duke hath ſo vehemently exclaymed agaynſt the Duke of Yorkes practiſes, it were well done to heare what hee can ſay for himſelfe. For after ye firſt battayle at S. Albanes when he toke K Henry priſoner, he was made protector, which ſo mutch greeued Queene Margaret, & her complices, y• priuy grutches, & open diſſembling neuer ceaſed til ye Duke, & his allyes were fayne to ſly both field, & Realme, he into Ireiand, & they to Calaies. Whence they came agayne with an Army, whereof Richard Neuill Earle of Saliſbury was leader, & marched towarde Couentry (where the  Kynge was, and had gathered an army to ſubdue them, & encountred them at Northampton on ye. 10. day of Iuly in yt yeare of grace. 1460. ſought with them, loſt the field, and was taken himſelfe, and many of his freendes ſlayne, as Humfrey Stafforde Duke of Buckingham, Ihon Talbot the ſecond of that name Earle of Shreweſbury, Ihon Vicounte Beaumont, Thomas Lord Egremont, Syr William Lucy, and diuers other. But ouerpaſſinge all theſe and many mo becauſe they were honourably ſlayne in the field, let vs come to him who was the chiefe cauſe thereof, that is to ſay, Richard Plantagenet Duke of York ſlayne in the battel at Wakefield on Chriſtmas euē, and Edmond Earle of Ruflande his yong ſonne, who was there murthered by the Lorde Clifforde as he woulde haue fled into the towne to haue ſaued himſelfe.

Therefore imagine that you ſee a tall mans body full of freſh woundes but lacking a head, holdinge by the hande a goodly childe, whoſe breaſt was ſo wounded that his heart might bee ſeene, hys louely face and eyes diſfigured with droppinge teares, his Hayre through horor ſtandinge vpright, his mercy crauinge handes, al to be mangled, and all his body embrued with his owne blould, out of the Weſand pipe of which headles body came a ſhreking voyce ſayinge as followeth.

# HOW RICHARD PLANtagenet Duke of Yorke was ſlayne through his ouer raſh boldneſſe, and his Sonne Earle of Rutland an Infant cruelly murdered Anno. 1460.
TRuſt Fortune (quoth he) in whom was neuer truſt,O Beaſtes moſt brute, that haue no better grace,All reſt, renowne, and deedes lye in the duſt,Of all the ſort that ſue her ſlipper trace,How now? Why doſt thou Baldwin hide thy face?Thou needeſt not feare, although Imiſſe my head,See this poore Boy, whom by the hand I lead.The cauſe why I thus lead him in my hand,With bloud, and teares halinge his body ſtaynd,Is that thou mayeſt the better vnderſtand,How hardly Fortune hath for vs ordayndeIn whom her loue and hate be whole contaynde.Rychard I am Plantagenet by name,Whilom of Yorke the Duke of worthy fame.For Richard Earle of Cambridge, eldeſt ſonneOf Duke Edmond, thirde ſonne of King Edward,Engendred me whereof the courſe did runne,Of Mortimers to be the Iſſue gard:For when Edmond ber brother dyed Warde,She was ſole heyre by due diſcent of line,VVhereby her Rightes, and Titles all were mine.But marke me now I pray the Baldwin marke,And ſee how force oft ouerbeareth right,Way how vſurpers tyrannouſly warke,To keepe by murther that they get by might,And note what troubles and daungers do alight,On ſuch as ſeeke to repoſſeſſe their owne,And how by might, oft right is ouerthrowne.Duke Henry of Hereforde called Bolenbrooke.Of whom Duke Mowbray told the now of late,Whan traytour like he had king Richard tooke:Kild him in priſon, vſurped his eſtate,Without al right, or title, ſauing hateOf others rule, or loue to rule alone,Theſe two excepted tytle had hee none.The Crowne by right came to Edmond MortimerWhoſe Father Roger was king Richardes heire,Which cauſed Henry, and them of Lancaſter,To ſeeke all ſhiftes our houſes to appayre,For ſure he was to ſit beſide the chayre,Were wee of power to clayme our lawful right,And therfore thought good, to extirpe vs quight.His curſed ſonne enſued the fathers trade,And kept my coſin guiltleſſe in ſure hold,For whom my father ful often did perſwade,With his allies and conſins that they would.Their Kinſmans right mainteyn and vphold.And to depoſe by pollicy or power.The heyre of him that was an vſurper.Whereof when Henry of that name the fift,Had heard, and knew of this conſpiracye,He from ſir Edmond al the blame to ſhift,Sayd that my Father was the French kings aly,And hyred by him to worke this trecherye,For which at Hampton as it came to paſſe,His lyfe he loſt, and there veheaded was.Thus was the name of Mortimer extinct,Whoſe right and title deſcended vnto me,Being forſt to lyue, within a precinctFor feare I would to other countries fleeAnd ſo beeing at myne owne libertee,Might haplye moue ſedicion or ſtrife,For guilty hartes, can leade no quiet lyfe.Yet at the laſt in Henries dayes the ſixt,I was reſtored to my fathers landes,Made duke of Yorke: where through my mind I fixt,To get the Crowne and kingdome in my handes,For ayde wherein I knit aſſured bandesWith Neuils ſtocke, whoſe daughter was my makeWhereby great frendes I had my part to take.O Lord what hap had I by mariage,Fowre fayre Sonnes my yong wife to me bore,Valiaunt men and prudent for their age,Such brothers ſhe had and nephewes ſtil in ſtoreAs none of the kin had any time before:The Earle of Saliſburie, & his ſonne of Warwicke,Were knights peereleſſe, frō Barbary to Barwick.Through helpe of whom, & Fortunes frendly grace,I firſt began to claime my lawful right,And my chiefe foes with ſtoutneſſe to deface.I rayſed power at al pointes preſt to fight:Of whom the chiefe that chiefly bare me ſpight,Was Somerſet the Duke, whom to annoyAl my hole force, I dayly did employ.And maugre him ſo choyſe lo was my chaunce,Yea though the Queene was wholy on hys ſyde,I twiſe vare rule in Normandy and Fraunce,And laſt lieutenant in Ireland I did byde,Ful often driuen of force my head to hyde,Yet through the loue, my doinges there did breede,I had their helpe at al times in my neede.This doutye Duke moſt deare to King and Queene,With armed hoaſte, I thriſe met in the field,The firſt vnfought through treaty made betweene,The ſecond ioynde wherein the King did yelde,The Duke was ſlayne, the Queene her partie heldeFarre in the North, where ouermatcht with powerMy life I loſt, in an vnlucky howre.Before this laſt were other battailes three,The firſt the Earle of Saliſburie alone,Fought on Bloreheath, and got the victorie,I at the next was preſent in perſoneWith my chiefe kin, whereas by one and one,Our ſouldiers falſe, withdrew away by night,Vnto our foes and wee put all to flight.This Boy and I in Ireland did vs ſaue,Mine eldeſt ſonne with Warwicke and his father,To Calais got, whence by the read I gaueThey came againe to London, and did gather,Another hoaſt, whereof I ſpake no rather:And met our foes ſlew many a Lord and knight,And tooke the King and draue the Queene to flight.This doue I came to England all in haſte,New claime to make vnto the realme and crowne,And in the houſe while Parliament did laſt,In the Kinges ſeate, I boldly ſate me downe,Clayming the place, whereat the Lordes did frown,But what for that, I did ſo wel proceede,That al at laſt to my demaund agreed.But ſith Henry had raigned than ſo long,They would be ſhould continue til he dyed.And to thend to make my title ſtrong,Apparant heire of England they me cryed,But ſith the Queene and others this denied,I ſped me ſtraight Northward whereas ſhe lay,Meaning by force to cauſe her to obay.She thereof warned, prepared a ſtrong power.And ere my men were altogether redyeTo Sandale came, where in a diſmal houreI like a Beaſt, ſo raſh was, and ſo heddyTo trie Fortune, which alwaies is vnſteddyWith thouſands fiue, of ſouldiers to aſſayleThe double number, in campe to their auayle.And ſo was ſlayne at firſt: and whyle my pore infantScarſe twelue yere olde, ſought way himſelfe to ſaue,That cruel Clifford that fel bloudy tyrant,While the pore chyld with tears did mercy craue,With dagger ſharp his hart a ſunder claue.This don he came to the campe where I lay dead,Diſpoyld my corps, and cut away my head.And ſet a crowne of paper therupponWhich for a ſport he ſent vnto the QueneAnd ſhe for ſpyte commaunded it anon.To be had to Yorke and ſet vp to be ſene.In ſome ſuch place as theuis & Traitors bene,This mocke I had of fortune for rewarde,After long hope that ſhe wold me regardWherfore Baldwin ſee that thou ſet her forthWith her ſlipper pranks ſo as they may be known,And warne all princes wel to way the worthOf thinges, for which the ſide of war be ſowenThe gaine no ſurer but as of dice throwenNo worldly good can counterpeyze the pryſeOf halfe the paynes that may therof aryſe.Better it were to loſe a peece of right,Then limmes and life in wreſtling for the ſame,It is not force, of frendſhip nor of might,But god aboue that kingdomes ſet in frameNot wit, but chance doth weild the winners game,Wherfore if we our follies would refrayne,Tyme woulde redreſſe all wronges we voyde of payne.Wherfore warne Lordes no wiſe to wade in warreFor any cauſe, ſaue their countries defence,Their troublous titles are vnworthy farreThe bloud, the life, the ſpoile of innocence,Of ſcendes, of foes, behold my long expence,And neuer the neare: beſt than to tary time,Low by the ground, than ouer high to clyme.FINIS.
WIth that maiſter Ferrers ſhoke me by the ſleeue ſaying: why how now man do you forget your ſelfe? belike you mynde oure matters very much. So I do in deede (ſaid I) for I dreame of them. And whan I had rehearſed my dreame, we had long talke concerning the nature of dreames, which to ſtint, and to bringe vs to oure matter agayne, thus ſayde one of them: I am glad it was your chaunce to dreame of Duke Richarde for it had bene pitty to haue ouerpaſſed him.

And as concerning this Lorde Clifforde which ſo cruelly killed his ſonne, I purpoſe to geeue you notes: Who (as he wel deſerued) came ſhortlye after to a ſodaine death, and yet too good for a cruell tyraunt. For on Palmeſonday next folowing, being the 29. Daye of March, in the yeare of Chriſte, a Thouſand foure hundreth threeſcore and one, this Lord Clifford with Henry Percy the thirde Earle of Northumberlande, the Earle of Weſtmerlande,  the Lorde Dacres, the Lorde Welles & other were ſlayne at Towton in Yorkeſhyre. Wherfore as you thought you ſawe & heard the headleſſe Duke ſpeake thorowe his necke, ſo nowe ſuppoſe you ſee this Lord Clifford al armed ſaue his head, with his Breaſt plate all gore bloud running from his throate, wherein an headleſſe Arrowe ſticketh, through which wound, he ratleth out this Rhime.

# Howe the Lorde Clifforde for his extreame crueltie, came to a cruel, ſtraunge, & ſodaine death. Anno. 1461.
OPen confeſſion aſketh open Penaunce,Yet wiſdome would a man his fault ſhould hide:But ſith pardon commeth by repentaunce,Playneſſe is beſt when truth is plainly tryde,Open or hid, al faultes at length be ſpyed.For couer fyer neuer ſo cloſe within,Yet out it will and ſo will ſecret ſynne.As for my ſelfe, my faultes be out ſo playne,Bruted and knowne abroade in euery place,That though I would I cannot them reteyne,Al care is booteleſſe in a cureleſſe caſe,To learne by others ſome haue had the grace,Wherfore Baldwin, write thou my wretched fall,The brief wherof I briefly vtter ſhal.Clifford I am that ſlue Duke Richards childe,The louely babe that craued lyfe with teares:Wherby my fame, moſt fouly I defiledPore ſely Lambes the Lyon neuer teares,The feble mouſe may ly among great bearesBut wrath of man his rancoure to requyt,Forgets al reaſon, ruth and mercy quyte.I meane ſuch wrath as works parental wrekeSurnamed a vertu (as theſe reuengers ſay)But little know thoſe people what they ſpeakWhich kyndle vs, our ennemis kin o ſlay,To puniſhe ſinne is good, it is no nay.They wreke not ſinne, but merit wreke for ſinne,The fathers faultes that wreake vpon the kinne.Becauſe my father Lord Iohn Clifforde diedSlayne at S.

WHan this tragedy was ended, O Lord ſaid another, how horrible a thing is diuiſion in a Realme, to how manye miſchieues is it the mother, what vice is not thereby kindled, what vertue left vnquenched?

For what was the cauſe of the Duke of Yorkes death and of the cruelty ſhewed to his young ſonne by this mercileſſe man, ſaue the variaunce betwene King Henry and the houſe of Yorke: which at length beſides millions of the Commons, brought to deſtruction moſt part of the nobility. For Edward the Dukes eldeſt ſonne immediatly after Richarde his father was ſlayne, through helpe of the Neuils gaue the kinge a battaile at Towton in Yorkeſhire, whereat beſydes this Clifford, were ſlayne y• Earles of Northumberlande, and Weſtmerland, with the Lordes Dacres and Welles, beſydes mo then 3000. men, the winning of which fyeld brought Edward to the Crowne, and the loſſe draue K. Henry and his wyfe into Scotland. But as fewe raignes beginne without bloud, ſo King Edwarde to keepe the cōmon courſe, cauſed Thomas Courtney earle of Deuonſhyre, and Iohn Veer Earle of Oxenford, and Awbrey Veer eldeſt ſonne to y• ſaid Earle, with diuers other of King Henries parte, to bee attainted and put to death. And ſhortly after did execution vppon the Duke of Somerſet, and the Lordes Hungerford, & Roſſe, whom hee tooke priſoners at Exham fyelde. For thyther  came thoſe Lordes with king Henry out of Scotland, with an armye of Scots, and ſought a Battayle, which they loſt, wherein moſt part of theym were ſlaine. And becauſe theſe are al noble men I wil leaue them to Baldwins diſcrecion.

But ſeeinge the Earle of Worceſter was the chiefe inſtrument, whom king Edward vſed aſwel in theſe mens matters, as in like bloudye affayres, becauſe he ſhould not be forgotten, ye ſhal heare what may bee noted by his ende.

# THE INFAMOVS ENDE of the Lord Tiptoft, Earle of VVorceſtre, for executing his princes crueltie. Anno. 1470.
THe glorious man, is not ſo loath to Wurke,As the infamous glad to lye vnknowen:Which maketh me Baldwin diſalow thy lurke,Where Princes faultes ſo openly be blowen,I ſpeake not this alonelye for mine owneWhich were my Princes (if that they were anye)But for my Pieres, in number very many.Or might report vprightly vſe her tongue,It would leſſe greeue vs to augment the matter.But ſure I am thou ſhalt be forſt among,To frayne the truth, the liuing for to flatter:And other whiles in pointes vnknowen to ſmatter.For time neuer was, nor neuer I thinke ſhalbeThat truth vnſhent, ſhould ſpeake in al things free.This doth appere (I dare ſay) by my ſtorye,Which diuers wryters diuerſly declare,But ſtory wryters ought for neither glory,Feare, nor fauor, truth of things to ſpare,But ſtil it fares as alwayes it did fare,Affections, feare, or doubtes that dayly brue,Do cauſe that ſtories alwayes be not true.Vnfruiteful Fabian followed the faceOf time and dedes, but let the cauſes ſlip,Which Hall hath added ſome with better grace,For feare I thinke leſt trouble might him trip:For this or that (ſayth he) he felt the whip.This ſtory wryters leaue the cauſes out,Or ſhew them ſo as they were in ſome dout.But ſeyng cauſes are the chefeſt thingesThat ſhould be noted of the ſtory wryters,That men may learne what endes al cauſes bringes,They be vnworthy the name of ChroniclersThat leaue them cleane out of their regiſters,Or doubtfully report them for the fruiteOf reading ſtoryes ſtandeth in the ſuite.Wherfore Baldwin either ſpeake thou vpryghtOf our affaiers, or touch them not at allAs for my ſelfe I way al thinges ſo lyght,That naught I paſſe, how men report my fallThe truth wherof yet playnly ſhewe I ſhalThat thou mayſt wryte and other therby reede,What thinges I did wherof they ſhould take heede.Thou haſt heard of Tiptoftes Earles of Worceſter,I am that Lorde that lyued in Edwardes dayesThe fowerth, and was his frend and counſailour,And Butcher too, as common rumor ſayes.But Peoples voyce is neither ſhame nor prayſe,For whom they would aliue deuour to daye,To morow dead they wil worſhip what they may.But though the peoples verdite go by chaunce,Yet was their cauſe to call mee as they did,For I enforſt by meane of Gouernaunce,Did execute what ere my king did bid,From blame therein my ſelfe I cannot ryd:But fye vpon the wretched ſtate that muſt,Defame it ſelfe to ſerue the Princes luſt.The chiefeſt cryme wherewith men dome charge,Is death of the Earle of Deſmundes noble ſonnes,Of which the kinges charge doth me cleare diſchargeBy ſtrait commaundement and iniunctions:Theffect whereof ſo rigourouſlye runnesThat either I muſt procure to ſee them dead,Or for contempt as traytour looſe my head.What would mine enemies doe in ſuch a caſe,Obey the king or proper death procure?They may wel ſay their fancy for a face,But life is ſweete and loue hard to recure,They would haue done as I did I am ſure:For ſeeldom wil a wealthy man ateaſe,For others cauſe his Prince in ought diſpleaſe.How much leſſe I which was lieutenaunt thanIn the Iriſh Iſle, preferred by the king:But who for loue or dread of any manConſentes to accompliſh any wicked thing,Although chiefe fault thereof from other ſpring,Shal not eſcape Gods vengeaunce for his deede:Who ſcuſeth none that dare do il for dreede.This in my king and mee may wel appeare,Which for our faultes did not eſcape the ſcourge:For whan we thought our ſtate moſt ſure and cleare,The wynde of Warwicke blew vp ſuch a ſourge,As from the realme and crowne, the king did vrge,And me alſo from office, frendes and wyfe,From good report, from honeſt death and life.The Earle of Warwicke, through mallice and grudge,Which to King Edward cauſeleſſe he did beare,Out of his Realme by force did make him trudge,And ſet King Henrie againe vpon his chaire,And than al ſuch as Edwardes louers wereAs traytaurs tane, were greuouſly oppreſt,But chiefelye I, becauſe I loued him beſt.And ſih my goods, and liuinges were not ſmal,Some greedy gulles did beare the world in handFor ten yeares ſpace that I was cauſe of allMurder, and miſchiefe, done within the land,For this did ſuch as did not vnderſtandMine enmies drift, thinke all reportes were true:And ſo to hate me worſe then any Iewe.For ſeeldome ſhal a ruler looſe his lyfe,Before falſe rumours openly be ſpred,Whereby this prouerbe is as true as ryfe,That rulers rumors hunt about a head,Frowne Fortune once all good report is fled,For preſent ſhew doth make the mainy blinde,And ſuch as ſee dare not diſcloſe their mynde.Through this was I king Edwards butcher namedAnd bare the ſhame of all his cruel deedes:I cleare me not I worthely was blamed,Though force was ſuch I muſt obaye him needes,With hieſt rulers ſeldome wel it ſpeedes,For they be euer neareſt to the nyp,And fault who ſhal, for al feele they the whyp.For whan I was by Parliament attainted,King Edwardes euils al were counted mine.No truth auayled ſo lies were faſt and painted,Which made the People at my life repine,Crying Crucifige kil that Butchers lyne,That whan I ſhould haue gone to Blockham feaſtI could not paſſe, ſo ſore they on me preſt.And had not bene the officers ſo ſtrong,I thinke they would haue ſwalowed me alyue,Howbeit hardly haled from the throng,I was in the Fleete faſt ſhrowded by the Shriue,Thus one dayes lyfe their mallice did me giue:Which when they knew, for ſpite the next day after,They kept them calme, ſo ſuffred I the ſlaughterNow tel me Baldwin what fault doeſt thou fyndeIn me, that iuſtly ſhould ſuch death deſerue?None ſure, except deſire of honour blinde,VVhich made me ſeeke in offices to ſerve:VVhat minde ſo good that honours make not ſwerue?So mayſt thou ſee it onely was myſtateThat cauſed my Death and brought me ſo in hate.Warne therfore al men wiſely to beware,What offices they enterpriſe to beare:The higheſt alway moſt maligned are,Of Peoples grudge, and princes hate in feare,For Princes faultes his faultors al men teare.Which to auoyde, let none ſuch office take,Saue he that can for right his Prince forſake.FINIS.
THis Typtoftes Tragedye was not ſo ſone iniſhed, but one of the company had prouided for another, of a notable perſon Lorde Tiptoftes chiefe Enemie, concerning whom hee ſaid: Lord God what truſt is there in worldly chaū ces? what ſtay in any proſperity? for ſee the Earle of Warwicke which cauſed the earle of Worceſter to be apprehended, attainted, and put to death, triumphing with his old impriſoned & new vnpriſonned Prince K. Hēry, was by & by after & his brother with him, ſlayne at Barnet field by king Edward whom he had before time damaged diuers wayes.  As firſt by his frendes at Banbury fielde, where to reuēge the death of his coſin Henry Neuil ſir Iohn Coniers, and Iohn Clappā his ſeruaūtes ſlew 5. thouſande welſhmē and beheaded their captaynes, the Earle of Pembroke, & ſir Richarde Harbert his brother after they were yelded priſoners, of whom ſir Richard Harbert was the talleſt gentlemā both of his perſon & hands that euer I read or hearde of. At which time alſo, Robin of Ridſdale, a rebell of therle of Warwicks rayſing, toke the earle Riuers K. Edwards wiues father, and his ſonne Iohn, at his mannour of Grafton, & caryed them to Northhampton, and there without cauſe or proces beheaded them: Whiche ſpites to requite, king Edwarde cauſed the Lorde Stafford of Southwike, one of Warwickes chiefe indes, to be taken at Brente march, and headed at Bridgewater.

This cauſed yt Earle ſhortlye to rayſe his power, to encounter the kinge which came againſt him with an armye, beſide Warwicke at Woley, where he wan the field, toke the king priſoner, and kept him a while in Yorkeſhyre in Middleham caſtle: whence (as ſom ſay) he releaſed him again, but other think he corrupted his kepers & ſo eſcaped. Then throughe the Lords ye matter was taken vp betweene them & they broughte to talke together, but becauſe they could not agre, y• earle araiſed a new army, wherof he made Captaine the Lord Welles ſonne, whyche broile king Edward minding to appeaſe by pollicy  fouly diſtained his honour committing periury for he ſente for the Lorde Welles and his brother Syr Thomas Dymocke, vnderſafe conduite promiſing them vpon his fayth to keepe them harmeleſſe: But after, becauſe yt Lord Welles ſonne would not diſſolue his army, beheaded theim both & went wt hys power into Lincolnſhyre & there fought with Sir Robert Welles, and ſlew ten thouſand of his ſouldiers (yet ran they a way ſo faſt, that caſting of their clothes for yt more ſpeede, cauſed it to be called Loſe coate fielde (and toke ſir Robert and other, and put them to death in the ſame place.

This miſfortune forced the Earle of Warwicke to ſayle into Fraunce where he was entertayned of y• kinge a while, and at laſt with ſuch pore helpe as he procured there of Duke Rainer, and other, he came into England agayne, and encreaſed ſutch a power in kinge Henries name, that as the Lorde Tiptofte ſayd in his tragedy, kinge Edward vnable to abide him, was fayne to flie ouer the waſhes in Lincolnſhyre to get a ſhip to ſayle out of his kingdom to his brother in lawe the Duke of Burgoine: So was king Henry reſtored againe to yt kingdome. Al theſe deſpites, and troubles the Earle wroughte agaynſt kinge Edward. But Hēry was ſo infortunate that ere halfe a yeare was expyred, kinge Edward came backe agayne, and empriſoned him, & gaue ye Earle a fielde, wherein he ſlewe both him, and his brother. I haue recounted thus much before hand for ye better  opening of the ſtory, which if it ſhould haue bin ſpoken in his Tragedy would rather haue made a volume than a Pamphlete. For I entend onely to ſay in ye Tragedy, what I haue noted in the Earle of Warwickes perſon, wiſhinge that theſe other noble men, whō I haue by the way touched, ſhould not be forgotten.

And therefore imagin that you ſee this Earle lyinge wt his brother in Poules Church in his Coate armure, with ſutch a Face, and Countenaunce as hee beareth in Portrayture ouer ye dore in Poules at the goinge downe to Ieſus Chapple from the South end of the Quier ſtayres, and ſayinge as followeth.

# HOW SIR RICHARD Neuill Earle of Warwicke, and his Brother Iohn, Lord Marquiſe Montacute, through their to mutch boldneſſe were ſlayne at Barnet, the 14. of Aprill. Anno. 1471. *⁎*
AMonge the heauy heape of happy KnightesVVhom Fortune ſtald vpon her ſtayleſſe ſtage,Oft hoyſt on high, oft pight in wretched plightes,Behold me Baldwin, A per ſe of my age,Lord Richard Neuill, Earle by mariageOf Warwicke Duchy, of Sarum by diſcent,VVhich erlt my father through his mariage hent.VVouldſte thou beholde falſe Fortune in her kindeNote well my ſelfe ſo ſhalt thou ſee her naked:Full fayre before, but tootoo foule behinde,Moſt drowſie ſtill whan moſt ſhe ſeemes awaked:My fame, and ſhame her ſhift full oft hath ſhaked,By enterchaunge alowe, and vp aloft,The Lylard like that chaungeth hew full oft.For while the Duke of Yorke in life remayn'deMine vncle deace, I was his happy hand:In all attempts my purpoſe I attayn'de,Though Kinge, and Queene, and moſt Lordes of the LandVVith all their power did often me withſtand:For God gaue Fortune, and my good behauiourDid from their Prince ſteale me the peoples fauour.So that through me in fieldes right manly fought:By force myne vncle tooke king Henry twyſe,As for my coſin Edwarde I ſo wrought.VVhen both our ſyers wer ſlain through raſh aduiceThat he at chiede his fathers enterpryſe:For into Scotland king and Quene we chaſed,By meane wherof the kingdome he embraced.Which after he had enioyed in quyet peace,(For ſhortly after was king Henry take,And put in priſon his power to encreaſe,I went to Fraunce and match him with a makeThe French kings daughter, whom he did forſake:For while with payne I brought this ſute to paſſe,He to a widow raſhly wedded was.This made the French king ſhreudly to miſtruſt,That all my treaties had but ill pretence,And when I ſaw my king ſo bent to luſt,That with his fayth he paſt not to diſpence,Which is a Princes honours chiefe defence:I could not reſt til I had found a meane.To mend his miſſe, or els to marre him cleane.Wherfore I me allied with his brother George,Encenſing him his brother to maligneThrough many a tale I did agaynſt him forge:So that through power that we from Calais bringeAnd found at home we fcayd ſo the kynge,That he did flye to Freſeland warde amayn,Wherby king Henry had the crown agayne.Than put we therle of Worceſter to deathKing Edwardes frend a man lo fowle defamedAnd in the whyle came Edward into breath.For with the Duke of Burgoyne ſo he framedThat with the power that he to him had named,Vnloked for he came to England ſtreightAnd got to Yorke and tooke the towne by ſleight.And after through the ſufferance of my brother,Which like a beaſt occaſion fouly loſt,He came to London ſafe with many otherAnd tooke the towne to good king Henryes coſt:Who was through him from poſt to piller toſt,Til Therle of Oxeford, I and other more,Aſſembled power his fredome to reſtore.VVher of king Edward warned came with ſpede,And camped with his hoaſt in Barnet towneWhere we right fearce encountered him in deedeOn Eaſter day right early on the downe:There many a man was ſlayne and ſtriken downeOne either ſide and neyther part did gayneTil that I and my brother both were ſlayne.For we to hart our ouermatched men,Forſake out ſtedes, and in the thickeſt thronge,Ran preacing forth on fte, and fought ſo thenThat downe we draue them wer they neuer ſo ſtrōgBut ere this lucke had laſted very long:With number and force we were ſo fouly cloyed,And reſcue fayld, that quite we were diſtroyed,Now tell me Baldwin haſt thou hard or readOf any man that did as I haue done?That in his tyme ſo many armyes ld,And victory at euery voyage won?Haſt thou euer hard of ſubiect vnder ſonne,That plaſt and beaſt his ſouerayne ſo oft,By enterchaunge now low and then aloft:Perchaunce thou thinkſt my doinges were not ſuchAs I and other do affirme they were.And in thy mynd I ſe thou muſeſt muchWhat meanes I vſde, that ſhould me ſo preferre:Wherin becauſe I wil thou ſhalt not erreThe truth of al I wil at large recite,The ſhort is this: I was no hypocrite.I neuer did nor ſayd ſaue what I ment,The common weale was ſtil my chefeſt careTo priuate gayn or glory was I neuer bent,I neuer paſt vpon delicious fate.Of nedeful foode my bord was neuer bare,N creditour did curſe me day by dayI vſed playneneſſe, euer pitch and pay.I heard poore ſouldiers and pore workmen whyneBecauſe their dutyes were not truely payd.Agayne I ſaw how people did repyneAt thoſe through whom their payments wer delaydeAnd profe did oft aſſure (as ſcripture ſayd)That god doth wreke the wretched peoples greues.I ſaw the polles cut of from polling theues.This made mee alway iuſtly for to deale,VVhich whan the people plainely vnderſtoode,Becauſe they ſaw me minde the common weale.They ſtill endeuoured how to do me good,Ready to ſpend their ſubſtaunce, life, and bloud,In any cauſe whereto I did them moue:For ſuer they were it was for their behoue.And ſo it was. For whan the Realme decayedBy ſutch as good Kinge Henry ſore abuſed,To mend the ſtate I gaue his Enemies ayd:But whan Kinge Edward ſinfull praks ſtill vſed,And would not mend, I likewiſe him refuſed:And holpe vp Henry, better of the twayne,And in his Quarrell (iuſt I thinke) was ſlayne.And therefore Baldwin teach by proofe of mee,That ſutch as couet peoples loue to get,Muſt ſee their workes, and wordes in all agree:Lyue liberally, and keepe them out of det,On common weale let all their care be ſet:For vpright dealinge, debts payd, poore ſuſtayned,Is meane whereby all harts are throughly gayned.FINIS.
AS ſoone as y• Earle had ended this admonition, ſure (ſaid one) I thinke the Earle of Warwick although hee were a glorious man hath ſayde no more of himſelfe than what is true. For if hee had not had notable good  vertues, or vertuous qualities, and vſed lawdable meanes in his trade of life, the people would neuer haue loued him, as they did: But God be wt him, & ſend his ſoule reſt, for ſure his body neuer had any. And although he dyed, yet ciuill warres ceaſed not. For immediatly after his deth came Queene Margaret with a power out of Fraunce, bringing with her, her yongue ſone Prince Edward: & with ſutch frendes as ſhe founde here, gaue Kinge Edward a battell at Thewkeſbury, where both ſhee, and her ſonne were taken pryſoners, with Edmond Duke of Somerſet her chief captayne: whoſe ſonne Lord Ihon, and the Earle of Deuonſhire were ſlayne in fight, and the Duke himſelfe with diuers other immediatly beheaded. Whoſe infortunes are worthy to be remembred, chiefly Prince Edwards, whom the King for ſpeaking truth, cruelly ſtroke with his Gauntet, & his Brethren cruelly murthered. But ſeeinge yt time ſo farre ſpent, I will paſſe them ouer, and with them Fawconbridge that ioly Rour beheaded at Southampton: whoſe commotiō made in Kent, was cauſe of ſely Henries deſtruction. And ſeing king Henry himſelf was cauſe of the deſtruction of many noble princes, beinge of all other moſt vnfortunate hymſelfe, I will declare what I haue noted in hys vnlucky lyfe: Who wounded in Pryſon with a Dagger, may lament his wretchedneſſe in manner followinge. *⁎*

THis tragedy ended, another ſayd: either you or Kinge Henry are a good Philoſopher ſo narrowly to argue ye cauſes of miſfortunes? but there is nothinge to experience which taught, or might teach the kinge this leſſon.

But to proceede in our matter: I fynde mention here ſhortly after ye death of this king, of a Duke of Exceſter founde deade in the ſea betwene Douer & Calais, but what hee was, or by what aduenture he died, maiſter Fabian hath not ſhewed, and maiſter Hall hath ouerſkipped him: ſo that excepte we be frendlier vnto him, he is like to be double drowned, both in ſea, and in the gulfe of forgetfulnes. About this matter was much talke, but becauſe one tooke vpon him to ſeeke out that ſtory, that charge was committed to him.

And to be occupied in ye meane while I haue foūde the ſtory of one drowned likewiſe, and that ſo notable, though priuily, that all the world knew of it wherefore I ſayd: becauſe night approcheth, and y• we will looſe no time, yee ſhall heare what I haue noted concerning the Duke of Clarence, king Edwards brother, who al to be waſhed in Wyne, may bewayle his infortune after this maner. *⁎*

otherHis faythfull Frendes, and kindeſt of his kin,So Richard Duke of Gloceſter, his very Brother,Maligned him, and beaſtly did him Smouther.A Deuiliſh deede, a moſt vnkindly part,Yet iuſt reuenge for his vnnaturall hart.Although this Brother Queller, Tyrant fellEnuied our State, as mutch, and more than he:Yet did his cloakinge Flattery ſo excellTo all our Frendes ward, chiefly vnto me,That he appeard, our truſty ſtay to bee:For outwardly he wrought, our State to furder,VVhere inwardly he minde nought ſaue murder.Thus in appearaunce who but I was bleſt?The chiefeſt honours heaped on my head:Beloued of all, enioying quiet reſt,The froward Prince by me alone was led,A Noble Impe, to all good vertues bred:The Kinge my Liege without my counſayle knowne,Agreed nought: though wiſeſt were his owne.But quiet bliſſe in no ſtate laſteth longeAſſayled ſtill by miſchiefe many wayes:Whoſe ſpoylinge battry glowinge hote, and ſtronge,No flowinge wealth, no force nor Wiſedome ſtaiesHer ſmoakeleſſe Poulder beaten Souldiers ſtaies.By open force, foule miſchiefe oft preuayls,By ſecert ſleight, ſhe ſeeld her purpoſe fayls.The Kinge was bent to mutch to fooliſh pleaſure,In banquetinge he had ſo great delight:This made him grow in groſneſſe out of meaſure,Which, as it kindleth carnall appetite,So quencheth it the liuelyneſſe of the ſpirite.Whereof enſue ſutch Sickneſſe, and diſeaſesAs none can cure ſaue death that all diſpleaſes.Through this fault furdered by his Brothers fraud(Now God forgeue mee if I Iudge amiſſe)Or through that beaſt his ribald or his BaudThat larded ſtill theſe ſinfull luſts of his,He ſodaynly forſooke all worldly bliſſe.That loathed leach, that neuer welcome death,Through Spaſmous humours ſtopped vp his breath.That tyme lay I at Ludloe, Wales his border,For

Duke Richard made himſelfe ProtectorOf Kinge, and Realme by open Proclamation,Though neyther Kinge nor Queene were his Elector,Thus he preſumed by lawleſſe vſurpation.But will you ſee his deepe diſſimulation?Hee ſent me a diſh of Deinties from his BordeThat day, and with it this falſe frendly word.Commend me to him all things ſhalbe well,I am his frend, bid him be of good cheare:Theſe newes I prayed the Meſſenger go tellMy Nephue Richard, whom I loued full deare.But what he ment by well, now ſhall you heare:He thought it well to haue vs quickly murdered,Which not longe after thorowly he furdered.For ſtrait from thence we cloſely were conuayedFrom Iayle to Iayle Northward we wiſt not whither:Where after we had a while in ſunder ſtrayed,At laſt we met at Pomfret all together.Syr Richard Ratcliffe had vs welbome thyther,Who openly, all law, and right contemnedBeheaded vs before we were condemned.My Cooſin Richard could not be contentTo leaue his life, becauſe he wiſt not why.Good Gentleman that neuer harme had ment,Therefore hee aſked wherefore hee ſhould dye:The Prieſt his ghoſtly Father did replyeWith weepinge eyes: I know one wofull cauſe,The Realme hath neyther righteous Lordes, nor lawes.Sir Thomas Vaughan chaſinge cryed ſtill:This Tyraunt Gloceſter is the graceleſſe G.That will his Brothers Children beaſtly kill.And leaſt the people through his talke might ſeeThe miſchiefs toward, and thereto not agreeOur Tormentour that falſe periured KnightBad ſtop our mouthes, with wordes of high diſpight.Thus dyed we guiltleſſe proceſſe heard we none,No cauſe alleagde, no Iudge, nor yet accuſer,No queſt empaneld paſſed vs vppon.That murdrer Ratcliffe, Law, and Rights refuſer,Did all to flatter Richard his abuſer.Vnhappy both that euer they were borne,Through guiltleſſe bloud that haue their ſoules forlorne.In part I graunt, I well deſerued this,Becauſe I cauſed not ſpeedy executionBe done on Richard for that murder of his,VVhen firſt he wrought Kinge Henries cloſe confuſion.Not for his Brothers hatefull perſecution.Theſe cruell murders paynefull death deſeruedVVhich had be ſuffred, many had bin preſerued.VVarne therefore all that charge, or office beareTo ſee all murdrers ſpeedely executed:And ſpare them not for fauour or for feare:By guiltleſſe bloud the earth remaynes polluted.For lacke of Iuſtice kingdomes are tranſmuted.They that ſaue murdrers from deſerued payne,Shall through thoſe murdrers, miſerably be ſlayne.FINIS.
WHā I had read this, they liked it very wel, one wiſhed yt the combat which hee fought with the Baſtard of Burgoyne, and the Honour which he wan wt both ſpeare & Axe ſhould not be forgotten. Another moued a queſtion about a great matter, and yt is the variaunce of the Chronicles about the Lord Thomas Graye Marquiſe Dorcet: whō Fabian euery wher calleth ye queenes brother: ſir Thomas Moore and Hal, call him the Queenes ſonne as hee was in very deede. Fabian ſaith he was gouernour of yt Prince, and had ye conueiaunce of him frō Ludlo towards Londō. The other (whom we follow) ſay he was than at London wt the Queene prouiding for the kinges coronation, and toke Sanctuary with her as ſone as hee heard of the apprehending of his vncle. This diſagreing of wryters is a great hindraunce of ye truth, and no ſmal combraunce to ſuch as be diligent readers, beſides the harme that may happen in ſucceſſion of heritages. It were therefore a worthye and good deede for the nobility, to cauſe all the recordes to be ſought, and a true and perfect Chronicle there out to be written Vnto which we refer ye deciding of this & of all other like controuerſies, geuinge this to vnderſtand in the meane time, that no man ſhall thincke his title eyther better or worſe by any thing that is written in any part of this treatiſe. For the onely thing which is purpoſed herein, is by example of others miſeries, to diſſwade al men frō al ſinnes  and vices. If by the way we touch any thinge concerninge titles, we follow therein Halles Chronicle. And were wee ſeeme to ſwarue from hys reaſons and cauſes of diuers doinges, there wee gather vppon cōiecture ſutch things as ſeeme moſt probable, or at the leaſt moſt conuenient for the furderaunce of our purpoſe. Whan the reader would haue proceeded in the Chronicle which ſtraighte intreateth of the villanous deſtruction of the Lord Haſtings, I willed him to ſurceas, becauſe I had there hys Tragedy very learnedly penned. For the better vnderſtandinge whereof, you muſt imagine yt you ſee him newly crept out of his graue, and ſpeakinge to mee as followeth.

A goodly caſt,And wel contriued, fowle caſt away for haſt.Whereto another gan in ſcoffe replie,Firſt pend it was by enſpiring prophecie.So can God reape vp ſecret miſchiefes wrought,To the confuſion of the workers thought.My Lords, the tub, that dround the Clarence Duke,Dround not his death, nor yet his deathes rebuke.Your politique ſecretes gard with truſty loyalty.So ſhal they lurke in moſt aſſured ſecrecie.By Haſtinges death, and after fame ye learne,The earth for murther cryeth out vengeance ſterne.Flye from his faultes, and ſpare to hurt his fame.The eager houndes forbeare their ſlayne game.Dead, dead, auaunt Curres frō the conquered chaſe.Il mought he liue who loueth the dead to race.Thus liued this Lorde, thus died he, thus he ſlept.Mids forward race when firſt o reſt be ſtept,Enuious death that bounceth aſwel with maceAt Keyſars courtes, as at the pooreſt gates:Wheu Nature ſeemde to ſlow by this ſloape meane,Conueighed him ſooner to his liues extreame.Happie in preuenting woes that after happd,Ind ſlomber ſweete his liuing lights he lappd.Whoſe haſtye death, if it do anye greeue:Know hee, he lyued to dye, and dyed to lyue.Vntimelye neuer comes the liues laſt mette.In cradle death may rightly clayme his det.Straight after birth due is the fatal beere.By deathes permiſſion the aged linger here.Enen in the ſwathebandes out commiſſion goethTo looſe thy breath, that yet but youngly bloweth.Happy, thriſe happie, who ſo looſth his breath,That life he gayneth by his godly death.As Haſtinges here. Whom time and truth agree,To engraue by fame in ſtrong eternitie.Who ſpareth not ſpeaking, with daunger of his bloud?Yet loe this noble Lord did thinke it goodTo cleare the innocent not to ſpare to ſpeake,Although his ſhoulders with his bloud ſhould reake.Worthy to liue, who liued not for himſelfeBut priſed his fame more then this worldly pelfe.Whoſe name and line, if any yet preſerue,We wiſh they liue like honour to deſerue.Whether thou ſeeke by martiall proweſſe prayſe,Or Pallas pollicy high thy name to raiſe,Or truſty ſeruice honour to attaine:Haſtinges foreled. Tracke here his bloudy trayne.FINIS.Maiſter D.
WHen I had read this, one ſayd the admonition geuen in the hiſtory was profitable for the auoyding of the vices conteyned in ye ſayde hiſtorie, and for the imitating of the vertues in the ſame mentioned and commended. Then ſayd the reader: The next here whome I fynde miſerable, are king Edwardes two ſonnes, cruelly murdred in the Tower of London: Haue you theyr tragedy? No ſurely (ſaide I) The Lord Vaulx vndertoke to penne it, but what hee hath done therein I am not certayne, & therfore I let it paſſe, til I knowe further.

I haue heare the Duke of Buckingham, kinge Richards chiefe inſtrument, written by maiſter Thomas Sackuile. Reade it we praye you, ſayde they: with a good wil (quoth I) But firſt you ſhal heare his preface or induction. Hath hee made a preface (ſaide one) what meaneth he therby, ſeing none other hath vſed the like order? I wil tel you the cauſe thereof (ſaide I) which is this: After that hee vnderſtoode that ſome of the counſail would not ſuffer the booke to be printed in ſuche order as we had agreed and determined, he purpoſed to haue gotten at my hands, all the tragedies that were before the Duke of Buckinghams, which he would haue preſerued in one volume. And from y• time backwarde euen to the time of William the Conquerour, hee determined to continue and perfecte all the ſtorye  himſelfe, in ſuch order as Lydgate (folowing Bochas had already vſed. And therefore to make a meete Induction into the matter, hee deuiſed this poſie: which in my iudgement is ſo well penned, that I woulde not haue anye Verſe thereof, left out of our volume. Nowe that you knowe the cauſe and meaning of his doing, you ſhall heare alſo what hee hath done His Induction beginneth thus.

# THE INDVCTION,
THe wrathful winter proching on apace,With bluſtring blaſtes had al ybard the treen,And old Saturnus with his froſty face,With chilling cold had pearſt the tender greene:The mantles rent, wherein enwrapped beeneThe gladſome groaues that now lay ouerthrowne,The tapets torne and euery tree downe blowne.The ſoyle that earſt ſo ſeemely was to ſeeneWas al deſpoyled of her beauties hewe:And ſoote freſh flowers (wherewith the Somers queeneHad clad the earth) now Boreas blaſtes downe blewe.And ſmal foules flocking in their ſonges did rueThe winters wrath, wherewith ech thing defaſtIn woful wiſe bewayld the Somer paſt.Hawthorne had loſt his motley lyuerye,The naked twigs were ſhiuering all for cold:And dropping downe the teares abundauntly,Ech thing (me thought) with weeping eye me toldThe cruel ſeaſon, bidding me withholdMy ſelfe within for I was gotten outInto the fieldes whereas I walkt about.When lo the night with miſtie mantles ſpredGan darke the day, and dim the azure ſkies,And Venus in her meſſage Hermes ſpedTo bloudy Mars, to wil him not to riſe,While ſhe her ſelfe approacht in ſpeedy wiſe:And Virgo hyding her diſdainful breſtWith Thetis now had layd her downe to reſt.VVhiles Scorpio dreading Sagittarius dart,VVhoſe bow preſt bent in fight, the ſtring had ſlipt,Downe ſiyd into the Occean flud apart,The Beare that in the Iriſh ſeas had diptHis grieſly feete, with ſpeede from thence he whipt:For Thetis haſting from the Virgins bed.Purſued the Beare, that ere ſhe came was fled.And Phaton now nere reaching to his raceVVith gliſtring beames, gold ſtreaming where they bent,VVas preſt to enter in his reſting place.Erithius that in the cart firſt wentHad euen nowe attaind his iourneis ſtent.And faſt declining hid awaye his head,VVhile Titan coucht him in his purple bed.And pale Cinthea with her burowed lightBeginning to ſupplie her brothers place,Was paſt the Noone ſteede ſixe degrees in ſightWhen ſparkling ſtarres amid the heauens faceWith twinckling light ſhone on the earth apace,That while they brought about the nights chare,The darke had dimde the day ere I was ware.And ſorrowing I to ſee the Sommer flowers,The liuely greene, the luſty leaſe forlorne,The ſturdye trees ſo ſhattred with the ſhowers,The eloes ſo fade that floriſht ſo beforne,It taught me wel al earthly thinges be borneTo dye the death, for nought long time may laſt,The Sommers beautie yeldes to winters blaſt.Then looking vpward to the heauens leamesWith nights ſtars thicke powdred euery where,Which earſt ſo gliſtred with the golden ſtreamesThat chearful Phoebus ſpred downe from his Sphere,Beholding darke oppreſſing day ſo neare:The ſodaine ſight reduced to my minde,The ſundrie chaunges that in earth we finde.That muſing on this worldly wealth in thought,VVhich comes aud goes more faſter then we ſeeThe flickring flame that with the fyre is wrought▪My buſie minde preſented vnto meeSuch fal of Pieres as in the realme had be:That oft I wiſht ſome would their woes deſcriue,To warne the reſt whom Fortune left aliue.And ſtrait foorth ſtalking with redoubled paceFor that I ſaw the night drew on ſo faſt,In blacke al clad there fel before my faceA piteous might, whom wo had al forewaſt,Forth on her eyes the chriſtal teares foorth braſt.And ſighing ſore her handes ſhe wrong and fold,Tare al her hayre, that ruth was to behold.Her body ſmal forewichred and foreſpent,As is the ſtalke that Sommers drought oppreſt,Her wealked face with woful teares beſprent,Her colour pale, (as it ſeemed her beſt)In woe and plaint repoſed was her reſt.And as the ſtone that drops of water weares,So dented were her cheekes with fall of teareſſ.Her eyes ſwollen with flowing ſtreames a flote,Where with her lookes throwne vp ful piteouſlye,Her forceleſſe handes together oft ſhe ſmote,VVith doleful ſhrikes, that eckoed in the ſkie:VVhoſe plaint ſuch ſighes did ſtrait accompanie,That in my doome was neuer man did ſeA wight but halfe ſo wo begone as ſhee.I ſtoode agaſt beholding all her plight,Twene dread and dolour ſo diſtreinde in hart,That while my heares vpſtarted with the ſight,The teares out ſtreamde for ſorow of her ſmart:But when I ſaw no ende that could appartThe deadly dewle, which ſhe ſo ſore did make,VVith doleful voyce then thus to her I ſpake.Vnwrap thy woes what euer wight thou beeAnd ſtint in time to ſpil thy ſelfe with plaint,Tel what thou art, and whence: for wel I ſeeThou canſt not dure with ſorow thus attaint.And with that word of ſorow al forfaintShe looked vp, and proſtrate as ſhe layVVith piteous ſound o thus ſhe gan to ſay.Alas, I wretch whom thus thou ſeeſt diſtrenedVVith waſting woes, that neuer ſhal aſlake,Sorrow I am, in endleſſe tormentes payned,Among the furies in the infernal lake:VVhere Pluo God of Hel ſo grieſly blackeDoth hold his throne, and Laetheus deadly taſtDoth rieue remembraunce of ech thing forepaſt.VVhence come I am, the drery deſtenieAnd luckleſſe lot for to bemoane al thoſeVVhom Fortune in this maze of miſerieOf wretched chaunce moſt wofull myrrours choſeThat thou ſeeſt how lightly they did loſeTheir pome, their power, and that they thought moſt ſure,Thou maieſt ſone deeme no earthly ioy may dure.VVhoſe ruful vnice no ſoner had outbrayedThoſe woful wordes, wherewith ſhe ſorowed ſo,But out alas ſhe ſhrikt and neuer ſtayed,Fel downe, and all to baſht her ſelfe for wo.The cold pale dread my lims gan ouer goe,And I ſo ſorowed at her ſorowes eft,That what with griefe and feare my wits were reft.I ſtretcht my ſelfe, and ſtrait my hart reuiues,That dread and dolour erſt did ſo appale,Like him that with the feruent feuer ſiriuesWhen ſickneſſe ſeekes his caſtle health to ſkale:With gathred ſprites ſo forſt I feare to auale.And rearing her with anguiſh al foredone,My ſpirites returnde▪ and then I thus begone.O Sorow alas ſith ſorow is thy name,And that to thee this dreere doth wel pertaine.In vayne it were to ſeeke to ceaſe the ſame:But as a man himſelfe with ſorow ſlaine,So I alas do comfort thee in payne,That here in ſorow art forſoncke ſo diepeThat at thy ſight I can but ſighe and weepe.I had no ſooner ſpoken of a ſtikeBut that the ſtorme ſo rumbled in her breaſt,As Elus could neuer roare the like,And ſhowers downe rayned from her eyes ſo faſt.That al bedreint the place, til at the laſtVVell eaſed they the dolour of her minde.As rage of rayne doth ſwage the ſtormie winde.For forth ſhe paced in her feareful tale:Come, come, (quoth ſhee) and ſee what I ſhall ſhowe,Come heare the playning and the bitter baleOf worthy men, by Fortune ouerthrow.Come thou and ſee them rewing al in rowe.They were but ſhades that earſt in mynde thou rold.Come, come with me, thyne eyes ſhal them behold.What could theſe wordes but make me more agaſt?To heare her tel whereon I muſde while ere,So was I mazde therewith: til at the laſt,Muſing vpon her wordes, and what they were,Al ſodenlye wel leſſened was my feare:For to my minde retourned how ſhe teldBoth what ſhe was, and where her won ſhe held.Whereby I knew that ſhee a Goddeſſe was,And therewithal reſorted to my mindeMy thought, that late preſented me the glasOf brittle ſtate, of cares that here we finde.Of thouſand woes, to ſeely men aſſinde:And how ſhe now bid me come and beholdeTo ſee with eye that earſt in thought I rolde.Flat downe I fel, and with al reuerenceAdored her, perceiuing now that ſheeA Goddeſſe ſent by godlye prouidence,In earthly ſhape thus ſhowd her ſelfe to me,To wayle and rue this worlds certaintye:And while I honourd thus her Godheads might,With playning voyce theſe wordes to me ſhe ſhrightI ſhal the guide firſt to the grieſlye lake,And thence vnto the bliſful place of reſt.Where thou ſhalt ſee and heare ye plaint they make.That whilom here bare ſwinge among the beſt.This ſhalt thou ſee, but great is the vnreſtThat thou muſt byde before thou canſt attaineVnto the dreadful place where theſe remaine.And with theſe wordes as I vprayſed ſtode,And gan to folow her, that ſtraight forth paſte,Ere I was ware, into a deſert woodeWe now were come: where hand in hand embraſte,She led the way, and through the thicke ſo traſte,As but I had bene guided by her might,It was no way for any mortal wight.But loe, while thus amid the deſert darke,We paſſed on with ſteps and pace vnmeete:A rumbling roare confuſde with howle and harkeOf Dogs, ſhoke al the ground vnder our feete,And ſtroke the din within our eares ſo diepe,As halfe diſtraught vnto the ground I fel,Beſought returne, and not to viſite Hel.But ſhe forthwith vplifting me a paceRemoued my dread, and with a ſtedfaſt myndeBid me come on, for here now was the place,The place where we our trauaile end ſhould finde.Wherewith I roſe, and to the place aſſindeAſtoinde I ſtalke, when ſtraight we approached nereThe dreadful place, that you wil dread to here.An hydeous hole al vaſte, withouten ſhape,Of endleſſe depth, orewhelmde with ragged ſtone,With ouglye mouth, and grieſlye iawes doth gape,And to our ſight confounds it ſelfe in one.Here entred wee, and yeding forth, anoneAn horrible lothly lake we might diſcerneAs blacke as pitch, that cleped is Auern:A deadly gulfe where nought but rubbiſh grows,With fowle blacke ſwelth in thickned lumps yt lies,VVhich vp in thayre ſuch ſtinking vapors throwesThat ouer there, may flie no foule but dyes,Choakt with the peſtlent ſauours that ariſe.Hyther we come, whence foorth we ſtil did pace.In dreadful feare amid the dreadful place.And firſt within the porch and iawes of HelSate diepe Remorſe of conſcience, al beſprentWith teares: And to her ſelfe oft would ſhe tellHer wretchedneſſe, and curſing neuer ſtentTo ſob and ſighe: but euer thus lament,VVith thoughtful care, as ſhe that al in vayneWould weare and waſt continually in paine.Ier eyes vnſtedfaſt rolling here and there,Whurld on ech place, as place yt vengeance brought,So was her minde continually in feare,Toſſed and tormented with tedious thoughtOf thoſe deteſted crimes which ſhe had wrought:VVith dreadful cheare and lookes throwne to y• ſkieVViſhing for death, and yet ſhe could not dye.Next ſaw we Dread al trembling how ſhe ſhooke,VVith foote vncertaine profered here and there,Benumbd of ſpeach, and with a gaſtly lookeSearcht euery place al pale and dead for feare,His cap horne vp with ſtaring of his heare,Soynd and amazde at his owne ſhade for dread,And fearing greater daungers then was neede.And next within the entry of this lakeSate fell Reuenge gnaſhinge her teeth for ire,Deuiſinge meanes how ſhee may vengeaunce take,Neuer in reſt till ſhe haue her deſire:But frets within ſo farforth with the fierOf wreakinge flames, that now determine ſhse,To dye by death, or vengde by death to bee.When fell Reuenge with bloudy foule pretenceHad ſhowd her ſelfe as next in order ſet,With tremblinge Limmes wee ſoftly parted thence,Till in our eyes another ſight wee met:When fro my hart a ſigh forthwith I fetRewing alas vpon the wofull plightOf Miſery, that next appeard in ſight.His face was leaue, and ſomedeale pyned away,And eke his hande conſumed to the bone,But what his body was I cannot ſay,For on his Carkas rayment had he noneSaue Clouts, and Patches peeced one by one.With ſtaffe in hand, and Scrip on ſhoulder caſt,His chiefe defence againſt the Winters blaſt.His foode for moſt, was wild fruictes of the Tree,Vnleſſe ſometime ſome Crūmes fel to his ſhare:Which in his Wallet longe God wot kept hee,As on the which full dayntely would fareHis drincke the runninge ſtreame: his Cup, the bareOf his Palme cloſ'e, his Bed, the hard cold ground.To this Poore life was Myſery ybound.Whoſe wretched ſtate when wee had well beheldWith tender ruth on him, and on his ſeres,In thoughtfull cares, forth then our pace wee held.And by and by, another ſhape apperesOf greedy care, ſtill bruſhinge vp the breres,His Kckles knobbe, his Fleſh deepe dented in.With tawed hands, and hard ytanned Skin.The morrow gray no ſooner hath begonTo ſpreade his light euen peepinge in our eyes,VVhen he is vp, and to his worke yrn,But let the nights blacke miſty Mantles riſe,And with foule darke neuer ſo mutch diſguiſeThe Fayre bright day, yet ceaſſeth he no while,But hath his candels to prolonge his toyle.By him lay heauy ſleepe the Cooſin of deathFlat on the ground, and ſtill as any ſtone,A very Corps, ſaue yealdinge forth a breath,Small kepe toke he whom Fortune frowned onOr whom ſhe lifted vp into the TroueOf high renowne, but as a lyuinge death,So dead aliue, of life hee drew the breath.The bodies reſt, the quiet of the heart,The trauayles eaſe, the ſtill nights feare was hee,And of our life in earth the better part,Reuer of ſight, and yet in whom wee ſeeThings oft that tyde, and oft that neuer bee.VVithout reſpect eſteeminge equallyKinge Creſus pompe, and Irus Pouerty.And next in order ſad Olde age wee foundeHis Beard all hoare, his eyes hollow, and blind.VVith droupinge cheare ſtill poringe on the ground,As on the place where nature him aſſindTo reſt, when that the ſiſters had vntwindHis vitall thred, and ended with their KnifeThe fleetinge courſe of faſt declyninge lyfe.There heard wee him with broke, and hollow playntRewe wich himſelfe his ende approchinge faſt,And all for nought his wretched minde torment.VVyth ſweete remembraunce of his pleaſures paſt,And freſh delightes of luſty youth forewaſte.Recountinge which, how would hee ſoo and ſhrike:And to be yonge agayne of Ioue beſeeke.But and the cruell fates ſo fixed beeThat time forepaſt cannot retourne agayne,This one requeſt of Ioue yet prayed hee:That in ſutch withred plight, and wretched payne,As elde (accompanied with his lothſome trayne)Had brought on him, all were it woe, and griefe.Hee might a while yet linger forth his lief.And not ſo ſoone deſcend into the pit:VVhere death, when hee the mortall corps hath ſlayne,VVith retchleſſe hand in graue doth couer it,Thereafter neuer to enioy agayneThe gladſome light, but in the ground plaine,In depth of darkneſſe waſt, and weare to uought,As he had neuer into the word diu brought.But who had ſeene him ſobbinge, how he ſtoodeVnto himſelfe, and how he would beemoneHis youth forepaſt, as thought it wrought him goodTo talke of youth, all were his youth foregone,He would haue muſed, and maruayled mutch whereonThis wretched age ſhould life deſire ſo fayne,And knowes full well life doth but lenghth his payne.Crokebackt hee was, toothſhaken, and blere Eyed,Went on three feete, and ſomtime crept on foure,With olde lame Bones, that ratled by his ſyde,His ſcalpe all pild, and he with eld forlore:His withred fiſt ſtill knockinge at deathes doore,Fumblinge, and driuelinge as hee drawes his breath,For briefe the ſhape, and Meſſenger of death.And faſt by him pale malady was plaſte,Sore ſicke in Bed, her coulour all foregone,Bereft of Stomacke, Sauour, and of Taſte.Ne could the Brooke no meate but Broths alone,Her Breath corrupt, her Keepers euery oneAbborringe her, her Sickneſſe paſt recure,Deteſtinge Phiſicke, and all Phiſicks Cure.But oh the dolefull ſight that than wee ſee,Wee tourn'de our look, and on the other ſideA griefly ſhape of Famine mought wee ſee,With greedy lookes, and gapinge mouth that cryed,And roarde for meate, as ſhe ſhould there haue dyed,Her body ruinne, and bare as any Bone,Whereto was left nought but the caſe alone.And that alas was gnawen on euery where,All full of Holes, that I ne mought refraineFrom teares to ſee how ſhee her armes could teareAnd with her teeth gnaſh on the bones in vayne:When all for nought ſhee fayne would ſo ſuſtayneHer ſtaruen Corps, that rather ſeemde a ſhade,Then any ſubſtaunce of a creature made.Great was her force whom Stonewall could not ſtay,Her tearinge nayles ſnatchinge at all ſhee ſawe:With gapinge Iawes that by ne meanes ymayBee ſatiſfyed from hunger of her Mawe,But eates herſelfe as ſhee that hath no Lawe:Gnawinge alas her Carkas all in vayne,Where you may countech Sinow, Bone, and Vaine.On her while wee thus firmely fixt our Eyes,That bled for ruth of ſutch a drery ſight,Loe! ſodainly ſhee ſhright in ſo huge wiſe,As made Hell gates to ſhiuer with the might.VVherewith a Dart wee ſawe how it did light.Right on her breſt, and therewithall pale deathEnthrillinge it to reue her of her breath.And by and by a dumme dead Corps wee ſawe,Heauy and cold, the ſhape of death a

perforce muſt yelde vnto his Power.His dart anon out of his corps he toke,And in his hand (a dreadful ſight to ſee)With great triumphe eftſones the ſame he ſhoke,That moſt of al my feares affrayed mee:His body dight with nought but Bones perdyeThe naked ſhape of man there ſawe I plaine,All ſaue the Fleſh, the Sinow, and the Vayne.Laſtly ſtoode Warre in glitteringe armes yelad.VVyth Vyſage grim, Sterne lookes, and Blackly hewedIn his right Hand a naked Sword hee had,That to the Hilts was all with bloud embrued:And in his left (that Kinge, and Kingdomes rewed)Famine, and Fyer hee helde, and therewithallHee razed Townes, and threw downe Towers, and all.Citties hee Sackt, and Realmes that whilome flowred,In Honour, Glory, and rule aboue the beſt,Hee ouer whelm'de, and all their Fame deuoured,Conſum'de, deſtroy'de, waſted, and neuer ceaſt,Till hee their wealth, their name and all oppreſt.His Face forehewed with Wonoes, and by his ſyde,There hunge his Targe with gaſhes deepe, and wide.In mids of which, depaynted there wee foundeDeadly debate, all full of ſnaky heare,That with a bloudy fillet was yboude,Out breathinge nought but diſcord euery where.And round about were

towne ſo bent.I could not lin, but I muſt there lament.And that the more ſith deſteny was ſo ſterneAs force perforce, there might no force auayle,But ſhee muſt fall: and by her fall wee learne,That Citties, Towers, Wealth, World, and all ſhall quayle.No Manhoode, Might, nor nothinge mought preuayle,All were there Preſt, full many a Prince, and PeereAnd many a Knight that ſolde his death full deere.Nor worthy Hector worthieſt of them all,Her Hope, her Ioy, his Force is now for naught.O Troy, Troy, there is no boote but bale,The hugy Horſe within thy Wales is brought:Thy Turrets fall, thy

# The Complaynt of Henry Duke of Buckingham.
WHo truſts to mutch to honours higheſt throneAnd warely watch not ſlye Dame Fortunes ſnare:Or who in court will beare the ſwinge alone,And wiſely weigh not bow to wield the care,Beholde hee mee, and by my death beware:VVhom flatteringe Fortune falſely ſo begil'deThat lo ſhee ſlewe, where erſt full ſmoth ſhee ſmyl'de.And Sackuie ſith in purpoſe now thou haſtThe wofull fall of Princes to deſcriue,VVhom Fortune both vplift and eke downe caſt,To ſhewe thereby the vnſuerty in this life,Marke well my fall, which I ſhall ſhew beliue.And paint it forth that all Eſtates may knowe:Haue they the warninge, and bemine the woe,For Noble bloud made mee both Prince, and PeereYea Pearles too, had ſeaſon purchaſt place,And God with gifts endowed mee largely heare.But what auayles his giftes where fayles his grace?My Mothers ſire Spronge of a Kingly RaceAnd cald was Edmond Duke of Somerſet,Bereft of lyfe ere time by nature ſet.Whoſe faythfull heart to Henry ſixt ſo wroughtThat neuer bee him in weale, or woe forſooke,Till laſtly hee at Twkeſbury field was coughtWhere with an Axe his violent death hee tooke:Hee neuer could Kinge Edwards party brooke,Till by his death hee voucht that Quarrell good,In which his Sire, and Graundſire ſpilt their bloud.And ſutch was erſt my Fathers cruell chaunce,Of Stafford Earle by name that Humfrey hightWho euer Preſt did Henryes part Auaunce,And neuer ceaſt till at Saynct Albones fightHee loſt his lyfe, as than did many a Knight:Where eke my Graundſire, Duke of BuckinghamVVas wounded ſore, and hardly ſcapt vntane.But what may boote to ſtay the Siſters three?When Atropos perforce will cut the Thred:The dolefull day was come when you might ſeeNorthampton Field, with Armed men Oreſpred,Where Fate would algates haue my Graundſire dead:So ruſhinge forth amids the fierceſt fight,Hee liued, and died there in his Maiſters right.In place of whom as it befell my lot,Like on a ſtage, ſo ſtept I in ſtraiteway,Enioyinge there but wofully God wot,As hee that had a ſlender part to play:To teach thereby, in earth no ſtate may ſtay,But as our partes abridge or lengtht our ageSo paſſe wee all while others fill the ſtage.For of my ſelfe the drery fate to plaine.I was ſometime a Prince withouten peere,VVhen Edward fift began his rufull raygne,Ay mee, than I began that hatefull yeare,To compaſſe that which I haue bought ſo deare:I bare the ſwinge, I and that wretched wight,The Duke of Gloceſter that Richard hight.For when the fates had reft that Royall PrinceEdward the fourth, chiefe mirrour of that name,The Duke, and I faſt ioyned euer ſince,In faythfull loue, our ſecret driftes to frame:VVhat hee thought beſt, to mee ſo ſeem'de the ſame,My ſelfe not bent ſo mutch for to aſpire,As to fulfill that greedy Dukes deſire.VVhoſe reſtleſſe minde ſore thirſtinge after rule,VVhen that hee ſawe his nephewes both to beneThrough tender yeares as yet vnfit to rule,And rather ruled by their Mothers Kin,There ſought hee firſt his miſchiefe to begin,To plucke from them their Mothers frends aſſinde,For well he wiſt they would withſtand his mynde.To follow which hee ran ſo headlonge ſwift,Wyth eigre thirſt of his deſired draught,To ſeeke their deaths that ſought to daſh his drift,Of whom the chiefe the Queenes allies he thought,That bent thereto with mounts of miſchiefe fraughtHee knew their liues would be ſo ſore his let,That in their deaths his onely help hee ſet.And I moſt curſed caitife that I was,Seeinge the ſtate vnſted faſt howe it ſtoode,His chiefe complice to bringe the ſame to paſſe,Vnhappy wretch conſented to their blood:Yea Kinges, and Peeres that ſwim in worldly good,In ſeekinge bloud the ende aduert you playne,And ſee if bloud ey aſke not bloud agayne.Conſider Cyrus in your cruell thought,A makeleſſe Prince in riches, and in might,And weigh in minde the bloudy deedes hee wrought,In ſheadinge which hee ſet his whole delight:But ſee the guerdon lotted to this wight,Hee whoſe huge power no man might ouerthrowe,Tomyris Queene with great diſpite hath ſlowe.His head diſmembred from his mangled corps,Her ſelfe ſhee caſt into a veſſell fraughtVVyth clottred bloud of them that felt her force.And with theſe words a iuſt rewarde ſhe taught:Drinke now thy fill of thy deſired draught.Loe! Marke the fine that did this Prince be fall:Marke not this one, but marke the ende of all.Beholde Cambiſes, and his Fatall day,Where murders miſchiefe mirrour like is left:While bee his Brother Mergus caſt to ſlay,A dreadfull thinge his wits were him bereft.A Sword hee caught where with hee pearced eftHis body gored, which be of lyfe benooms:So iuſt is God in all his dredfulll dooms.O bloudy Brutus rightly didſt thou rewe,And thou Caſſius iuſtly came thy fall,That with the Sword wherewith thou Caeſar ſleweMurdreſt thy ſelfe, and reft thy life withall.A mirrour let him be vnto you allThat murderers be, of murder to your meede:For murder crieth out Vengeaunce on your ſeede.Loe! Beſſius he that arm'de with murderers Knife,And traytours heart againſt his royal King,With bloudy hands bereft his maiſters Lyfe,Aduert the fine his foule offence did bring:And loathinge murder as moſt lothly thingBeholde in him the iuſt deſerued fall,That euer hath, and ſhall betide them all.VVhat booted him his falſe vſurped raygne?VVhereto by murder he did ſo aſcend?VVhen like a wretch led in an yron chayneHee was preſented by his chiefeſt frendVnto the Foes of him whom he had ſlayne:That euen they ſhould venge ſo fowle a gilt,That rather ſought to haue his bloud yſpilt:Take bede ye Princes and ye prelates alOfſ this outrage, which though it ſleepe a whileAnd not diſcloſde, as it doth ſeeld be fal,Yet God that ſuffereth ſilence to beguileSuch giltes, wherewith both earth and ayre ye file,At laſt diſcries them to your foule deface,You ſee thexamples ſet before your face.And diepely graue within your ſtony hartes,The drery dewle that mighty Macedo,With feares vnfolded wrapt in deadly ſmartes,When he the Death of Clitus ſorowed ſo,Whom earſt he murdered with the deadly blowRaught in his rage vpon his frend ſo deare,For which behold lo how his pangues appeare,The launced ſpeare he writhes out of the wound,From which the purple bloud ſpins in his face:His heynous gilt when he returned found,He throwes himſelfe vpon the corps alas.And in his armes how oft doth he embraceHis murdred frend: and kiſſing him in vayne,Forth flowe the fluds of ſalt repentaunt rayne.His frendes amazde at ſuch a murder done,In feareful flockes begin to ſhrinke away.And he thereat with heapes of griefe for done.Hateth him ſelfe, wiſhing his later daye.Now he likewiſe perceiued in like ſtaye,As is the wilde beaſt in the deſert bred,Both dreading others and himſelfe abred.Hee calles for death, and loathinge lenger life,Bent to his Bane, refuſeth kindely Foode:And plung'de in depth of death, and dolours ſtrife,Had queld him ſelfe, had not his freendes withſtoode.Loe! he that thus hath ſhed the guiltleſſe bloud,Though hee were Kinge, and Kezar ouer allYet choſe he death to guerdon death withall.This Prince whoſe Peere was neuer vnder ſunneWhoſe gliſteringe Fame the Earth did ouerglyde,Which with his power welnigh the World had won,His bloudy handes himſelfe could not abyde,But fully bent with famine to haue died:The worthy Prince deemed in his regarde,That death for death could be but iuſt rewarde:Yet wee that were ſo drowned in the depthOf deepe deſire to drinke the guiltleſſe bloud,Like to the Wolfe, with greedy lookes that epthInto the Snare, to feede on deadly Foode,So wee delighted in the State wee ſtoode,Blinded ſo farre in all our blinded TrayneThat blinde wee ſawe not our deſtruction playne.Wee ſpared none whoſe life could ought for letOur wicked purpoſe to his paſſe to come.Fower worthy Kinghtes wee Headed at PomfretGuiltleſſe (God wote) withouten lawe or dome.My heart euen bleedes to tell you all and ſome,And how Lord Haſtings when hee feared leaſt,Diſpiteouſly was murdred, and oppreſt.Theſe rocks vpraught, that threatned moſt our wreckeVVee ſeem'de to ſayle mutch ſurer in the Streame:And fortune faringe as ſhee were at beckeLay'de in our lap the rule of all the Realme.The Nephewes ſtrait depoſ'de were by the Eame.And wee aduaunſt to that wee bought full deere,Hee Crowned Kinge, and I his chiefeſt Peere.Thus hauinge wonne our longe deſired Pray,To make him Kinge that ee might make mee chiefe,Downe throwe wee ſtrait his ſely Nephewes tway,From Princes Pompe, to wofull Priſoners lyfe:In hope that nowe ſtint was all furder ſtrife.Sith hee was Kinge, and I chiefe ſtroke did beare.Who ioyed but wee, yet who more cauſe to feare?The guiltleſſe bloud which wee vniuſtly ſhed,The Royall Babes deueſted from their Trons,And wee like Traytours raigninge in their ſted,Theſe heauy Burdens paſſed vs vpon,Tormentinge vs ſo by our ſelues alone,Mutch like the Felon that purſued by night,Starts at ech Buſh, as his Foe were in ſight.Nowe doubtinge State, now dreadinge loſſe of lyfe,In feare of wracke at euery blaſt of Winde,Now ſtart in Dreames through dread of murdrers knyfe,As though euen then reuengement were aſſinde.With reſtleſſe thought ſo is the guilty mindeTurmoylde, and neuer feeleth eaſe, or ſtay,But liues in feare of that which followes aye.Well gaue that Iudge his dome vpon the deathOf Titus Glelius that in Bed was ſlayne:Whan euery wight the cruell murder leythTo his two Sonnes that in his Chamber layne,That Iudge that by the proofe perceiueth playne,That they were founde faſt ſleepinge in their Bed,Hath deem'de them guiltleſſe of this bloud yſhed.He thought it could not be, that they which brakeThe lawes of God and man in ſutch outrageCould ſo forthwith themſelues to ſleepe betake:He rather thought the horrour, and the rageOf ſutch an haynous gilt, could neuer ſwage.Nor neuer ſuffer them to ſleepe, or reſt,Or dreadles breath one breath out of their breſt.So gnawes the greife of conſcience euermoreAnd in the heart it is ſo deepely graue,That they may neyther ſleepe nor reſt therefore,Ne thinke one thought, but on the dread they haue.Still to the death for toſſed with the waueOf reſtleſſe woe, in terrour, and diſpeire.They leade a life continually in feare.Lyke to the Deare that ſtriken with the Dart,With drawes himſelfe into ſome ſecrete place,And feelinge greene the wounde about his hart,Startleſſe with pangs till hee fall on the graſſe,And in great feare lies gaſpinge there a ſpace,Forth brayinge Sigbes as though ech pange had broughtThe preſent death which hee doth dread ſo oft:So wee diepe wovnded with the bloudy thought,And gnawing worme that grieued our conſciens ſo,Neuer tooke eaſe, but as our hart outhroughtThe ſtayned ſighes in witneſſe of our woe,Such reſtleſſe cares our fault did wel beknowe:Wherewith of our deſerued fal the fearesIn euery place rang death within our eares.And as il grayne is neuer wel ykept,So fared it by vs within a while:That which ſo long with ſuch vnreſt we reapt,In dread and daunger by al wit and wyle,Loe ſee the fyne, when once it felt the wheeleOf ſipper fortune, ſtay it mought no ſtowne,The wheele whurls vp, but ſtrait it whurleth down.For hauing rule and riches in our hand,Who durſt gainſay the thing that we auerde?Will was wiſedome, our luſt for lawe did ſtand,In ſort ſo ſtraunge that who was not afeardWhen he the ſound but of king Richard heard?So hateful waxt the hearing of his nameThat you may deeme the reſidue of the ſame.But what auaild the terrour and the feare,Wherewith he kept his lieges vnder awe?It rather wan him hatred euery where.And fayned faces forſt by feare of lawe:That but while Fortune doth with fauour blawFlatter through feare: for in their harte lurkes ayeA ſecrete hate that hopeth for a daye.Recordeth Dionyſius the Kynge,That with his Rigour ſo his Realme oppreſt,As that he thought by cruel feare to bringeHis Subiects vnder, as him liked beſt:But loe! the dread where with himſelfe was ſtreſt,And you ſhall ſee the fine of forced feare,Moſt myrrour like in this proude Prince appeare.All were his Head with Crowne of Golde yſprad,And in his Hand the Royall Scepter ſet:And hee with Princely Purple richly clad,Yet was his heart with wretched cares orefret:And in wardly with deadly feare beſet,Of thoſe whom hee by Rigour kept in awe,And ſore oppreſt with might of Tyraunts Lawe.Agaynſt whoſe feare, no heapes of Golde, and glie,No ſtrength of gard, nor all his hired power,Ne proude high Towers that preaced to the Skie,His cruell heart of ſafty could aſſure:But dreadinge them whom hee ſhould deeme moſt ſure,Himſelfe his Beard with burninge Brand would ceare,Of death deſeru'de ſo vexed him the feare.This might ſuffiſe to repreſent the fineOf Tyraunts force, their feares, and their vnreſt,But heare this one, although my heart repineTo let the ſound once ſincke within my breſt:Of fell Phereus, that aboue the reſt,Sutch lothſome cruelty on his people wrought▪As (oh alas) I tremble with the thought.Some hee encaſed in the Coates of Bears,Amonge Wilde beaſts deuoured ſo to bee:And ſome for Pray vnto the Hunters Speares,Like Sauage Beaſts withouten ruth to dye.Sometime to encreaſe his horrible cruelty,The quicke with face to face engraued hee,Ech others death that ech mought liuinge ſee.Loe! what more cruell horrour mought bee found,To purchaſe feare, if feare could ſtay his raygne?It ooted not, it rather ſtrake the woundeOf feare in him to feare the like agayne.And ſo he did full oft, and not in vayne:And in his life his cares could witneſſe well▪But moſt of all his wretched ende doth tell.His owne deare Wyfe whom as his life hee loued,Hee durſt not truſt, nor proch vnto her Bed,But cauſinge firſt his Slaue with naked SwordeTo go before, himſelfe with tremblinge dreadStrayt followeth faſt, and whurlinge in his headHis rollinge eyen, hee ſearcheth heere, and thereThe deepe daunger that hee ſo ſore did feare.For not in vayne it ran ſtill in his Breaſt,Some wretched hap ſhould hale him to his ende.And therefore alway by his pillow preſtHad hee a Sword, and with that Sword bee wende,In vayne (God wote) all perils to defende.For loe! his Wife foreyrked of his Raygne,Sleepinge in Bed this cruell Wrech hath Slayne.VVhat ſhould I more now ſeeke to ſay in thisOr one iote farder linger foorth my Tale?VVyth cruell Nero, or with Phalaris,Caligula, Domitian, and allThe cruell Rout? or of their wretched fall?I can no more, but in my name aduertAll earthly powers beware of Tyrants heart.And as our State endured but a throw,So beſt in vs the ſtay of ſutch a StateMy beſt appeare to hange on ouer throw,And better teach Tyraunts deſerued hateThan any Tyraunts death tofore, or late.So cruell ſeem'd this Richard third to mee,That loe! my ſelfe now loath'de his crueltee.For when alas, I ſawe the Tyraunt KingeContent not onely from his Nephues twayneTo riue Worlds bliſſe, but alſo al Worlds beinge,Saunce earthly guilt ycauſinge both be ſlyne,My hart agrief'de that ſutch a wretch ſhould raygne,VVhoſe bloudy breſt ſo ſaluaged out of kinde,That Phalaris had neuer ſo bloudy a minde.Ne could I brooke him once within my breaſt,But with the thought my Teeth would gnaſhe wtal:For toough I earſt were his by ſworne beheſt,Yet when I ſawe miſchiefe on miſchiefe fall,So deepe in bloud to murther Prince, and allAy then thought I, alas, and weale away,And to my ſelfe thus mourninge would I ſay.If neyther Loue, Kinred, ne knot of Bloude,His owne alleageaunce to his Prince of due,Nor yet the State of truſt wherein hee ſtoode,The Worlds defame, nor nought could forme him trueThoſe guiltleſſe Babes, could they no make him rue?Nor could their youth, nor innocence withallMoue him from reuiage them their life, and all?Alas it could not moue him any iote,Ne make him once to rue or wet his eye,Stird him no more than that that ſtirreth not:But as the rocke or ſtone that wil not plye,S was his hart made hard with crueltye,To murther them, alas I weepe in thought,To thincke on that which this fell wreth hath wrought.That now when he had done the thing he ſought,And as he would, compliſht and compaſt all,And ſawe and knewe the treaſon he had wroughtTo God and man, to ſtay his Prince and all,Then ſeemde he firſt to doubt and dread vs all,And me in chief, whoſe death all meanes he mightHe ſought to worke by malice and by might.Such heapes of harmes vpharbard in his breſtWith enuious hart my honour to deface,And knowing he that I tch woted beſtHis wretched drts, and all his wretched caſe,If euer ſprang within me ſparke of grace,Muſt needes abhorre him and his hateful race:Now more and more can caſt me out of grace.Which ſodaine chaunge when I by ſecret chaunceHad wel perceiued by proofe of enuious frowne,And ſaw the lot that did me to aduaunceHim to a king that ſought to caſt me downe,To late it was to linger any ſtowne:Sith preſent choiſe lay caſt before myne eye,To worke his death, or I my ſelfe to dye.And as the knight in field among his foes,Beſet with ſwordes, muſt ſlaye or there be ſlayne:So I alas lapd in a thouſand woes,Beholding death on euery ſyde ſo playne,I rather choſe by ſome ſlye ſecret traineTo worke his death, and I to liue thereby,Than he to liue and I of force to dye.With heauy choiſe ſo haſtned me to chooſe,That I in part agrieued at his diſdaine,In part to wreake the doleful death of thoſeTwo render Babes, his ſeely Nephues twayne,By him alas commaunded to be ſlayne,With painted cheae humblye before his face,Straight toke my leaue & rode to Brecknocke placeAnd there as cloſe and couert as I might,My purpoſe practiſe to his paſſe to bring,In ſecret driftes I lingered day and night:Al how I might depoſe this cruel king,That ſeemde to all ſo much a deſyrd thing,As thereto truſting I empriſde the ſame:But too much truſting brought me to my bane.For while I now had Fortune at my beckeMiſtruſting I no earthly thing at all,Vnwares alas leaſt looking for a checke,She mated me in tourning of a ball:When leaſt I feared, the neareſt was my fall.And when whole hoaſtes were preſt to ſtry my foen.She chaungde her cheare, and left me poſt alone.I had vpraiſde a mighty hand of men,And marched foorth in order of array.Leading my power amid the foreſt Dene,Againſt the tyraunt banner to diſplaye:But lo my Souldiers cowardly ſhranke awaye,For ſuch is Fortune when ſhe liſt to frowne,Who ſeemes moſt ſure, him ſoneſt whurls ſhe downO let no Prince put truſt in commontie,Nor hope in faith of giddie peoples minde,But let al noble men take heede by mee,That by the proofe to wel the payne do fynde:Lo, where is truth or truſt? or what could bindeThe vayne people, but they wil ſwerue and ſwaye,As chaunce bringes chaunge, to driue & draw yt way.Rome thou that once aduaunced vp ſo hye,Thy ſtay, patron, and flower of excellence,Haſt now throwne him to depth of miſerie,Exiled him that was thy whole defence,Ne compreſt it not an horrible offence,To reeuen him of honour and of fame,That wan it thee when thou hadſt loſt the ſame.Behold Camillus, he that earſt reuiuedThe ſtate of Rome, that dyinge he did fynde,Of his owne ſtate is now alas depriued,Baniſht by them whom be did thus det bynde:That cruel folke vnthankeful and vnkinde,Declared wel their falſe inconſtancie,And fortune eke her mutabilitie.And thou Scipio, a mirrour maieſt thou heTo al nobles, that they learne not to late,How they once truſt the vnſtable commontie.That thou recuredſt the torne diſmembred ſtate,Euen when the conqueror was at the gate,At now exilde, as though thou not deſeruedTo reſt in her, whom thou hadſt ſo preſerued.Ingrateful Rome haſt ſhewed thy crueltie,No him, by whom thou liueſt yet in fame.But nor thy deede, nor his deſert ſhal dye,But his owne words ſhal witneſſe aye the ſame:For lo his graue doth thee moſt iuſtlye blame.And with diſdaine in Marble ſayes to thee:Vnkinde countrey my bones ſhalt thou not ſee.What more vnworthye than this his exile?More iuſt than this the woful plaint he wrote?Or who could ſhew a playner proofe the while,Of moſt falſe faith, than they thus forgotHis great deſertes? that ſo deſerued not?His cinders yet lo, doth he them denye,That him denied amongſt them for to dye.Melciades, O happy hadſt thou bee,And well rewarded of thy Country men,If in the Field when thou hadſt forſt to flyeBy thy proweſſe, three hundred thouſand men,Content they had bin to Exile thee then:And not to caſt thee into Priſon ſo,Laden with Gyues to ende thy life in woe.Alas how hard, and Steely hearts had theyThat not contented there to haue thee dye,VVyth fettred Gyues in Priſon where thou lay,Increaſt ſo farre in hatefull Cruelty,That burial to thy Corps, they eke deny:Ne will they graunt the ſame, till thy Sonne

Hanniball as longe as fixed fate,And brittle Fortune had ordayned ſo,Who euermore aduaunſt his Countrey ſtateThen thou that liuedſt for her, and for no moe?But when the ſtormy Waues began to growe,VVithout reſpect of thy deſerts ere while,Art by thy Countrey throwen into Exile.Vnfrendly Fortune ſhall I thee now blame?Or ſhall I fault the ſates that ſo ordayne?Or art thou Ioue the cauſer of the ſame?Or cruelty her ſelfe doth ſhee conſtrayne?Or on whom els alas ſhall I complayne?O truſtleſſe world I can accuſen none,But fickle fayth of Commonty alone.The Polipus nor the Chamelion ſtraunge,That tourne themſelues to euery hue they ſeeAre hot ſo ful of vayne and fickle chaungeAs is this falſe vnſtedfaſt commontie.Loe I alas with mine aduerſitieHaue tried it true, for they are

I loſt:And with theſe wordes as if the axe euen thereDiſmembred had his head and corps apart,Dead fel he downe and wee in woful feareStoode mazed when he would to life reuert:But deadly griefe ſtil grew about his hart,That ſtil he Iry, ſomtime reuiued with payne,And with a ſighe becomming dead againe,Midnight was come, when euery vital thingWith ſweete ſound ſleepe their weary lims did reſt,The beaſtes were ſtil, the little birdes that ſing▪Now ſweetely ſlept beſides their mothers breſt:The old and al were ſhrouded in their neſt.The waters calme, the cruel ſeas did ceaſe,The woods, the fieldes, & al thinges held their peaceThe golden ſtars were whirld amid their race,And on the earth old laugh with twinckling light,When ech thing neſtled in his reſting place,Forgat dayes payne with pleaſure of the night:The hare had not the greedy boundes in ſight,The fearful Deare of death ſtoode not in doubt,The Partridge drept not of the Falcons foote.The ouglye Beare now minded not the ſtake,Nor how the cruel maſtiues do him teare,The ſtag lay ſtil vnrouſed from the brake,The fomye bore fearde not the hunters ſpeate:Al thing was ſtil in deſert buſh and breare.With quiet hart now from their trauayles reſt.Soundly they ſlept in midſt of al their reſt.When Buckingham amid this plaint oppreſt,VVith ſurging ſorowes and with pinching painesIn ſort thus ſowned, and with a ſigh e

panges that he aſſaied,And he ſo ſore with ruful rage diſtraught.To thinke vpon the wretch that him betraiedVVhom earſt he made a Gentleman of noughtThat more and more agreeued was his thought,He ſtormes out ſighes, and with redoubled ſore,Stroke with the furies rageth more and more.Who ſo hath ſeene the Bull chaſed with daries,And with deepe wounds foregalde and gored ſo,Til he oppreſſed with the deadly ſmartes,Fl in arage and runne vpon his foe,Let him I ſay behold the raging woeOf Buckingham that in theſe gripes of griefeRageth gainſt him that hath betraied his life.With bloud red eyen he ſtareth here and there,Frothing at mouth, with face as pale as clout:When loe my lims were trembling all for feare,And I amazde ſtoode ſtil in dreadn ad doubt,While I mought ſee him throwe his armes about:And gainſt the groūd himſelfe plundge wt ſuch forceAs if the life ſorth with ſhould leaue the corps.With ſmoake of ſighes ſometime I might beholdeThe place al dimde, like to the morning

if the crone of mighty Ioue ſhould rent,And I the while with ſprites welny bereft,Beheld the plight and pangues that did him ſtraine.And how the bloud his deadly colour left,And ſtaight returnd with flaming red againe:When ſodenlye amio his raging payne,He gaue a ſighe and with that ſigh he ſaied,Oh Banaſtar, and ſtraight againe he ſtaied.Dead laye his corps as dead as any ſtone,Til ſwelling

not death deliuer thee ſo ſoneOut of thy woes, ſo happye ſhalt thou not bee:But to the eternal Ioue this is my boone,That thou maieſt liue thine eldeſt ſonne to ſee,Reft of his wyts, and in a fowle Bores StyeTo end his dayes in rage and death diſtreſt,A worthy tombe where one of thine ſhould reſt.Yet after this, yet pray I more thou mayThy ſecond ſonne ſee drowned in a dyke,And in ſuch ſort to cloſe his later daye,As hearde or ſeene erſt hath not beene the like:Yſtrangled in a puddle not halfe ſo diepeAs halfe a foote, that ſuch hard loſſe of lyfe,So cruelly chaunſt, may be the greater griefe.And not yet ſhal thy huge ſorowes ceaſſe,Ioue ſhall not ſo withhold his wrath fro thee,But that thy plagues may more and more encreaſe,Thou ſhalt ſtil liue that thou thy ſelfe ſhalt ſeeThy deare daughter ſtroken with leproſye:That ſhee that earſt was al thy whole delight,That now maiſt loathe to haue her come in ſight.And after that let ſhame and ſorowes griefFeede foorth thy yeares continuallye in woe,That thou maiſt liue in death, and dye in life,And in this ſort forewaild and weried ſo,At length thy ghoſt to part thy body fro:This pray I Ioue, and with this later breath,Vengeaunce I aſke vpon my cruel death.This ſayd he flong his rechles armes abroade,And groueling flat vpon the ground he lay,Which with his teeth he al to gnaſht and gnawde:Deepe groanes he fet, as he that would away,But loe in vayne he did the death aſſaye:Although I thinke was neuer man that knew,Such deadly paynes, where death did not enſue.So ſtroue he thus awhile as with the death,Now pale as lead and cold as any ſtone.Now ſtil as calme, now ſtorming forth a breath.Of ſmoakie ſighes, as breath and al were gone:But euery thing hath end: ſo he anoneCame to himſelfe when with a ſigh outbrayed,With woful cheare, theſe woful wordes he ſayd.Ah, where am I, what thing, or whence is this?Who reft my wits? or how do I thus lye?My lims do quake, my thought agaſted is,Why ſigh I ſo? or whereunto do IThus grawle on the ground? and by and byVpraiſde he ſtoode, and with a ſighe hath ſtaide,When to himſelfe returned thus he ſayde.Suffiſeth now this plaint and this regreete,Whereof my hart his boccome hath vnfraught:And of my death let Pieres and princes weeteThe Worlds vntruſt, that they there by be taught.And in her wealth, ſith that ſuch chaunge is wrought,Hope not too much, but in the midſt of alThinke on my death, and what may them befall.So long as Fortune would permit the ſame,I liued in rule and riches with the beſt:And paſt my time in honour and in fame.That of Miſhap no feare was in my breaſt:But falſe Fortune when I ſuſpected leaſt,Did tourne the wheele, and wich a doleful fallHath me bereft of honour life and all.Loe what auayles in ryches flouds that flowes?Though ſhe ſo ſmylde as al the world were his?Euen kinges and Keſars biden Fortunes throwes,And ſimple ſore muſt beare it as it is.Take heede by me that blithde in baleful bliſſe:My rule, my ryches, royal bloud and al,When Fortune fround, the feller made my fall.For hard miſhaps that happens vnto ſuch,Whoſe wretched ſtate erſt neuer fell no chaunge,Agrieue them not in any part ſo much,As their diſtreſſe to whom it is ſo ſtraunge,That al their liues nay paſſed pleaſures raunge:Their ſoden woe that aye wield wealth at will,Algates their hartes more pearcinglye muſt thril.For of my byrth, my bloud was of the beſt,Firſt borne an Earle, then Duke by due diſcent:To ſwing the ſway in Court among the reſt,Dame Fortune me her rule moſt largely lent:And kinde courage ſo my corps had blent,That loe on whom but me did ſhe moſt ſmyle?And whom but me loe, did ſhe moſt beguile?Now haſt thou hard the whole of my miſhapMy chaunce, my chaunge, the cauſe of al my care:In wealth and woe, how fortune id me wrap,With world at wil to winne me to her ſnare,Bid kinges, bid Keſars, did al ſtates beware,And tel them this from mee that tryed it true.Who reckleſſe rules, right ſoone may hap to rue.FINIS.T.

HOw like you this my maiſters (quoth I) very wel ſayd one: the tragedy excelleth: ye inuention alſo of the Induction, and yt deſcriptions, are notable. But whereas he fayneth to talke with the Princes in Hel, that I am ſure wyl be miſliked, becauſe it is moſt certaine, that ſome of their ſoules be in heauen. And although he herein, do folow allowed Poets, in their deſcription of hel, yet it ſauoreth ſo much of Purgatorie, whiche the Papiſtes haue digged thereout, that the ignoraunt may thereby bee deceiued. Not a whit I warrant you ſayd one: for hee meaneth not by his hel y• place either of damned ſoules, or of ſuche as lye for their fees, but rather the graue, wherin ye dead bodies of al ſortes of people do reſt til time of the reſurrectiō. And in this ſence is Hell taken often in the Scriptures, and in the writinges of learned Chriſtians, & ſo wold haue it taken. Tuſh (quoth another) what ſtand we hereupon? it is a Poeſy and no deuinitye,  and it is lawful for Poetes to fayne what they lyſt ſo it be appertinent to the matter: And therfore let it paſſe euen in ſuch ſort as you haue read it. Wyth a good wil (quoth I) But whereas you ſay a Poet may ſayne what he liſt: in dede me thinke it ſhould be ſo, & ought to be wel taken of the hearers: But it hath not at al times bene ſo allowed: ye ſay troth quoth the Reader: For here foloweth in the ſtorye that after the death of this duke, one called Colling bourne, was cruellye put to death for makinge of a tyme. I haue his tragedie here (ſaid I) For the better perceiuing whereof, you muſt imagin that you ſee him a mcilous wel ſauoured man, holdinge in his hand his owne hart, new lie ripped out of his breaſt, & ſmoaking out the lyuely ſpirite: & with hys hand, beckning too and fro, as it were to warne vs to auoyd: and with his faynt tongue, & voyce ſaying as couragiouſlye as he may theſe wordes that follow.

# How Collingbourn was cruelly executed, for making a fooliſh Ryme.
BEware, take heede, take heede, beware, bewareYou Poetes you, that purpoſe to rehearceBy any arte what tyrauntes doinges are,Erinnis rage is growen ſo fel and fearceThat vicious actes may not be toucht in verſe,The Muſes freedome, graunted them of elde,Is bard, lie reaſons treaſons hie are helde.Be rough in ryme, and then they ſay you rayle,As luuenal was, but that makes no matter:With Ieremie you ſhalbe had to iayle,Or forſt with Martial, Caeſars faultes to flatter,Clarkes muſt be taught to clawe and not to clatter:Free Hellicon, and francke Parnaſſus hylls.Are hellye haunts, and rancke pernicious ills.Touch couertlye in fermes, and then you tauntThough prayſed Poetes, alway did the like,Controll vs not, els traytour vile auaunt,What paſſe we what the learned do miſlike?Our ſinnes we ſee, wherein to ſwarme we ſeeke.We paſſe not what the people ſay or thinke,Their ſhittle hate maketh none but cowardes ſhrinke.We know (ſay they) the courſe of Fortunes wheele,How conſtantly it whirleth ſtil about,Arrearing now, while elder headlong reele.How al the ryders alway hang in doubt.But what for that we count him but a louteThat ſticks to mount, and baſely like a beaſtLiues temperately for feare of Blockham feaſt.Indeede we would of al bee deemed GodsWhat euer we doe: and therfore partelye hateRude preachers that dare threaten vs plagues and rods,And blaſe the blots whereby we ſtaine our ſtate:But nought we paſſe what any ſuch do prate.Of courſe and office they muſt ſay their pleaſure,And wee of courſe muſt heare and mend at leyſure.But when theſe pelcing Poetes in their rimesShal taunt, or leaſt, or pai our wicked workes,And cauſe the people know and curſe our crimes,This ougly fault, no tyraunt liues but vrkes.Wherfore we loath ſuch aunters worſe than Turkes,Whoſe meaning is to make vs know our miſſe,And ſo to mend, but they but doate in this.We know our faultes as wel as any other,We alſo doubt the daungers for them due,Yet ſtil we truſt ſo right to guyde the other,That ſcape we ſhal the ſourges that enſue.We thinke we know mo ſhiftes than other knew.In vaine therfore for vs are counſailes writ:We know our faultes and wil not mend a whit.Theſe are the feaes of the vnhappye ſort,That preace for honours, wealth, and pleaſure vaine.Ceaſſe therfore Baldwin, ceaſſe I thee exhort,Withdraw thy pen, for nothing ſhalt thou gaineSaue hate, with loſſe of paper, ynke and paine.Few hate their faultes, al bate of them to heareAnd fautieſt, from fault would ſeme moſt cleare.Thy entent I know is honeſt, plaine, and good,To warne the wiſe, to fray the fond fro ill:But wicked worldlings are ſo witleſſe wood.That to the worſt they all thinges conſtrue ſtil.With rigour oft they recompence good wyll:They racke the wordes til time their ſinowes burſt,In doubtful ſences, ſtrayning ſtil the worſt.A painful proofe taught me the truth of this,Through tyrauntes rage, and Fortunes cruel tourne:They murdred me, for meetring thinges amiſſe.For wotſt thou what? I am that Colling bourneWhich made the ryme, whereof I wel may mourne.The Cat, the Rat, and Louel our Dog,Do rule al England vnder a Hog,Whereof the meaning was ſo plaine and true,That euery foole perceiued it at furſt:Moſt liked it, for moſt that moſt thinges knewe,In hugger mugger, muttred what they durſt.The tyraunt prince of moſt was held accurſt,Both for his owne and for his counſels faultes,Of whom was three the naughtieſt of al naughts.Cateſbye was one whome I called a Cat,A craftie lawyer catching all be could.The ſecond Ratcliffe, whom I named a Rat,A cruel beaſt to gnaw on whom e ſhould.Lord Louel barckt and bye whom Richard would,Whom I therfore did rightly terme our Dog,Wherewith to ryme, I cald the king a Hog.Til he the crowne had caught he gaue the Bore,In which eſtate would God he had deceaſed,Then had the realme not ruined ſo ſore.His Nephues raigne ſhould not ſo ſone haue ceaſſed,The noble bloud had not bene ſo decreaſed.His Rat, his Cat, and Bloudhound had not noyedSuch liegemen true, as after they deſtroyed.Their lawleſſe actes, good ſubiectes did lament,And ſo did I, and therfore made the rimesTo ſhow my wit how wel I could inuent,To warne withal the careleſſe of their crimes,I thought the freedome of the auncient timesStoode ſtil in force. Ridentem dicere verumQuis veta? Nay nay, Veritas eſt peſſimarerum.Belike no tyrauntes were in Horace dayes,And therefore Poets freely blamed vice,VVitneſſe their Satyres ſharpe, and tragicke plaies,VVith chiefeſt Princes chieflye had in price.They name no man they mixe their gall with ſpice,No more doe I▪ I name no man out right,But riddle wiſe, I meane them as I might.VVhen brute had brought this to their guiltie eares,VVhoſe right ſurnames were noted in the ryme,They al conſpyred like moſt greedy eares,To charge me ſtraight with this moſt greuous crime:And dampned me the Galow tree to clime,And then ſtrangled, in quarters to be cut,VVhich ſhoud on high ouer London Gates be put.This iudgement geeuen ſo vehement and ſo ſoreMade me exclaime againſt their tyrannye.VVhere with encenſt, to make my payne the more,They practiſed a ſhameful vylanie:They cut me downe aliue and cruelly,Ript vp my paunch and bulke to make me ſmart,And lingered long ere they tooke out my hart.Here tyraunt Richard plaied the eager Hog,His graſhing tuſkes my tender griſtles ſhore:His bloud bound Louel playde the rauening Dog,His muluiſh teeth, my guiltleſſe carkaſſe tore:His Rat, and Cat, did what they might, and more,Cat Cateſy clawed my guts to make me ſmart,The Rat Racliffe gnawed mee to the hart.If Iewes had kild the iuſteſt king aliue,If Turkes had burnt vp Churches, Gods, and al,What greater payne could cruel hartes contriue,Than that I ſuffred, for this treſpaſſe ſmall?I was no Prince nor Pier, but yet my falIs worthy to be thought vpon for this,To ſee how cankard tyrantes mallice is.To teach alſo al ſubiecte to take heedeThey meddle not with magiſtrates affaires,But pray to God to mend them if they neede:To warne alſo al Poetee that he ſtrayers,To keepe them cloſe in rompaſſe of their chayres,And whan they touch that they would wiſh amended,To ſauſe them ſo, that ſewe nede be offended.And ſo to mixe their ſharpe rebukes with mirth,That they may pearce, not cauſing any paine,Saue ſuch as foloweth euerye kindely birth,Requied ſtraight, with gladneſſe of the gayne.A Poet muſt be pleaſaune, not to plaine,Faultes to control, ne yet to flatter viceBut ſound and ſweete, in al thinges ware and wiſe.The Grekes no paint a Poetes office wholeIn Pegaſus, their fayned horſe with winges,Whom ſhaped ſo Meduſaes bloud did foale,Who with his feee ſtrake out the Muſes ſpringesFro flintie rockes to Hellicon that clinges.And then flew vp into the ſtarrie ſkie,And there abides among the Gods  hye,For hee that ſhal a perfect Poet be,Muſt firſt be bred out of Meduſaes bloud:He muſt be chaſt and vertuous as was ſhee,Who to her power the Occean God withſtoode,To thend alſo hiſſ doome be iuſt and goad,Ie muſt (as ſhee) looke rightlye wih one eyeTruth to regard  write nothing awrie,In courage eke he muſt bee like a horſe,He may not feare to regiſter the right.VVhat though ſome frowne, thereof be may not force,No bit nor reine his tender iawes may twight.He muſt be armde with ſtrength of wit and ſprite.To daſh the rockes, darke cauſes and obſcure,Til he attaine the ſpringes of truth moſt pure.His hooues alſo muſt pliaunt be and ſtrong,To riue the rockes of luſt and errors blinde,In brainleſſe heades, that alway wander wrong:Teſe muſt he briſe with reaſons plaine and kinde,Til ſpringes of grace do guſh out of the minde,For il affections from the fond be driuen,In vayne is truth told, or good counſel geeuen.Like Pegaſus a Poet muſt haue winges,To flie to heauen or where him liketh beſt:He muſt haue knowledge of eternal thinges,Almighty Ioue muſt harbour in his breaſt,With worldly cares he may not be oppreſt,The winges of wit and ſkil muſt heaue him hier.With great delight to ſatiſfye deſier.He muſt alſo be luſtye, free, and ſwiftTo trauail far to view the trades of men.Great knowledge often is gotten by the ſhift:Thinges that impart he muſt be quicke to pen,Reprouing vices ſharpely now and then.He muſt be ſwift when touched tyrauntes chafe,To gallop thence to keepe his carkas ſafe.If I had wel theſe qualities conſidered,Eſpecially that which I touched laſt,With ſpeedy flight my feete ſhould haue deliueredMy feeble bodye from a moſt boyſtrous blaſt,They ſhould haue caught me ere I had bene caſt,But too much truſt vnto a tyrauntes grace,I neuer ſhroake, nor chaunged port or place.I thought the Poets auncient libertiesFor pleas had bene allowed at the barre,I had forgot how new found tyranniesVVith truth and freedome were at open warre,That luſt was lawe, that might did make and mar,That among tyrauntes this is, and euer wasSic volo, ſic iubeo, ſtet pro ratione voluntas.VVhere luſt is lawe it booteth not to pleade,No Priuiledge nor liberties auayle.But with the learn'de whom Lawe, and Wiſedome leade,Although through raſhneſſe Poets ap to rayle,A plea of dotage may all Quarels quayle:Their olde licence their Writinges to expounde,Doth quit them clere from faults by Momus found.This freedome olde ought not to be debardFrom any wight that ſpeaketh ought, or writeth.The authors meaninge ſhould of right bee herd,Hee knoweth beſt to what ende hee enditeth:Woros ſometime beare more then the heart behiteth.Admit therefore the authors expoſicion,If playne for truth: if forſt, for his ſubmiſſion.In caſe of ſclaunder the lawes require no moreSaue to amende that ſeemed not well ſayde:Or to vnſay the ſlaunders ſayd afore,And aſke forgeueneſſe for the haſty brayde:To Heretickes no grater payne is laydeThen to recant their errours or retract:And worſe than theſe can bee no writers acte.Yes (quoth the Cat) thy raylinge wordes bee treaſon,And treaſon is farre worſe then Hereſy.Then muſt it follow by this auckwarde reaſon,That Kinges bee more than God in maieſty,And ſoules be leſſe then bodies in degree.For Heretikes both ſoules and God offend,Traytours but ſeeke to bring mans life to end.I ſpeake not this to abaſe the haynous fault,Of trayterous Acts abhorde by God, and man,But to make playne their iudgement to bee naughtThat Hereſie for leſſer ſinne do ban,I curſe them both as deepe as any can,And alway did: yet through my fooliſh rime,They ſtayned mee with that moſt hatefull crime.I neuer ment the Kinge, or counſayle harme,Vnleſſe to wiſhe them ſafety were offence,Agaynſt their power I neuer lifted Arme,Neyther Pen, nor Tongue for any ill Pretence.The Rime I made, though Rude, was ſound in Sence,For they therein whom I ſo fondly named,So ruled all that they were fowle defamed.This was no Treaſon but the very troth,They ruled all, none could deny the ſame:What was the cauſe then, why they were ſo wroth?What? is it treaſon in a riminge frameTo clip, to ſtretch, to adde, or chaunge a name?And this reſerued, there is no rime nor reaſon.That any craft can clout to ſeeme a treaſon.For where I ment the Kinge by name of Hog,I onely alluded to his Badge the Bore:To Louels name I added more our Dog,Becauſe moſt Dogs haue borne that name of yore:Theſe Metaphors I vſe with other more,As Cat, and Rat, the halfe names of the reſt,To hyde the Sence which they ſo wrongly wreſt.I maye you nowe what treaſon finde you heereEnough: you rubbed the guily on the Gaule,Both Sence, and names do note them very neere.I graunt that was the chiefe cauſe of my faule,Yet can you finde therein no treaſon at all:There is no worde agaynſt the Prince, or State,No harme to them whom all the Realme did hate.But ſith the guilty alwaies are ſuſpicious,And dread the ruine that muſt ſue by reaſon,They cannot choſe but count their counſayle viciousThat note their faults, and therefore call it treaſon:All grace, and goodneſſe with the lewde is geaſon.This is the cauſe why they good thinges do wreſtWhere as the good take ill thinges to the beſt.And therefore Baldwin boldly to the goodRebuke their fault, ſo ſhalt thou purchaſe thankesAs for the bad, thou ſhalt but moue their moode,Thoughe pleaſauntly thou touch their naughty prankes:Warne Poets all, no wiſe to paſſe the bankesOf Hellicon, but keepe within the

Vox populi, vox dei, in this caſe is not ſo Famous a prouere as true: The experience of al times do approue it.

# HOW RICHARD PLANtagenet Duke of Gloceſter, murdered his Brothers Children vſurpinge the Crowne, and in the.iij. yeare of his Raygne, was moſt worthely depriued of life, & Kingdome in Boſworth Playne, by Henry Earle of Richmond, after called Kinge Henry the ſeuenth, the.22. of Auguſt. 1485.
WHat heart ſo hard, but doth abhorre to heareThe rufull raygne of mee the third Richard?Kinge vnkindly cald though I y• Crown did weare.Who entred by rigour, but right did not regard,By tyranny proceedinge in killinge Kinge Edward,Fift of that name, right Heyre vnto the Crowne,With Richard his Brother, Princes of Renowne,Of truſt they were committed vnto my Gouernaunce,But truſt turned to treaſon to truly it was tried,Both agayuſt Nature, Duety, and Allegiaunce,For through my procurement moſt ſhamefully they dyedDeſire of a Kingdome forgetteth all Kinred,As after by diſcourſe it ſhalbe ſhewed here,Howe cruelly theſe Innocents in Priſon murdred were.The Lords, and Commons all with one aſſent,Protectour made mee both of Land, and Kinge,But I therewith alas was not content:For mindinge miſchiefe I ment another thinge,Which to confuſion in ſhort time did mee bringe,For I deſirous to Rule, and Raigne alone,Sought Crowne, and Kingdome, yet title had I none.To all Peeres, and Princes, a Preſident I may bee.The like to beware how they do enterpriſe,And learne their wretched falles by my Facte to foreſee,Which ruful ſtand bewaylinge my chaunce before their eyes,As one cleane bereft of all felicities:For right through might, I cruelly defaced,But might, helped right, and mee agayne diſplaced.Alas that euer Prince ſhould thus his honour ſtayneWith the bloud of Innocents moſt ſhamefull to bee toldeFor theeſe two Noble Imps I cauſed to bee ſlayne,Of yeares not full ripe as yet to rule, and raygne.For which I was abhorred both of yongue, and olde,But as the deede was Odious in Sight of God, and man,So ſhame, and Deſtruction in the ende I wan.Both God, Nature, Duty, Allegiaunce all forgot,This vile, and haynous Acte vnnaturally conſpired:Which Horrible deede done, alas, alas, God wotSutch Terrours mee tormented, and ſo my Sprites fired,As vnto ſurch a murder, and ſhamefull deede required,Sutch broyle dayly felt I, breedinge in my breſt,Whereby more, and more, increaſed myne vnreſt.My Brothers Children were right Heyres to the CrowneVVhom Nature rather bound to defend than deſtroy,But I not regardinge their Right, nor my RenowneMy whole care, and ſtudy to this ende did employ,The Crowne to obtayne, and them both to put downe:VVherein I God offended, prouokinge iuſt his ire,For this my attempt, and moſt wicked deſire.To curſed Cain compare my carefull caſe,VVhich did vniuſtly ſlay his Brother iuſt Abell,And did not I in rage make run that rufull raceMy Brother Duke of Clarence, whoſe death I ſhame to tellFor that ſo ſtraunge it was, as it was horrible?For ſure hee drenched was, and yet no Water neare,VVhych ſtraunge is to bee tolde to all that ſhall it heare.The But hee was not whereat I did ſhoote,But yet hee ſtoode betweene the Marke, and mee,For had hee liued, for mee it was no booteTo attempt the thinge that by no meanes could bee,For I third was then of my Brethren three:But yet I thought the Elder beinge gone,Then needes muſt I beare the ſtroke alone.Deſire of Rule made mee alas to rewe,My fatall fall I could it not foreſee,Puft vp in Pride, to Hauty then I grewe,That none my Peere I thought now could bee,Diſdayninge ſutch as were of high degree:Thus dayly ryſinge, and pullinge other downe,At laſt I ſhot how to win the Crowne.And dayly deuiſinge which was the beſt wayAnd meane how I might my Nephues both deuourI ſecretely then ſent without further delayTo Brackinbury then Lieutenaunt of the Tower,Requeſtinge him by letters to helpe vnto his power,For to accompliſhe this my deſyre, and will,And that hee would ſecretly my Brothers Children kill.Hee aunſwered playnely with a flat nay,Sayinge that to dye hee would not do that deede:But findinge then a proffer to my pray,Well worth a freende (quoth I) yet in time of neede.Iames Tyrrill hight his name, whom with all ſpeede,I ſent agayne to Brackinbury, as you heard before,Commaundinge him deliuer the Keyes of euery Dore.The Keyes hee rendered but Partaker would not beeOf that flagitious Fact. O happy man I ſay!As you haue heard before, hee rather choſe to dyeThen on thoſe ſeely Lambes his violent handes to lay.His Conſcience him pricked, his Prince to betray:O conſtant minde! that wouldeſt not condiſcendThee may I prayſe, and my ſelfe diſcommend.VVhat though heee refuſed, yet bee ſure you may,That other were as ready to take in hand that thinge,VVhich watched, and wayted as duly for their Pray,As euer did the Cat for the Mouſe takinge,And how they might their purpoſe beſt to paſſe bringe:VVhere Tyrrell hee thought good to haue no bloud ſhed,Becaſt them to kill by Smotheringe in their Bed.The Wolues at hande were ready to deuourThe ſeely Lambes in Bed whereas they layeAbidinge deat, and lookinge for the Hower,For well they wiſt, they could not ſcape away,Ah woe is mee, that did them thus betray,In aſſigninge this vile deede to bee done,By Myles Forreſt, and wicked Ihon Dighton.VVho priuely into their Chamber ſtale,In ſecret wiſe ſomewhat before Midnight,And gan the Bed together Tug, and hale,Be wrappinge them alas in wofull plight,Keepinge them downe, by force, by power, and might,With Halinge, Tugginge, Turmoylinge, Turnde, & Toſt,Till they of force were Forced yeelde the Ghoſt.VVhych when I heard, my hart I felt was eaſedOf grudge, of greefe, of inward deadly payne,But with this deede the Nobles were diſpleaſed,And ſayd: O God, ſhall ſuch a Tyraunt raygne,That hath ſo cruelly his Brothers Children ſlayne?Which Brute once blowen in the Peoples Eares,Their dolour was ſutch, that they braſt out in Teares.But what thinge may ſuffiſe vnto the greedy man,The more bee bathes in bloud, the bloudier hee is alway:By proofe I do this ſpeake, which beſt declare it can,Which onely was the cauſe of this Princes decaye.The Wolfe was neuer greedier than I was of my Pray,But who ſo vſeth murther full well affirme I dare,With murther ſhall be quit, ere hee thereof beware.And marke the ſequell of this begon miſchiefrWhich ſhortly after was cauſe of my decay,For high, and lowe conceyued ſutch a griefeAnd hate agaynſt mee, which ſought day by day,All wayes, and meanes that poſſiblye they may,On mee to bee reuenged for this ſinne,For cruell murderinge vnnaturally my kinne.Not onely kin, but Kinge the truth to ſayeVVhom vnkindly of Kingdome I bereft,His life from him I alſo raught awaye,With his Brathers, which to my charge was left.Of ambicion behold the worke, and weft,Prouokinge mee to do this haynous Treaſon,And murther them againſt all right and reaſon.After whoſe death thus wrought by violence,The Lords not ſykinge this vnnaturall deede,Began on mee to haue greate diffidence,Sutch brunninge hate gan in their hearts to breede,VVhich made me doubt, and ſore my daunger drede:VVhich doubt, and dreade proued not in vayne,By that enſued alas vnto my payne.For I ſuppoſinge all thinges were as I wiſhed,VVhen I had brought theſe ſeely Babes to bane,But yet in that my purpoſe far I miſſed:For as the Moone doth chaunge after the Wane,So chaunged the hearts of ſutch as I had taneTo bee moſt true, to Troubles did mee turne,Sutch rage, and rancour in boylinge Breaſts do burne.And ſodaynly a brute abroade was blowen,That Buckingham the Duke both ſterne, and ſtout,In field was ready, with diuers to mee knowen,To geue mee Battayle if I durſt come out:VVhich daunted mee, and put mee in great doubt,For that I had no Army then prepared,But after that I little for it cared.But yet remembringe, that oft a little ſparkeSuffered doth grow vnto a great flame,I thought it wiſedome wiſely for to warke,Muſtered then men in euery place I came.And marchinge forward dayly with the ſame,Directly towardes the Towne of Saliſbury,VVhere I gat knowledge of the Dukes Army.And as I paſſed ouer Saliſbury downe,The Rumour ran the Duke was fled, and gone,His Hoaſt diſperſed beſides Shreweſbury Towne,And hee diſmayed was left there poſt alone,Bewaylinge his chaunce, and makinge great mone:Towards whom I haſted withall expedition,Makinge due ſearch, and dilligent inquiſition.But at the firſt I could not of him heare,For hee was ſcaped by ſecret Bywayes,Vnto the Houſe of Humfrey Banaſtar,Whom hee had mutch preferred in his Dayes,And was good Lord to him in all aſſayes:Which hee full euill requited in the ende,When hee was driuen to ſeeke a truſty freende.For it ſo happened to his miſhap, alas,When I no knowledge of the Duke could heareA Proclamation by my Commaundement wasPubliſhed, and Cryed throughout euery Shyre,That who ſo could tell where the Duke were,A Thouſand marke ſhould haue for his payne.What thinge ſo hard but Money can obtayne?But were it for Money, Meede, or Dreede,That Banaſtar thus Betrayed his Gheſt,Diuers haue diuerſly deuined of this deede,Some deeme the worſt, and ſome Iudge the beſt,The doubt not diſſolued, nor playnely expreſt,But of the Dukes death hee doubtleſſe was cauſe,Which dyed without iudgement or order of Lawes.Loe! this Noble Duke I brought thus vnto bane,Whoſe doinges I doubted, and had in great dred,At Banaſtars houſe I made him to bee tane,And without iudgement bee ſhortned by the head,By the Shriffe of Shropſhire to Saliſbury led.In the Market place vpon the Scaffolde newe,Where all the Beholders did mutch his death rewe.And after this done I brake vp the hoaſte,Great y applauded with this heauy hap,And forthwith I ſent to euery Sea coaſteTo fore ſee all miſchieues, and ſtop euery gap,Before they ſhould chaunce, or light in my lap,Geuinge them in charge to haue good regarde,The Sea coaſt to keept with good watch and warde,Directinge my letters vnto euery Shriue,VVith ſtrait Commaundement vnder our name,To ſuffer no man in their partes to ariueNor to paſſe forth out of the ſame,As they tendered our fauour, and vodye would our blame,Doinge therein their payne, and induſtry,VVith diligent care, and vigilant Eye.And thus ſettinge thinges in order as you heare:To preuent miſchieues that might then betide,I thought my ſelfe ſure, and out of all feare,And for other thinges began to prouide:To Notingham Caſtle ſtrait did I ride,VVhere I was not very longe ſpace,Straunge tydinges came which did me fore amaze.Reported it was, and that for certaynty,Th' Earle of Richmonde landed was in WalesAt Milforde Hauen with an huge Army,Diſmiſſinge his Nauy which were many Sayles:VVhich at the firſt I thought flyinge Tales.But in the ende did otherwiſe proue,VVhich not a little did mee vexe, and moue.Thus fawninge Fortune gan on mee to frowne,And caſt on mee her ſcoruefull lowringe looke:Then gan I feare the fall of my Renowne,My heart it faynted, my Sinowes ſore they ſhooke,This heauy hap a ſcourge for ſinne I tooke,Yet did I not then vtterly diſpayre,Hopinge Storms paſt the whether ſhould bee fayre.And then with all ſpeede poſſible I might,I cauſed them muſter throughout euery Shyre,Determininge with the Earle ſpeedely to fight,Before that his power mutch encreaſed were,By ſutch as to him great fauour did beare:VVhich were no ſmal number by true report made,Dayly repayringe him for to ayde.Directinge my letters to diuers Noble men,VVith earneſt requeſt their power to prepare,To Notingham Caſtle whereas I lay then.To ayde and aſſiſt mee in this waighty affayre:VVhere ſtrayt to my preſence did then repayre,Thou Duke of Northfolke, his Eldeſt Sonne alſo,Wyth th' Earle of Northumberland, and many other mo.And thus beinge furniſht with men, and munition,Forward wee marched in order of Battayle ray,Makinge by Scouts euery way inquiſition,In what place the Earle with his Campe ſay:Towards whom directly wee tooke then our way,Euermore mindinge to ſeeke our moſt auayle,In place conuenient to geue to him Battayle.So longe wee laboured, at laſt our Armies metOn Boſworth playne beſides Leceſter towne,Where ſure I thought the Garland for to get,And purchaſe peace, or elſe to loſe my Crowne.But ſickle Fortune alas on me did frowne,For when I was Encamped in the Fielde,Where moſt I truſted, I ſooneſt was be guilde.The Brand of mallice thus kindlinge in my breſtOf deadly hate which I to him did beare,Pricked mee forwarde, and bad mee not deſiſt,But boldly fight, and take at all no feare,To win the field, and the Earle to conquere:Thus hopinge glory great to gayne, and get,Mine Army then in order did I ſet.Be tyde mee life or death I deſperately ran,And ioyned me in Battayle with this Earle ſo ſtoute,But Fortune ſo him ſauoured that hee the Battayle wanWith force and great power I was beſet about.Which when I did behold, in mids of the whole routeWith deut of Sword I caſt me on him to be reuenged,Where in the midſt of them my wretched life I ended.My body was hurried, and Tugged like a Dog,On horſebacke all naked, and bare as I was borne.My head, hands, and feete, downe hanginge like a Hog,Wyth Dirt, and bloud heſprent, my Corps all to torne,Curſnge the day that euer I was borne,With greeuous wounds bee mangled moſt horrible to ſee,So ſore they did abhorre this my vile cruelty.Loe!

WHen I had read this, wee had muche talke aboute it. For it was thought not vehement enough for ſo violent a man as king Rychard had bene. The matter was wel enough liked of ſome, but the meetre was miſliked almoſt of all.

And when diuers therfore woulde not allow it, what (quoth one) You know not whereupon you ſticke: els you would not ſo much miſlike this beecauſe of the vncertayne meetre. The cumelyneſſe called by the Rhetoricians Decorum, is ſpecially to be obſerued in al thinges. Seeing than that king Richard neuer kept meaſure in any of his doinges, ſeeing alſo he ſpeaketh in Hel, wheras is no order: it were againſt the Decorum of his perſonage to vſe eyther good meeter or order.

And therfore if his Oration were far worſe, in my opinion it were more fytt for him. Mars and the Muſes did neuer agree. Neither is to bee ſuffered that their myld ſacred Arte ſhould ſeeme to procede from ſo cruel and prophane a mouth as his: ſeinge they themſelues do abhorre it.

And although we reade of Nero, that hee was excellent both in Muſicke, & in verſifyinge, yet do not I remember that euer I ſaw any ſong or Verſe of his making: Minerau iuſtly prouiding that no monument ſhould remaine of any ſuch vniuſt vſurpaton. And therfore let this paſſe euen as it is which  the writer I knowe both could and would amend in many places, ſaue for keepinge the Decorū whych hee purpoſely hath oblerued heerein.

In deede (quoth I) as you ſay: It is not meete yt ſo diſorderly, and vnnaturall a man as Kynge Rychard was, ſhould obſerue any metrycall order in his talke: which notwithſtandinge in many places of his Oration is very wel kept: it ſhal paſſe therefore euen as it is, though to good for ſo euill a perſon. Then they willed me to reade ye blacke Smith, With a good will (quoth I) but firſt you muſt Imagin that you ſee him ſtandinge on a Ladder ouerſhrined wyth the Tybourne a meete Stage for all ſutch Rebels, & Traytours: & there ſtoutly ſaying as followeth.

# THE WILFVL FAL OF blacke Smith, and the fooliſhe ende of the Lord Awdeley in Iune. Anno. 1496. *⁎*
WHo is more bould than is the blinde Beard?Where is more craft than in the Clouted ſhoone?Who catch more harme than ſutch as nothinge feard?Where is more guile then where miſtruſt is none?No playſters helpe before the greefe bee knowen,So ſeemes by mee who could no wiſedome leare,Vntill ſutch time I bought my wit to deare.VVho beinge Boyſtrus, Stout, and braynleſſe bolde,Puft vp with Pride, with fierce, and Furies fret,Incenſt with Tales ſo rude and plainely tolde,VVherein deceit with double knot was knit,I trapped was as ſeely fiſhe in net,VVho ſwift in ſwimminge, not doubtfull of deſceit,Is caught in Ginne whererein is layde no bayt.Sutch force, and vertue hath this dolefull playnte,Set forth with Sighes, and teares of Crocodile,VVho ſeemes in ſight as ſimple as a Sainct,Hath layde a Baite the wareleſſe to beguile,And as they weepe they worke deſceit the whileVVhoſe rufull cheare the Rulers ſo relent,To worke in haſt that they at laſt repennt.Take heede therefore yee Rulers of the Lande,Bee blinde in ſight, and ſtop your other Eare,In ſentence ſlow, till ſkill the truth haue ſcande,In all your doomes both loue, and hare forbeare,So ſhall your iudgement Iuſt, and right appeare:It was a ſouthfaſt ſentence longe agoe,That haſty men ſhall neuer lacke mutch woe.Is it not truth? Baldwin, what ſayeſt thou?Say on thy minde, I pray thee muſe no more.Mee thincke thou ſtareſt and lokeſt I wot not howe,As though thou neuer ſaweſt a man before:By like thou muſeſt why I teach this lore,Elſe what I am that heere ſo boldly dare,Amonge the Preaſſe of Princes to compare.Though I bee bolde, I pray thee blame not mee,Like as men ſowe, ſutch Corne needes muſt the reape,And nature hath ſo planted in ech degree,That Crabs like Crabs will kindly crall, and creepe:The ſuttle Fore vnlike the ſeely ſheepe:It is accordinge to mine Education,Frowarde to Preaſſe in Rout, and Congregation.Behold my coate burnt with the Sparkes of Fyer,My Leather Aporn filde with horſe ſhooe Nayles,Behold my Hammer, and my Pincers heere,Beholde my lookes a marke that ſeldome fayles:My Cheekes declare I was not ed with Quayles,My Face, my Clothes, my Tooles with all my faſhion,Declare full well a Prince of rude Creation.A Prince I ſayd, a Prince I ſay againe,Though not by birth by crafrie vſurpacion,Who doubts but ſome men princehood do obtaine,By open force and wrongful dominacion,Yet while they rule are had in reputaion:Euen ſo by mee the while I wrought my feate,I was a prince at leaſt in my conceit.I dare the bolder take on me the name,Becauſe of him whom here I leade in hand,Tychet Lord Awdley a Lord of byrth and fame,Which with hys power and ſtrength ſerude in my hand,I was a Prince while that I was ſo mand:His butterflie ſtil vnderneath my ſhielde,Diſplayed was from Welles, to Blackheath fielde.But now behold he doth bewayle the ſame:Thus after wits their raſhneſſe do depraue,Behold diſmaid he dare not ſpeake for ſhame,He lookes like one that late came from the graue,Or one that came foorth of Trophonius caue,For that in wy the had ſo little pith,As hee a Lord to ſerue a traytout Smith.Such is the courage of the noble hart,Which doth deſpiſe the vile and baſer ſort,He may not touch that ſauours of the cart,Him liſteth not with ech Iacke out to ſport,He lets him paſſe for payring of his port,The iollye Egles carth not litle flees,The courtly ſilkes match ſeeld with homely frees.But ſurely Baldwin if I were allowdTo ſay the truth, I could ſomwhat declare:But clarkes wil ſay, this Smyth doth waxe to proud,Thus in precepts of wiſedome to compare,But Smithes muſt ſpeake that clarkes for feare ne dareIt is a thing that all men may lament,When clarkes keepe cloſe the truth leaſt they be ſhent.The Hoſtler, Barber, Myller, and the Smyth,Heare of the ſawes of ſuch as wiſedome ken,And learne ſome wit although they want the pith,The clarkes pretend and yet both now and then,The greateſt clarkes proue not the wiſeſt men:It is not right that men forbid ſhould bee:To ſpeake the truth al were he bond or free.And for becauſe I haue vſed to fret and fome,Not paſſing greatly whom I ſhould diſpleaſe,I dare be bold awhile to play the mome,Out of my ſacke ſome others faultes to leaſe,And let mine owne behinde my backe to peyſe,For' hee that hath his owne before his eye,Shal not ſo quicke anothers fault eſpieI ſay was neuer no ſuch woful caſe,As is when honour doth it ſelfe abuſe:The noble man that vertue doth embrace,Repreſſeth pride, and humbleneſſe doth vſe,By wiſdome workes, and raſhneſſe doth refuſeHis wanton wil and luſt that bridle can,In deede is gentle both to God and man.But where the nobles want both wit and grace,Regard no reede, care not but for their luſt,Oppreſſe the Poore, ſet will in reaſons place,And in their words, and domes bee founde vniuſt,Wealth goeth to wracke till all lye in the duſt:There Fortune frownes, and ſpite beginneth to growe,Till high, and lowe, and all bee ouerthrow.Then ſith that vertue hath ſo good reward,And after vice ſo duelye wayteth ſhame,How hapth that Princes haue no more regard,Their tender youth with vertue to enflame?For lacke whereof the wit and will is lame,Infect with folly, prone to luſt, and pride,Not knowinge howe them ſelues or theirs to guide.VVhereby it happeneth to the wanton wight,As to a Ship vpon the ſtormy Seas,VVhich lackinge ſterne to guide it ſelfe a right,From Shore, to Shore the Winde, and Tide do teeſe,Findinge no place to reſt and take his eaſe,Till at the laſt it ſinke vpon the Sande:So fare they all that haue not vertue cand.The Plowman firſt his Lande doth dreſſe, and tourne,And makes it apt or ere the Seede bee ſowe,VVhereby hee is full like to reape good Corne.VVhere otherwiſe no ſeede but weede would growe:By which enſample men may eaſely knowe,VVhen youth haue wealth before they can well vſe itIt is no wonder though they do abuſe it.How can hee rule well in a common wealth,VVhich knoweth not himſelfe in rule to frayne?How ſhould hee rule himſelfe in ghoſtly health,VVhich neuer learnde one leſſon for the ſame:If ſutch catch harme their Parentes are to blame:For needes muſt they bee blynde, and blindly led.Where no good leſſon can bee taught or read.Some thinke their youth diſcreet, and wiſely taught,That brag, and boaſt, and weare their Feather braue,Can royſt, and rout, both lowre, and looke a loft,Can ſwere, and ſtare, and call their felowes Knaue,Can pyll, and poll, and catch before they craue,Can Carde, and Dyce, both Cog, and Foyſt at fare,Play on vnthrifty, till their Purſe bee bare.Some teach their youth to pipe, to ſinge, and daunce,To Hauke, to Hunt, to chooſe and kill the game,To wynde their horne, and with their horſe to praunce,To play at Tenis, ſet the Lute in frame,Run at the Ringe and vſe ſutch other game:Which feates although they bee not all vnfit,Yet cannot they the marke of vertue hit.For noble youth, there is nothinge ſo meeteAs learninge is, to knowe the good from ill:To knowe the Tongues, and perfectly endyte,And of the lawes to haue a perfect ſkill,Things to reforme as right, and iuſtice will:For honour is ordeyned for no cauſe,But ſee right mayntayned by the Lawes,It ſpites my heart to heare when Noble menCannot dicloſe their ſecrets to their frend,In ſauegarde ſure with Paper, Inke, and Pen,But firſt they muſt a ſecretary finde,To whom they ſhow the bottome of their minde:And bee hee falſe, or true, a Blab, or cloſe,To him they muſt their counſayle needes diſcloſe.And where they rule that haue of Lawe no ſkill,There is no boote, they needes muſt ſeeke for ayde:Then ruled are they, and rule as others will:As hee that on a Stage his part hath playde:But hee was taught nought hath hee done, or ſayde.Sutch youth therefore ſeke Science of the Sage,As thinke to Rule when that yee come to age.Where youth is brought vp in feare, and Obedience,Kept from ill company, brydeled of their luſt,Do ſerue God duely, and know their allegiauuce,Learne godly wiſedome which time nor age can ruſt:There Prince, People, and Peeres needes proſper muſt,For happy are the People, and bleſſed is that Land,Where Truth, and Vertue haue got the ouer hand.I ſpeake this Baldwyn of this rufull Lorde,Whom I perforce do heere preſent to thee,Hee faynts ſo ſore hee may not ſpeake a worde,I pleade his cauſe without rewarde, or Fee,And am inforſt to ſpeake for him, and mee.If in his youth hee had beene wiſely tought,Hee ſhould not now his Wit ſo deere haue bought.For what is hee that hath but halfe a Wit,But may well know that Rebelles cannot ſpeede,Marke well my Tale, and take good heede to it,Recount it well and take it for good reede,If it proue vutrue I will not truſt my creede.Was neuer Rebell before the World, nor ſince,That could or ſhall preuayle againſt his Prince.For ere the Subiect beginneth to rebell,Within himſelfe let him conſider well,Foreſee the daunger, and beat well in his Brayne,How hard it is his purpoſe to obtayne,For if hee once bee entred to the Brears,Hee hath a raginge Wolfe faſt by the Ears.And when hee is once entred to rule the beaſtly rout,Although hee would hee can no way get out.Hee may bee ſure noue will to him reſorte,But ſutch as are the vile, and raſcall ſorte.All honeſt men as well the moſt as leſt,To taſt of treaſon will vtterly deteſt.Then let him way how longe hee can bee ſure,VVhere fayth, nor Frendſhip may no while endure:Hee whom hee truſteth moſt, to gayne a groateVVyll fall him from, and aſſay to cut his throate,Amonge the Knaues, and ſlaues where vice is rooted,There is no other Freendſhip to bee looked.With Slaſhers, Slaues,' & Snuffers ſo falſhoode is in priceThe ſimple fayth is deadly ſinne, and vertue counted vice.And where the Quarrell is ſo vile, and bad,That hope of ayde then is there to bee had?Thyncks hee that Men will run at this, or that,To do a thinge they knowe not hew, or what?Nor yet what daunger may thereof betide,VVhere Wyſedome woulde they ſhould at home abide,Rather then ſeeke, and knowe not what to finde.Wyſemen will firſt debate this in their minde:Full ſure they are if that they go to wrecke,Without all grace they looſe both head, and necke.They looſe their Lands, and Goods, their Childe, and WyfeWith Sorrow, and Shame ſhall leade a wofull Lyfe,If hee bee ſlayne in field hee dieth accurſt,Which of all wrecks wee ſhould attempt the worſt:And hee that dieth defendinge his liege Lord,Is bliſt, and bliſt againe by Gods owne Worde.And where the Souldiers wages is vnpayde,There is the Captayne ſlenderly obayde,And where the Souldier is out of feare, and dreede,Hee will bee lacke when that there is moſt neede,And priuately hee ſeekes his eaſe, and leaſure,And will bee ruled but at his will, and pleaſure.And where ſome drawe forth, and other do draw backe,There in the ende muſt needes hee woe, and wracke:To hope for ayde of Lordes it is but vayne,VVhoſe fore taught wit of treaſon knoweth the payne,They knowe what power a Prince hath in his Land,And what it is with Rebelles for to ſtand.They know by treaſon honour is defaced,Their ofſpring and their progenie diſgraced,They know to honour is not ſo worthy a thing,As to be true and faithful to their king,Aboue cogniſaunce or armes, or pedigrew far,An vnſpotted cote is like a blazing ſtar:Therfore the rebel is accurſt and mad,That hopeth for that which rebel neuer had:Who truſting ſtil to dales doth hang in hope,Til at the laſt he hang faſt by the rope,For though ſuch tales be told that hope might feede,Such fooliſh hope hath ſtil vnhappie ſpeede.It is a cuſtome that neuer wil be broken,In broyles the bag of lies is euer open,Such lying newes men daylye wil inuent,As can the hearers fancy beſt content,And as the newes do runne and neuer ceaſe,So more and more they dayly do encreaſe,And as they encreaſe they multiplie as faſt,That ten is ten hundred, ten thouſand at the laſt.And though the rebel had once got the elo,Thinkes he thereby to make his prince to yeild?A princes power within his owne region,Is not ſo ſoone brought vnto confuſion.For Kinges by God are ſtronge, and ſtoutly harted,That they of Subiects will not bee ſubuerted:If Kinges would yeld, yet God would them reſtrain,Of whom the Prince hath grace, and power to raygne:VVho ſtraytly chargeth vs aboue all thinge,That no man ſhould reſiſt agaynſt his Kinge.VVho that reſiſteth his dread Soueraygne Lorde,Doth dampne his ſoule by Gods owne very worde.A Chriſtian Subiect ſhould with honour due,Obey his Soueraygne though hee were a Iewe:VVhereby aſſured when Subiects do rebell,Gods wrath is kindled, and threatneth fyre, and hell.It is ſoone knowen when Gods wrath is kyndled,How they ſhall ſpeede with whom hee is offended:If God gaue victory to whom hee liketh beſt,Why looke they for it whom God doth moſt deteſt?For treaſon is hatefull, and abhord in Gods ſight,Example of Iudas that moſt wicked Wight:VVhich is the chiefe cauſe no treaſon preuayles,For ill muſt hee ſpeede, whom Gods wrath aſſayles:Let Traytors, and Rebels looke to ſpeede then,VVhen Gods mighty power is ſubiect to men.Mutch might bee ſayde that goeth more neere the Pith,But this ſuffiſeth for a rurall Smith.Baldwin when thou heareſt my reaſon in this caſe,Belike thou thinkeſt I was not very wyſe,And that I was accurſt, or elſe lacked grace,VVhich knowinge the ende of my fond Enterpriſe,VVould thus preſume agaynſt my Prince to ryſe:But as there is a cauſe that moueth euery woe,Somewhat there was whereof this ſore did growe.And to be plaine and ſimple in this caſe,The cauſe why I ſuch matter tooke in hand,Was nothing els but pryde and lacke of grace,Vayne hope of helpe, and tales both falſe and fond:By meanes whereof I did my prince withſtand,Denied the taxe aſſeſt by conuocationTo mainteine warre againſt the Scottiſh Nation.Whereat the Corniſh men did much repine,For they of Gold and Siluer were ful bare,And liued hardly digging in the Myne,They ſaid they had no money for to ſpare:Began firſt to grudge, and then to ſweare and ſtare,Forgot their due obeyſaunce, and raſhly fel to rauing,And ſaid they would not beare ſuc polling and ſuch ſhauing.They firſt accuſde the king as authour of their griefe,And then the byſhop Moreton. and ſir Reinold Bray,For they then were about the king moſt chiefe,Becauſe they thought the hole fault in them lay:They did proteſt to ryd them out of the way.Such thanke haue they that rule about a prince,They beare the blame of other mens offence.When I perceiued the commons in a rore,Then I and Flamocke conſulted both together,To whom the people reſorted more and more,Lamenting and crying, helpe vs now or neuer,Breake this yoake of bondage then are we free for euer:Whereat we enflamed in hope to haue a fame,To be their captaines tooke on vs the name.Then might you heare the people make a ſhout,And crye, God ſaue the Captaines, & ſende vs al good ſpeede,Then hee that fainted was counted but a lout,The ruffians ran abroade to ſowe ſedicious ſeede:To call for company then there was no needeFor euerye man laboured another to entice,To be partaker of his wicked vice.Then al ſuch newes as made for our auaile,Was brought to me, but ſuch as ſounded ill,Was none ſo bold to ſpeake or yet bewayle:Euerich was ſo wedded vnto his wyll,That foorth they cryed with bowes, ſword and byll.And what the ruffler ſpake, the lout toake for a verditeFor there the beſt was worſt, the worſt was beſt regarded.For when men goe a madding, there ſtil the vyler partConſpire together and wil haue al the ſwaye,And bee it wel or il, they muſt haue al the port,As they wil doe, the reſt muſt needes obay,They prattle and prate as doth the Popingaye:They crye and commaund the reſt to keepe tharray,Whiles they may raunge and rob for ſpoyle and pray.And when we had prepared euery thing,We went to Tawnton with al our prouiſion,And there we ſlue the Prouoſ of Pentyn,For that on the Subſedie hee ſate in commiſſion:He was not wiſe, nor yet of great diſcretion,That durſt approach his enemies in their rage,When wit nor reaſon could their yre aſſwage.From thence we went to Welles, where wee were receiuedOf this Lord Awdley, as of our chiefe captaine,And ſo had the name, but yet he was deceiued,For I in deede did rule the clubbiſh trayne,My cartly knightes true honour did diſdayne:For like doth laue his like. it wil be none other,A chorle wil loue a chorle, before he wil his brother.From Wels to Wincheſter, and ſo to Blackheat field,And there we encamped looking for more ayde,But when none came, we though our ſelues beguilde,Such Corniſh men as knew they were betraide,From their felowes by night away they ſtraide:There might we learne how vayne it is to truſt,Our fayned frendes in quarels ſo vniuſt.But we the ſturdy captains yt thought our power was ſtrōg,Were bent to trye our Fortune what euer ſhould beideWe were the bolder, for that the king ſo longDeferred battaile: which ſo increaſt our pryde,That ſure we thought the king himſelfe did bydeWithin the cittie, therfore with courage hault,We did determine the cittye to aſſault.But he working contrary to our expectation,Was fullye mynded to let vs runne our race,Til wee were from our domeſtical habitation,VVhere that of ayde or ſuccour was no place,And then to be plagued as it ſhould pleaſe his grace,But al doubtful plaintes▪ how euer they did ſound,To our beſt vayle we aſway did expound.VVhen that the king ſaw tyme, with courage boldeHe ſent a power to circunent vs al:VVhere wee encloaſed as ſimple ſheepe in fold,VVhere ſlayne & myrdred as beaſts in butchers ſtall,The king himſelfe, what euer thaunce might fall,VVas ſtrōgly encāped within S. Georges ſield,And there abode til that he hard vs yelde.Then downe we kneled, and cryed to ſaue our lyfe,It was to late our folly to bewayle,There were we ſpoyled of armour, cote, and knife:And we which thought with pride the city to aſſayle,VVere led in priſoners naked as my nayle,But of vs two thouſand they had ſlaine before,And wee of them three hundred and no more.This my Lord and wee the captaines of the weſtTooke our Iane at Newgate faſt in ferters tyde,Where after triall we had but little reſt,My Lord throw London was drawne on a ſlyde,To Tower hil where with an axe he dyed,Clad in his cote armour painted al in paper,Corne and reuerſed inſpight of his behauer.And I with Thomas Flamocke, & other of our bent,As traytours at Tybourne our iudgement did obay:The people looked I ſhould my fault lament,To whom I holdly ſpake that for my fond aſſay,I was ſure of fame that neuer ſhould decay:VVhereby ye may perceiue bayn glory doth enflameAſwel the meaner ſort as men of greater name.But as the ſickely patient, ſometime hath deſireTo caſt the things that Phiſicke hath denyed,And hath both payne and ſorow for his hyre,The ſame to me right wel may be applied,Which while I raught for fame on ſhame did ſlydeAnd ſekinge fame brought foorth my bitter bane.As he that fyered temple of Diane.I tel thee Baldwin, I muſe right oft to ſeeHow euery man for wealth and honour gapeth,How euery man would climbe aboue the ſkie,How euery, man chaſſured meane ſo hateth,How froward Fortune oft their purpoſe mateth:And if they hap their purpoſe to obtaint,Their wealth is woe, their honour care and paine.Wee ſee the ſeruaunt more happie then his Lord,Wee ſee him liue when that his Lord is dead,He ſleepeth ſound, is mery at his boorde,No ſorow in his hart doth vexe his head:Happie then is he that pouertie can wed,What gaine the mightye conquerours when they be deadBy all the ſpoile and bloud that they haue ſhed?The terrible tower where honour hath his ſeate,Is hye on rockes more ſlipper then the yſe,Where ſtil the whorling wynde doth roare and beate,Where ſodaine qualmes and peries ſtil aryſe,And is beſet with many ſundry vice,So ſtraunge to men when firſt they come thereat,They be amaſed, and do they wot not what.He that preuailes and to the tower can clime,With trouble and care muſt needes abridge his dayes,And he that ſlydes may curſe the hower and tyme,He did attempt to geeue ſo fond aſſaies,And al his life to ſorow and ſhame obayes▪Thus ſlide he downe or to the top aſcend,Aſſure himſelfe repentaunce is the end.Wherfore Baldwine do thou record my nameTo bee enſample to ſuch as credite lies,Or thirſt to ſucke the ſugred cup of fame,Or do attempt againſt their prince to ryſe,And charge them al to keepe within their ſiſe:Who doth aſſay to wreſt beyond his ſtrength,Let him be ſure he ſhal repent at length,And at my requeſt admoniſh thou al men,To ſpend wel the talent which God to them hath lent,And he that hath but one, let him not toyle for ten,For one is too much, vnleſſe it bee wel ſpent:I haue had the proofe, therfore I now repent,And happie are thoſe men, and bliſt and bliſt is hee,As can be wel content to ſerue in his degree.FINIS.Maiſter Cauille.
IT is pity (quoth one) that the metre is no better ſeeing ye matter is ſo good: you may do very wel to helpe it, and a little fyling would make it formal.

The authour himſelfe (quoth I) coulde haue done that, but he would not, and hath deſyred me that it maye paſſe in ſuche rude, ſort as you haue hearde it: for hee obſerueth therein a double decorum both of the Smith, and of himſelfe: for he thinketh it not meete for the Smyth to ſpeake nor for himſelfe to wryte in any exacte kinde of meeter Welſayd another: the matter is notable to teache al people aſwel officers as ſubiects to cōſyder their eſtates and to lyue in loue & obedience to the higheſt powers. what ſo euer they bee, whom God eyther by byrth, law, ſucceſſion, or vniuerſal election, doth or ſhall aucthoriſe in his owne rowme to execute his lawes and iuſtice, among any people or nation: for by all theſe meanes God placeth his deputies, and in my iudgemēt there is no meane ſo good either for the cōmon quiet of the people, or for gods free choiſe, as the natural order of enheritaunce by lyneal diſcent for ſo it is left in Gods hands, to create in the wombe what prince hee thinketh meeteſt for his purpoſes: the people alſo know their princes and therfore the more gladly and willinglie receiue and dy them. And although ſame realmes more careful then wye, haue enayled their Crowne to their Male thinking it not meete for the fyminine ſexe to beare the royal office: yet if they conſyder all  circumſtaunces, and the chiefeſt vſes of a prince in a realme, they ſhal ſee howe they are deceiued. For princes are Gods lieutenauntes or deputies, to ſee gods lawes executed among their ſubiects, not to rule accordinge to their owne luſtes or deuiſes, but by the preſcript of Gods lawes: ſo that the chiefeſt point of a princes office cōſiſteth in obediēce to god and to his ordinaunces, & what ſhould let but that a woman may be as obediente vnto God as a mā? The ſecond point of a princes office is to prouide for the impotent, nedy, and helpeleſſe, as widowes, orphanes, lame, and decrepite perſons: & ſeeing women are by nature tender harted, milde, and pitiful who may better than they diſcharge this dutie? Yea but a woman lacketh courage, boldneſſe, and ſtomacke, to withſtand the aduerſarie, and ſo are her ſubiects an open ſpoile to their enemies. Debora, Iael, Iudith. Thomiris, and other do proue the contrarie. But graunt it were ſo: what harme were that ſeeing victorie conſiſteth not in wyt or fore, but in Gods pleaſure. I am ſure that whatſoeuer prince doth his dutie in obaying God, and cauſing Iuſtice to be miniſtred according to Gods lawes, ſhal not onely lacke warre (be he man, woman or child) but alſo be a terrour to al other princes. And if God ſuffer any at any time to be aſſayled it is for ye deſtruction of the aſſayler, whether he be  forreine foe, & to the honour & profite of ye vertuous prince, in whoſe behalfe rather then he ſhal miſcarye, God himſelfe wil fight with enferuous, & earthquakes  from the land and waters, and with ſtormes, and lighteninges from the ayre and ſkies. Moe warres haue bene ſought throughe the wilfull & hauty courages of kinges and greater deſtructions hapned to realme thereby, than by any other meanes. And as for wiſedome and pollicye, ſeeing it conſiſteth in folowing the counſel of many godly, learned, & long experienced heades, it were better to haue a Woman, who conſideringe her owne weakenes and inabilitie, ſhould be ruled thereby, than a man which preſuming vpon his owne fond brayne, will heare no aduiſe ſaue his owne. You muſe peraduenture wherfore I ſay this. The franticke heades whiche diſable our Queene, becauſe ſhe is a woman, & our king becauſe he is a ſtraunger, to be our prynces & chief gouernours hath cauſed me to ſay thus much For what ſoeuer man, woman, or childe, is by the conſent, of the whole realme eſtabliſhed in the royal ſeate, ſo it haue not bene iniuriouſlye procured by rigour of ſword and open force, but quietly, by title, eyther of enheritaunce, ſucceſſion, lawful bequeſte, common conſent, or election, is vndoubtedlye choſē by God to be his deputie: and whoſoeuer reſiſtethe any ſuch, reſiſteth againſt God himſelfe, and is a ranke traytour and rebel, and ſhalbe ſure to proſper aſwel as the Blacke Smyth and other ſuche haue done. Al reſiſt that wilful breake any lawe, not being againſt Gods law, made by common conſet for  the wealth of the realme, and commaunded to bee kept by authoritye of the prince: or that deny to pay ſuch duties, as by conſent of the high court of Parliament, are appointe to the Prince for the defence and preſeruation of the realme. You haue ſayd very truly herein (quoth I) and I truſt this terrible example of the Blacke Smyth, will put all men in mynde of their duties and teach them to be obediēt to al good lawes, and lawful contributions. The ſcriptures do forbid vs to rebel, or forciblie to withſtand Princes, though they commaūd vniuſt thinges: yet in any caſe we may not do thē but receiue quietly at the princes hand whatſoeuer puniſhment God ſhal ſuffer to be layd vpon vs for oure refuſal, God wil ſuffer none of his to be tēpted aboue their ſtrength. But becauſe theſe two perſons laſt before rehearſed were thought not onelye obſcure in matter, but alſo crabbed in the meeter (I haue here readye to ſupplie that which lacked in theym) Shores wife, an eloquent wench, which ſhal fyniſh out both in metre & matter, that which coulde not comlily be ſayd in their perſons Marke I pray you what ſhee ſayth, & tel me how you lyke it.

# HOVVE SHORES WIFE Kinge Edwarde the fowerthes Concubine, was by king Richard deſpoyled of al her goodes, and forced to doe open pennaunce.
AMong the reſt by Fortune ouerthrowen,I am not leaſt, that moſt may wayle her fate:My fame and bruite abrode the world is blowen,Who can forget a thing thus done ſo late?My greae miſchaunce, my fal and heauy ſtate,Is ſuch a marke whereat ech tongue doth ſhoote,That my good name is pluckt vp by the rohte.This wandring world bewitched me with wyles,And won my wits with wanton ſugred ioyes,In Fortunes frekes who truſtes her when ſhe ſmiles,Shal fynde her falſe and ful of ickle toyes,Her triumphes al but fil our eares with noyes,Her flattering giftes are pleaſure mixt with payne.Yea al her wordes are thunders threatning raine.The fond deſire that we in glorye ſet,Doth thirle our hartes to hope in ſupper hap,A blaſt of pompe is al the fruite we get,And vnder that li hid a ſoden clap,An ſeeking reſt vnwares wee fall in trap:In groping flowers: with nettles ſtong we are,In labouring long we reape the crop of care,Oh darke deceit with painted face for ſhowe,Oh poyſoned bayte that makes vs eager ſtil,Oh fayned frend deceiuing people ſo,Oh world of the wee cannot ſpeake to ill:Yet fooles we are to bend ſo to thy ſkyl,The plague and ſcourge, that thouſands dayly feele,Should warne the wiſe to ſhun thy whirling whele.But who can ſtop the ſtreame that runnes ful ſwift?Or quench the fire that crept is in the ſtrawe?The thirſtie drinkes, there is no other ſhift,Perforce is ſuch that nede obayes no lawe:Thus bound we are in worldly yokes to drawe,And cannot ſtay, nor turne againe in time,Nor learne of thoſe that ſought to high to clime.My ſelfe for profe ſo here I now appeare,In womans weede with weeping watred eyes,That bought her youth and her delightes full deare,Whoſe loud reproach doth ſound vnto the ſkiesAnd bids my corps out of the graue ariſe,As oe that may no longer hyde her face,But needes muſt come and ſhew her piteous caſe.The ſheete of ſhame wherein I ſhrowded wasDid moue me oft to plame before this day,And in myne eares did ryng the trumpe of braſſe,Which is defame, that dothech vice bewraye.Yea though ful dead and low in earth I lay,I heard the voyce of me what people ſaid,But then to ſpeake alas I was afrayde.And now a time for mee I ſee preparde,I heare the liues and falles of many wightes:My tale therfore the ter may be heard,For at the torch the little candle lightes.Where pageauntes ue, ſmal thinges fil out the ſights,Wherfore geeue eare, good Baldwin do thy beſt,My tragedye to place among the reſt.Becauſe the truth ſhal witneſſe wel with thee,I wil rehearſe in order as it fell,My life, my death, my doleful deſtenie,My wealth, my woe, my doing euery deale,My bitter bliſſe, wherein I long did dwel:A whole diſcourſe by me Shores wife by name,Now ſhalt thou heare as thou hadſt ſeene the ſame.Of noble bloud I cannot boaſt my birth,For I was made out of the meaneſt molde,Mine heritage but ſeuen foote of earth,Fortune ne gaue to me the giftes of Gold:But I could brag of nature if I would,Who filde my face with fauour freſh and fayre,Whoſe beauty ſhone like Phoebus in the ayre.My ſhpe ſome ſayd was ſeemely to ech ſight,My countenaunce did ſhow a ſober grace,Myne eyes in lookes were neuer proued light,My tongue in wordes was chaſt in euery caſe,Myne eares were deafe and would no louers place,Saue that (alas) a prince did blot my brow.Loe, there the ſtrong did make the weake to bow.The maieſtie that kinges to people beare,The ſtately port, the awful cheare they ſhow,Doth make the meane to ſhrinke & couch for feaLike as the hound, that doth his maiſter knowe:What then, ſince I was made vnto the bow:There is no cloake, can ſerue to hyde my fault,For I agreed the fort he ſhould aſſault.The Eagles forte ſubdues ech bird that flies.What mettal may reſiſt the flaming fire?Doth not the Sunne, daſtll the cleareſt eyes,And melt the yſe, and make the froſt retire?Who can withſtand a puiſſaunt kinges deſire?The ſtiffeſt ſtones are perced through with tooles,The wiſeſt are, with princes made but fooles.If kinde had wrought my forme in common frames,And ſet me forth in colours blacke and browne,Or beautye had beene parchd in Phoebus flames,Of ſhame faſt wayes had pluct my fethers downe,Then had I kept my fame and good renowne:For natures giftes was cauſe of al my griefe.A pleaſaunt pray entiſeth many a thiefe.Thus wo to thee that wrought my peacockes pride,By cloathing me with natures tapiſtrie,Wo worth the hue wherein my face was dyde,Which made me thinke I pleaſed euery eye:Like as the ſterres make men behold the ſkie,So beauties ſhow doth make the wiſe ful fond.And bringes free hartes ful of to endieſſe bond.But cleare from blame my frendes cannot be foundBefore my time my youth they did abuſe:In mariage, a prentiſe was I bound,Then that meere loue I knew not how to vſe.But wel away. that cannot me excuſe,The harme is mine though they deuiſed my care,And I muſt ſmart and ſit in ſlaunderous ſnare.Yet geue me leaue to pleade my cauſe at large,If that the horſe de runne beyond his race,Or any thing that keepers haue in charge,Do breake their courſe, where rulers may take place:Or meate be ſet before the hungries face,Who is in fault thoffender yes or no,Or they that are the cauſe of al this woe?Note wel what ſtrife this forced mariage makes,What loathed liues do come where loue doth lacke.What ſcratching breers do grow vpon ſuch brakes,What common weales by it are brought to wracke,What beauye loade is put on pacientes backe,What ſtraunge delightes this brunch of vice doth breedeAnd marke what graine ſpringes out of ſuch a ſeede.Compel the hanke to ſit that is vnmand,Or make the hound vntaught to drawe the Deere,Or bring the free againſt his wil in hand,Or moue the ſad a pleaſaunt tale to heare,Your time is loſt and you are neuer the neere:So loue ne learnes of force the knot to knit,She ſerues but thoſe that feele ſweete fancies fit.The leſſe defame redoundes to my diſpraiſe,I was entiſte by traynes, and trapt by truſt:Though in my power remained yeas and nayes,Vnto my frendes yet needes conſent I muſt,In euery thing, ye lawful or vniuſt.They brake the bowes and ſhakt the tree by ſleight,And bent the wand y• mought haue grown ful ſtreite.VVhat helpe is this, the pale thus broken downe,The deere muſt needes in daunger runne aſtray:At me therfore why ſhould the world ſo frowne,My weakeneſſe made my youth a Princes pray.Though wiſedome ſhould the courſe of nature ſtay,Yet trye my caſe who liſt, and they ſhall proue,The rypeſt wits are ſooneſt thralles to loue.VVhat nede I more to cleare my ſelfe to much?A King me wan, and had me at his call:His royal ſtate his Princely grace was ſuch,The hope of will (that women ſeeke for all,)The eaſe, the wealth, the gyfts which were not ſmal,Beſieged me ſo ſtronglye round about,My power was weake I could not hold him out.Duke Hannibal in al his conqueſt great,Or Caeſar yet, whoſe triumphes did excede,Of al their ſpoyles which made them toyle and ſweate,VVere not ſo glad to haue ſo rich a meede,As was this Prince when I to him agreed.And yelded me a priſoner willinglye,As one that knew no way away to flye.The Nightingale for al his merye voyceNor yet the Larke that yet delightes to ſing,Did neuer make the hearers ſo reioyce,As I with wordes haue made this worthy king:I neuer iarde, in tune was euery ſtring,I cmpered ſo my tongue to pleaſe his eare,That what I ſaid was currant euery where.I ioynde my talke, my ieſtures, and my graceIn wictie frames that long might laſt and ſtand,So that I brought the King in ſuch a caſe,That to his death I was his chiefeſt hand,I gouerned him that ruled al this land:I bare the ſword though he did weare the crowne,I ſtrake the ſtroke that threw the mightie downe:If Iuſtice ſaid that iudgement was but death,VVith my ſweete woordes I could the king perſwade,And make him pauſe and take therein a breath,Til I with ſuite the fautors peace had made:I knew what waye to vſe him in his trade,I had the arte to make the Lyon meeke.There was no point wherein I was to ſeeke.If I did frowne, who then did looke awrie:If I did ſmyle, who would not laugh outright?If I but ſpake, who durſt my wordes denie?If I purſued, who would forſake the flight?I meant my power was knowen to euery wight,On ſuch a height good hap had built my bower,As though my ſweete ſhould neuer haue turnd to ſower.My huſband then as one that knew his good,Refuſde to kepe a Princes Concubine,Foreſeing the end and miſchief as it ſtoode,Againſt the King did neuer much repine,He ſaw the grape whereof he dranke the wine,Though inward thought his hart did ſtil torment.Yet outwardlye he ſeemde he was content.To purchaſe praiſe and win the peoples zeale,Yea rather bent of kinde to do ſome good,I euer did vphold the common weale,I had delight to ſaue the guiltleſſe bloud:Ech ſuters cauſe when that I vnderſtood,I did prefer as it had beene mine owne,And helpe them vp that might haue bene orethrowne.My power was preſt to right the pooremans wrong,My handes were free to geeue where nede required,To watch for grace I neuer thought it long,To doe men good I nede not be deſired.Nor yet with giftes my hart was neuer hyred.But when the Ball was at my foote to guide,I plaied to thoſe that Fortune did abide.My want was wealth, my woe was eaſe at wil,My robes was rih and brar than the Sunne:My Fortune thou was far about my ſkil,My ſtate was great, my glaſſe did euer runne,My fatal reede ſo happely was ſponne,That then I ſate in earthly pleaſurs clad,And for the time a goodeſſe place I had.But I had not ſo ſone this life poſſeſt,But my good hap began to ſlip aſyde.And Fortune then did me ſo ſore moleſt,That vnto plaintes was turned al my Pride,It booted not to rowe againſt the tide:Myne dares were weake my hart and ſtrength did fayle,The winde was rough I durſt not beare a ſayle,VVhat ſteps of ſtrife belong to high eſtate?The climing vp is doubtful to endure,The ſeate it ſelfe doth purchaſe priuie hate,And honours fame is ekle and vnſure,And al ſhe bringes, is flowers that be vnpure:VVhich fal as faſt as they do ſprout and ſpring,Ind cannot laſt they are ſo vayne a thing.VVe count no care to catch that we do wiſh,But what we win is long to vs vnknowne,Tyl preſent payne be ſerued in our diſh,VVe ſcarce perceiue whereon our griefe hath growen:VVhat graine proues wel that is ſo raſhly ſowen?If that a meane did meaſure all out deedes,Ind ſteede of corne we ſhould not gather weedes.The ſetled mynde is free from Fortunes power,They neede not feare who looke not vp aloft,But they that clyme are careful euery hower,For when they fal they light not very ſoft:Examples hath the wiſeſt warned oft,That where the trees the ſmalleſt braunches bere,The ſtormes do blow and haue moſt rigour there.VVhere is it ſtronge but neere the Ground, and Roote?VVhere is it weake but on the higheſt Sprayes?VVhere may a man ſo ſurely ſet his Foote,But on thoſe Boowes that groweth lowe alwayes?The little Twiges are but vnſtedfaſt ſtayes,If they breake not, they bend with euery blaſt,VVho truſts to them ſhall neuer ſtand full faſt.The Winde is great vppon the higheſt Hilles,The quiet lyfe is in the Dale bee lowe,VVho treades on Iſe ſhall ſlide againſt their wills,They want not Cares that curious Artes would know.VVho liues at eaſe, and can content him ſo,Is perfect wiſe, and ſets vs all to Schoole,VVho hates this lore may well be calde a Foole.VVhat greater griefe may come to any life,Than after ſweete to taſte the bitter ſower?Or after Peace to fall at Warre, and ſtrife,Or after myrth to haue a cauſe to lower?Vnder ſutch Props falſe Fortune builds her Bower,On ſodayne chaunge her fliteringe Frames bee ſet,VVhere is no way for to eſcape her Net.The haſty ſmart that Fortune ſendes in ſpiteIs hard to brooke where gladneſſe wee embrace,Shee threatens not, but ſodainly doth ſmite,VVhere Ioy is moſt, there doth ſhee Sorrow place.But ſure I thincke, this is to ſtraunge a caſe,For vs to feele ſutch greefe amid our Game,And know not why vntill wee taſte the ſame.As earſt I ſayd, my bliſſe was turnd to bale,I had good cauſe to weepe and wringe my hands,And ſhewe ſad cheere with Countenaunce full pale,For I was brought in ſorrows wofull bands:A Pirry came and ſet my Ship on Sandes,VVhat ſhould I hide, or colour Care, and Noye?Kinge Edward dyed in whom was all my Ioye.And when the Earth receiued had his Corſe,And that in Tumbe, thys worthy Prince was layde,The World on mee began to ſhewe his Force,Of Troubles then my part I longe aſſayed:For they of whom I neuer was afrayde,Vndid mee moſt, and wrought mee ſutch diſpite,That they bereft mee from my pleaſure quite.As longe as life remainde in Edward breſt,VVho was but I? who had ſutch frends at call?His body was no ſooner put in Cheſt,But well was hee that could procure my fall:His Brother was mine Enemy moſt of allProtectour then, whoſe vice did ſtill abound,From ill to worſe till death did him confound.Hee falſely fayned, that I of counſayle wasTo poyſon him which thinge I neuer ment,But hee could ſet thereon a face of braſſe,To bringe to paſſe his lewde, and falſe entent,To ſntch miſchiefe this Tyrants heart was bent:To God ne man hee neuer ſtoode in awe,For in his wrath hee made his will a lawe.Lord Haſtings bloud for vengeaunce on him cryes,And many moe, that were to longe to name:But moſt of all and in moſt wofull wyſeI had good cauſe this wretched man to blame,Before the World I ſffered open ſhame,VVhere people were as thicke as is the Sande,I Penaunce tooke with Taper in my Hand.Ech Eye did ſtare, and looke mee in the Face,As I paſt by the Rumours on mee ran,But Patience then had lent mee ſutch a Grace,My quiet Lookes were prayſed of euery man:The Shamefaſte bloud brought mee ſutch coulour thenThat Thouſands ſayd, which ſawe my Sober cheere,It is great ruth to ſee this Woman heere.But what preuaylde the peoples pitty there?This raginge Wolfe would ſpare no guiltleſſe bloud.Oh wicked Wombe that ſutch ill fruict did beare,Oh curſed Earth that yeldeth forth ſutch Mud,The Hell conſume all thiuges that did thee good,The Heauens ſhut their Gates againſt thy Sprite,The World tread downe thy Glory vnder Feete.I aſke of God a vengeaunce on thy Bones,Thy ſtinkinge Corps corrups the Ayre I know:Thy ſhamefull death no earthly Wight bemoanes,For in thy Lyfe thy workes were hated ſo,That euery man did wiſhe thy ouerthrowe:VVherefore I may, though parciall now I am,Curſe euery cauſe whereof thy body came.VVo worth the man that fathered ſutch a childe:VVo worth the Hower wherein thou waſt begate,VVo worth the Breſts that haue the world begilde,To nouriſh thee that all the World did hate,VVo worth the Gods that gaue thee ſutch a face,To liue ſo longe, that death deſerude ſo ofte.VVo worth the chaunce that ſet thee vp a loft.Yee Princes all, and Rulers euerychone,In puniſhment beware of hatreds ire.Before yee ſcourge, take heede, looke well thereon:In wrothes ill will if malice kindle fire,Your heartes will burne in ſutch a bote deſire,That in thoſe flames the Smoake ſhall dimme your ſight,Yee ſhall forget to ioyne your Iuſtice right.You ſhould not iudge till thinges bee well diſcernde,Your charge is ſtill to maintayne vpright lawes,In conſcience rules yee ſhould bee throughly learnde,VVhere clemency bids wrath, and raſhneſſe pauſe,And further ſayth: Strike not without a cauſe,And when yee ſmite do it for Iuſtice ſake,Then in good part ech man your Scourge will take.If that ſutch zeale had moued this Tyrauntes minde,To make my plague a warrant for the reſt,I had ſmall cauſe ſutch fault in him to finde,Sutch puniſhment is vſed for the beſt:But by ill will. and power I was oppreſt.Hee ſpoyled my goods, and left mee bare, and Poore,And cauſed mee to begge from Doore, to Doore.VVhat fall was this, o come from Princes Fare,To watch for crummes amonge the blinde, and lame?VVhen almes were delt I had an hungry ſhare,Becauſe I knewe not how to aſke for ſhame,Till force & neede had brought me in ſutch frame,That ſtarue I muſt, or learne to beg an Almes,VVith booke in hande to ſay S. Dauids Pſalmes.VVhere I was wont the golden Chaynes to weare,A paire of Beades about my Necke was wound,A lynnen cloth was lapt about my heare,A ragged Gount that trayled on the Ground,A Diſh that clapt, and gaue a heauy ſound,A ſtayinge ſtaffe, and wallet therewithall,I beare about as witneſſe of my fall.I had no houſe wherein to hide my head,The open Streate my lodginge was perforce,Full oft I went all hungry to my Bed,My fleſhe conſumde, I looked like a corſe,Yet in that plight who had on mee remorſe?O God thou knoweſt my freendes forſooke mee than,Not one holpe mee who ſuckred many a man.They frownde on mee, that fawnd on mee before,And fled from mee that fellowed mee full faſt,They hated mee, by whom I ſet much ſtore,They knew full well my fortune did not laſt,In euery place I was condemnd and caſt:To plead my cauſe at Bait was no boote,For euery man did treade me vnderfoote.Thus longe I liude all weary of myfe,Till death appch, and  mee from that woeExample take by mee both Mayde, and Wyfe,Beware, takeheede, fall not to folly ſo,A Mirrour make by my great ouerthrowe:Dee this World, and all his wanton wayes,Beware by mee that ſpent ſo ill her dayes.FINIS.Th.
