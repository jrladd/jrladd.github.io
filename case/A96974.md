# To the Ingenuous READER.
SIR.
THeſe leaves preſent you with ſome ſow drops of that Ocean of Wit, which flowed from thoſe two breſts of this Nation, the two Univerſities; and doth now (the ſluces being puld up) overflow the whole Lands: or rather like thoſe Springs of Paradice, doth water and enrich the whole worlds whilſt the Fountains themſelvss are dryed up, and that Twin-Paradiſe become deſart. For then were theſe Verſes Compoſed, when Oxford and Camebridge were Ʋniverſities, and a Colledge  more learned then a Town-Hall; when the Buttery and Kitchin could ſpeak Latine, though not Preach; and the very irrational Turnſpits had ſo much knowing modeſty, as not to dare to come into a Chappel, or to mountany Pulpits but their own. Then were theſe Poems writ, when peace and plenty were the beſt Patriots and Maecenaſſes to great Wits; when we could ſit and make Verſes under our own Figtrees, and be inſpired from the juice of our own Vines: then, when it was held no ſin for the ſame man to be both a Poet, and a Prophet; and to draw predictions no leſſe from his Verſe, then his Text. Thus you ſhall meet here St. Pauls Rapture in a Poem, and the fancy as high and as clear as the third Heaven, into which  that Apoſtle was caught up: and this not onely in the raviſhing expreſſions and extaſies of amorous Compoſures and Love Songs; but in the more grave Dorick ſtrains of ſollid Divinity: Anthems that might have become Davids Harpe, and Aſaphs Quire, to be ſung, as they were made, with the Spirit of that chief Muſitian. Againe, In this ſmall Glaſſe you may behold your owne face, fit your own humors, however wound up and tuned; whether to the ſad note, and melancholy look of a diſconſolate Elegy, or thoſe more ſprightly jovial Aires of an Epithalamium, or Epinichion. Further, would you ſee a Miſtreſſe of any age, or face, in her created, or uncreated complexion: this mirrour preſents you with more ſhapes then a Conjurers  Glaſſe, or a Limnors Pencil. It will alſo teach you how to court that Miſtreſſe, when her very waſhings and pargettings cannot flatter her; how to raiſe a beauty out of wrinkles fourſcore years old, and to fall in love even with deformity and uglineſſe. From your Miſtreſſe it brings you to your God; and (as it were ſome new Maſter of the Ceremonies) inſtructs you how to woe, and court him likewiſe; but with approaches and diſtances, with geſtures and expreſſions ſuitable to a Diety; addreſſes clothed with ſuch a ſacred filial horror and reverence, as may invite and embolden the moſt deſpairing condition of the ſaddeſt gloomy Sinner; and withall daſh out of countenance the greateſt confidence of the moſt glorious Saint: and not with that blaſphemous familiarity  of our new-enlightned and inſpired men, who are as bold with the Majeſty and glory of that Light that is unaprochable, as with their own ignes fatui; and account of the third Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity for no more then their Fellow-Ghoſt; thinking him as much bound to them for their vertiginous blaſts and while-winds, as they to him for his own moſt holy Spirit. Your Authors then of theſe few ſheets are Prieſts, as well as Poets; who canteach you to pray inverſe, and (if there were not already too much phantasticknes in that Trade) to Preach likewiſe: while they turn Scripture-chapters into Odes, and both the Teſtaments into one book of Pſalmes: making Parnaſſns as ſacred as Mount Olivet, and the nine Muſes no leſſe religious then a Cloyſter of  Nuns. But yet for all this I would not have thee, Courteous Reader, paſs thy cenſure upon thoſe two Fountains of Religion and Learning, the Uviverſities, from theſe few ſmall drops of wit, as hardly as ſome have done upon the late Aſſemblies three-half-penny Catechiſme: as if all their publick and private Libraries, all their morning and evening watchings, all thoſe pangs and throwes of their Studies, were now at length delivered but of a Verſe, and brought to bed onely of five feet, and a Conceit. For although the judicious modeſty of theſe Men dares not look the world in the face with any of Theorau Johns Revelations, or thoſe glaring New-lights that have muffled the Times and Nation with a greater confuſion and darknes, then ever benighted  the world ſince the firſt Chaos: yet would they pleaſe bnt to inſtruct this ignorant Age with thoſe exact elaborate Pieces, which might reform Philoſophy without a Civil War, and new modell even Divinity its ſelfe without the tuine of either Chuch, or State; probably that moſt prudent and learned Order of the Church of Rome, the Jeſuite, ſhould not boaſt more ſollid, though more numerous Volums in this kind. And of this truth that Order was very ſenſible, when it felt the rational Divinity of one ſingle Chillingworth to be an unanſwerable twelve-years-task for all their Engliſh Colledges in Chriſendome. And therefore that Society did like its ſelfe, whe it ſent us over a War inſtead of an Anſwer, and proved us Hereticks by the ſword: which  in the firſt place was to Rout the Univerſities, and to teach our two Fountains of Learning better manners, then for ever heareafter to bubble and ſwell againſt the Apoſtolick Sea. And yet I know not whether the depth of their Politicks might not have adviſed to have kept thoſe Fountains within their own banks, and there to have dammd them and choakd them up with the mud of the Times, rather then to have let thoſe Proteſtant Streams run; which perchance may effect that now by the ſpreading Riverets, which they could never have done through the incloſed Spring: as it had been a deeper State-piece and Reach in that Sanedrim, the great Councell of the Jewiſh Nation, to have confined the Apoſtles to Jeruſalem, and there to have muzzeld them  with Oaths, and Orders; rather then by a fruitful Perſecution to ſcatter a few Goſpel Seeds, that would ſpring up the Religion of the whole world: which had it been Coopd within the walls of that City, might (for all they knew) in few years have expired and given up the ghoſt upon the ſame Golgotha with its Master. And as then every Pair of Fiſhermen made a Church and caught the ſixt part of the world in their Nets; ſo now every Pair of Celledge-fellows make as many ſeveral Ʋniverſityes; which are truly ſo call'd, in that they are Catholick, and ſpread over the face of the whole earth; which ſtands amazed, to ſee not onely Religion, but Learning alſo to come from beyond the Alpes; and that a poor deſpiſed Canton and nook of the world ſhould contain as much of each  as all the other Parts beſides. But then, as when our ſingle Jeſus was made an univerſall Saviour, and his particular Goſpel the Catholick Religion; though that Jeſus and this Goſpel did both take their riſe from the holy City; yet now no City is more unholy and infidel then that; inſomuch that there is at this day ſcarce any thing to be heard of a Chriſt at Jeruſalem, more then that ſuch a one was ſometimes there, nor any thing to be ſeen of his Goſpel, more then a Sepulcher: juſt ſo it is here with us; where though both Religion and Learning do owe their growth, as well as birth, to thoſe Nurſeryes of both, the Ʋniverſityes; yet, ſince the Siens of thoſe Nurſeryes have been tranſplanted, there's little remaines in them now (if they are not belyed) either of the old  Religion and Divinity, more then its empty Chair & Pulpit, or of the antient Learning & Arts, except bare Schools, and their gilded Superſcriptions: ſo far have we beggard our ſelves to enrich the whole world. And thus, Ingenuous Sir, have I given you the State and Condition of this Poetick Miſcellany, as alſo of the Authors; it being no more then ſome few Slips of the beſt Floriſts made up into a ſlender Garland, to crown them in their Pilgrimage, and refreſh thee in thine: if yet their very Pilgrimage be not its ſelfe a Crown equall to that of Confeſſors, and their Academicall Diſſolution a Reſurrection to the greateſt temporall glory: when they ſhall be approved of by men and Angels for a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, a peculiar People. In the interim let this  comfort be held out to you, our ſecluded Univerſity-members, by him that is none; (and therefore what hath been here ſpoken muſt not be interpreted as out of paſſion to my ſelf, but nicer zeal to my Mother) that according to the generally received Principles and Axioms of Policy, and the ſoundeſt Judgment of the moſt prudential States-men upon thoſe Principles, the daie of your ſad Oſtraciſme is expiring, and at an end; but yet ſuch an end, as ſome of you will not embrace when it ſhall be offered; but will chuſe rather to continue Peripateticks through the whole world, then to return, and be ſo in your own Colledges. For as that great Councell of Trent had a Form and Concluſion altogether contrary to the expectation and deſires of them that procured it; ſo our great Councels of  England (our late Parliaments) will have ſuch a reſult, and Cataſtrophe, as ſhall no ways anſwer the Faſts and Prayers, the Humiliations, and Thanks givings of their Plotters and Contrivers: ſuch a reſult I ſay, that will ſtrike a palſie through Mr. Pims aſhes, make his cold Marble ſweat; and put all thoſe ſeveral Partyes, and Actors, that have as yet appeard upon our tragical bloudy Stage, to an amazed ſtand and gaze: when they ſhall confeſs themſelves (but too late) to be thoſe improvident axes and hammers in the hand of a ſubtle Workman; whereby he was enabled to beat down, and ſquare out our Church and State into a Conformity with his own. And then it will appeare that the great Worke, and the holy Cauſe, and the naked Arme, ſo much talked of for  theſe fifteen years, were but the work, and the cauſe, and the arme of that Hand, which hath all this while reached us over the Alpes; dividing, and compoſing, winding us up, and letting us down, untill our very diſcords have ſet and tuned us to ſuch notes, both in our Eccleſiaſtical, and Civill Government; as may ſooneſt conduce to that moſt neceſſary Catholick Ʋniſon and Harmony, which is an eſſential part of Chriſts Church here upon Earth, and the very Church its ſelfe in Heaven. And thus far, Ingenuous Reader, ſuffer him to be a Poet in his Prediction, though not in his Verſe; who deſires to be known ſo far to thee, as that he is a friend to perſecuted Truth, and Peace; and thy moſt affectionate Chriſtian Servant,
Ab: Wright.

## The Temper. UPON Dr. JUXON Biſhop of LONDON.
Great Sir,ANd now more great then when you wereOth' Cabinet to your King, and Treaſurer.For then your acts were lock't from common viewYour life as Counſell being all Cloſet too;But now that Cabinet's opened, you doe paſſeTo th' world for the chiefe Jewel of the caſe:Each vertue ſhines a ſeveral glorious ſpark,Which then were but one Diamond in the dark.The Exchequer ſpeaks your faith, this you to beAs true to the Counſell-board as Treaſury; Which care oth' civill good when they ſhall viewThe houſes will repeal their act for you;And in their graver policy debateThe cloak leſſe fit for the Church, then th' gown for th' State.Next, to your place your low mind did accordSo well, you ſeem'd a Biſhop and no Lord.A Biſhop ſuch, as even the Scots to makeYou theirs would arme, and a new Covenant take;Disband the Presbitery, and henceforthInſtall you their ſole Patriarch of the North.Such power hath your ſoft Rhetorick, ſuch aweYour nod, and even your ſilence is a law;While others are not heard through their own noyſeAnd by their ſpeaking much have loſt their voyce:Thus thoſe oth' ſtarry Senate of the nightWhich ſloweſt tread their Orbs ſhine till moſt bright,And dart the ſtrongeſt influx; ſo concealThe flints cold veins a fire; ſuch is the zealOf recluſe Votaries, piercing the aireAnd yet not heard, and ſuch the Anchorites prayer.Not like our modern Zelots, whoſe bare nameIn Greek and Welch joyns language for a flame.Gun-powder ſouls, whoſe Pulpit thoughts createA calenture and feaver in the State;Whoſe plots and diſcipline are all fire, and ſhineAs hot, as if contrived under the line.Your tempers cool and Northern, calculateFor the Miridian of this clime and State;And may be fitly ſtil'd the Courts pole-ſtar,Or honours beſt morall Philoſopher: So juſt your Sovereigne's, tis a hard thingTo ſay, which was the Biſhop, which the King.This Temper took our State, by whom we ſeeThe order queſtion'd yet the Biſhop free:So that of all their Acts this ones moſt rare,A Church-man ſcape and a Lord Treaſurer.
## A Poem, Indefence of the decent Ornaments of Chriſt-Church Oxon, occaſioned by a Banbury brother, who called them Idolatries.
YOu that prophane our windows with a tongueSet like ſome clock on purpoſe to go wrong;Who when you were at Service ſigh'd, becauſeYou heard the Organs muſick not the Dawes:Pittying our ſolemn ſtate, ſhaking the headTo ſee no ruines from the flore to the lead:To whoſe pure noſe our Cedar gave offence,Crying it ſmelt of Papiſts frankincenſe:Who walking on our Marbles ſcoffing ſaidWhoſe bodies are under theſe Tombſtones laid:Counting our Tapers works of darkneſſe; andChooſing to ſee Prieſts in blew-aprons ſtandRather then in rich Coapes which ſhew the artOf Siſera's prey Imbrodred in each part:Then when you ſaw the Altars Baſon ſaidWhy's not the Ewer on the Cubboards head, Thinking our very Bibles too prophane,Cauſe you nere bought ſuch Covers in Ducklane.Loathing all decency, as if yould haveAltars as foule and homely as a Grave.Had you one ſpark of reaſon, you would findeYour ſelves like Idolls to have eyes yet blind.Tis onely ſome baſe niggard HereſieTo think Religion loves deformity.Glory did never yet make God the leſſe,Neither can beauty defile holineſſe.Whats more magnificent then Heaven? yet whereIs there more love and piety then there.My heart doth wiſh (wer't poſſible) to ſeePauls built with pretious ſtones and porphery:To have our Halls and Galleries outſhineAltars in beauty, is to deck our ſwineWith Orient Pearl, whilſt the deſerving QuireOf God and Angels wallow in the mire:Our decent Copes onely diſtinction keepThat you may know the Shepheard from the ſheep,As gaudy letters in the Rubrick ſhewHow you may holi-dayes from lay-dayes know:Remember Aarons Robes and you will ſayLadies at Maſques are not ſo rich as they.Then are th'Prieſts words like thunderclaps when heIs lightning like rayed round with Majeſty.May every Temple ſhine like thoſe of Nile,And ſtill be free from Rat or Crocodile.But you will urge both Prieſt and Church ſhould beThe ſolemn patternes of humility. Doe not ſome boaſt of raggs? Cynicks derideThe pomp of Kings but with a greater pride.Meekneſſe conſiſts not in the cloaths but heart,Nature may be vainglorious well as art;We way as lowly before God appearDreſt with a glorious pearl as with a tear;In his high preſence where the Stars and SunDoe but Ecclipſe ther's no ambition.You dare admit gay paint upon a wall,Why then in glaſſe that held Apocriphall?Our bodies Temples are: look in the eyeThe window, and you needs muſt pictures ſpye;Moſes and Aaron and the Kings armes areDaubed in the Church when you the Warden were.Yet you nere find for Papiſt: ſhall we ſayBanbury is turnd Rome, becauſe we maySee the holy Lamb and Chriſtopher? nay moreThe Altar ſtone ſet at the Tavern doore?Why can't the Oxe then in the nativityBe Imagd forth, but Papiſts Bulls are nigh?Our pictures to no other end are madeThen is your Time and ſith your death and ſpade;To us they'r but mementoes, which preſent▪Chriſt beſt, except his Word and Sacrament.If 'twere a ſin to ſet up Imagry,To get a Child were flat Idolary.The modells of our buildings would be thusDirections to our houſes, ruines to us.Hath not each creature which hath daily birthSomething which reſembles Heaven or Earth? Suppoſe ſome ignorant Heathen once did bowTo Images, may we not ſee them now?Should we love darkneſſe and abhor the SunCauſe Perſians gave it adoration?And plant no Orchards, becauſe apples firſtMade Adam and his lineall race accurſt?Though wine for Bacchus, bread for Ceres went,Yet both are now uſed in the Sacrament.What then if theſe were Popiſh reliques? fewWindowes are elſewhere old but theſe are new,And ſo exceed the former, that the faceOf thoſe come ſhort of the outſide of our glaſs;Colours are here mix'd ſo, that Rainbows be(Compared) but clouds without variety.Art here is Natures envy: this is he,Not Paracelſus, that by ChymiſtryCan make a man from aſhes, if not duſt,Producing off-ſprings of his mind not luſt.See how he makes his maker, and doth drawAll that is meant ith' Goſpel, or ith' Law:Looking upon the ReſurrectionMe thoughts I ſaw the bleſſed viſion,Where not his face is meerly drawn but mind,Which not with paint but oile of gladneſs ſhind:But when I viewed the next pane, where we haveThe God of life tranſported to his grave,Light then is dark, all things ſo dull and dead;As if that part of the window had been lead.Jonas his whale did ſo mens eyes befoolThat they'd have begd him for th' Anatomy School. That he ſaw Ships at Oxford one did ſwear,Though Iſis yet will Barges hardly bear.Another ſoon as he the trees eſpiedThought them i'th Garden on the other ſide.See in what ſtate (though on an Aſſe) Chriſt went,This ſhews more glorious then the Parliament.Then in what awe Moſes his rod doth keepThe Seas, as if a froſt had glaz'd the deep;The raging waves are to themſelves a bound;Some cry help help or horſe and man are drownd.Shadows doe every where for ſubſtance paſſe,You'd think the ſands were in a houre-glaſſe.You that do live with Chirurgeons, have you ſeenA ſpring of blood forſt from a ſwelling vein?So from a touch of Moſes rod doth jumpA Chataract, the rock is made a pump:At ſight of whoſe oreflowings many getThemſelves away for fear of being wet.Have you beheld a ſprightfull Lady ſtandTo have her frame drawn by a painters hand?Such lively look and preſence, ſuch a dreſſeKing Pharoahs Daughters Image doth expreſſe;Look well upon her Gown and you will ſwearThe needle not the pencill hath been there:At ſight of her ſome gallants doe diſputeWhether ith' Church 'tis lawfull to ſalute.Next Jacob kneeling, where his Kids-ſkins ſuchAs it may well coſen old Iſaacs touch:A Shepheard ſeeing how thorns went round aboutAbrahams ram, would needs have helpt it out. Behold the Dove deſcending to inſpireThe Apoſtles heads with cloven tongues of fire,And in a ſuperficies there youle ſeeThe groſſe dimentions of profundity:Tis hard to judge which is beſt built and higherThe arch-roofe in the window or the Quire.All beaſts as in the Ark are lively done,Nay you may ſee the ſhadow of the Sun.Upon a landskip if you look a whileYoule think the proſpect at leaſt forty mile.There's none needs now goe travell, we may ſeeAt home Jeruſalem and Ninevy;And Sodome now in flames: one glance will dartFarther then Lynce with Galilaeus art.Seeing Eliahs Chariot, we feareThere is ſome fiery prodigy in the aire.When Chriſt to purge his Temple holds his whipHow nimbly huckſters vvith their baskets skip.St. Peters fiſhes are ſo lively wrought,Some cheapen them and ask when they were caught.Here's motion painted too: Chariots ſo faſtRun, that they're never gone though always paſt.The Angels with their Lutes are done ſo true,We doe not onely look but hearken too,As if their ſounds were painted: thus the witOf the pencil hath drawn more then there can ſit.Thus as (in Archimedes ſphear) you mayIn a ſmall glaſſe the univerſe ſurvey:Such various ſhapes are too ith' ImagryAs age and ſex may their own features ſee. But if the window cannot ſhew your faceLook under feet the Marble is your glaſſe,Which too for more then Ornament is thereThe ſtones may learn your eyes to ſhed a tear:Yet though their lively ſhadows delude ſenceThey never work upon the conſcience;They cannot make us kneel; we are not ſuchAs think theres balſome in their kiſſe or touch,That were groſſe ſuperſtition we know;There is no more power in them then the Popes toe.The Saints themſelves for us can doe no good,Muchleſs their pictures drawn in glaſs and wood,They cannot ſeale, but ſince they ſignifieThey may be worthy of a caſt oth' eye,Although no worſhip: that is due aloneNot to the Carpenters but Gods own Sonne:Obedience to blocks deſerves the rod;The Lord may well be then a jealous God.Why ſhould not Statues now be due to Paul,As to the Caeſars of the Capitall.How many Images of great heires, whichHad nothing but the ſin of being rich,Shine in our Temples? kneeling alwayes thereWhere when they were alive theyd ſcarce appear.Yet ſhall Chriſts Sepulcher have nere a Tomb?Shall every Saint ſuffer John Baptiſts doom?No limb of Mary ſtand? muſt we forgetChriſts croſs as ſoon as paſt the Alphabet?Shall not their heads have room in the window whoFounded our Church and our Religion too? We know that Gods a Spirit, we confeſſeThoughts cannot comprehend his name, muchleſsCan a ſmall glaſſe his nature: but ſince heVouchſaf'd to ſuffer his humanity,Why may not we (onely to puts in mindOf his Godhead) have his manhood thus enſhrind?Is our Kings perſon leſſe eſteemd becauſeWe read him in our Coynes as well as Laws?Doe what we can, whether we think or paint,All Gods expreſſions are but weak and faint.Yet ſpots in Globes muſt not be blotted thenceThat cannot ſhew the worlds magnificence.Nor is it fit we ſhould the skill controulBecauſe the Artiſt cannot draw the ſoul.Ceaſe then your railings and your dull complaints;To pull down Galleries and ſet up SaintsIs no impiety: now we may wellSay that our Church is truely viſible:Thoſe that before our glaſſe ſcaffolds prefer,Would turne our Temple to a theater.Windows are Pulpits now; though unlearnd, oneMay read this Bibles new Edition.Inſtead of here and there a verſe adorndRound with a lace of paint, fit to be ſcorndEven by vulgar eyes, each pane preſentsWhole chapters with both comment and contents,The cloudy myſteries of the Goſpel hereTransparent as the Chriſtall doe appear.Tis not to ſee things darkly through a glaſſe,Here you may ſee our Saviour face to face. And whereas Feaſts come ſeldome, here's deſcrideA conſtant Chriſmas, Eaſter, Whitſontide.Let the deafe hither come; no matter thoughFaiths ſence be loſt, we a new way can ſhew:Here we can teach them to believe by the eye;Theſe ſilenced Miniſters doe edify:The Scriptures rayes contracted in a GlaſſeLike Emblems doe with greater vertue paſſe.Look in the book of Martyrs and youle ſeeMore by the Pictures then the Hiſtory.That price for things in colours oft we giveWhich wee'd not take to have them while they live.Such is the power of painting that it makesA loving ſympathy twixt men and ſnakes.Hence then Pauls doctrin may ſeem more divine▪As Amber through a Glaſſe doth clearer ſhine.Words paſſe away, as ſoon as heard are gone;We read in books what here we dwell upon,Thus then there's no more fault in ImagryThen there is in the Practiſe of piety,Both edifie: what is in letters thereIs writ in plainer Hierogliphicks here.Tis not a new Religion we have choſe;Tis the ſame body but in better cloaths.Youle ſay they make us gaze when we ſhould prayAnd that our thoughts doe on the figures ſtray:If ſo, you may conclude us beaſts, what theyHave for their object is to us the way.Did any ere uſe proſpectives to ſeeNo farther then the Glaſſe: or can there be Such lazy travellers, ſo given to ſin,As that theyle take their dwelling at the Inne.A Chriſtians ſight reſts in Divinity,Signes are but ſpectacles to help faiths ey,God is the Center: dwelling one theſe words,My muſe a Sabbath to my brain affords.If their nice wits more ſolemn proof exact,Know this was meant a Poem not a Tract.
## An ELEGIE, Ʋpon the death of Sir John Burrowes, Slaine at the Iſle of Ree.
OH wound us not with this ſad tale, forbearTo preſs our grief too much, we cannot hearThis all at once, ſuch heavy newes as theſeMuſt be ſunk gently into us by degrees:Say Burrowes is but hurt, let us diſgeſtThis firſt, then try our patience for the reſt.Practiſe us firſt in lighter griefes, that weMay grow at laſt ſtrong for this Tragedy.Doe not ſpeak yet he's ſlaine, or if he beSpeak't in a whiſper or uncertainty,As ſome new unauthoriz'd buzze withoutReaſon or warrant to confirme our doubt.Come tis not ſo, tis but ſome flying talkNewes lately vented in the audacious walk, Some lye thats drapt in Pauls to ſtur our fears,And gatherd by the buſie credulous eares.Will you believe ought comes from thence? why thereThe Forts ſurrendred, and the RochellereSworne Engliſh, Tillyes ſlaine, the hoſtile KingsCloſed in our ſiege, with ſuch prodigious things,Which your perſwaded vulgar takes and ſendsAbroad as tokens to their country friends.Are all theſe wonders falſe? and onely thisTrue mongſt ſo many impoſſibilities?Where truth is worſe then any forgeryThere we may curſe his mouth that doth not lye,When fame goes off with ſuch a black reportWorſe then the murthering Canon from the fort,Worſe then the ſhot that killd him, for but oneWas killd with that, this kills a Nation.Ile not believe it yet, doe we not knowAn envious murder fam'd him dead ere now;Receiv'd went into Ballads and almoſtClap'd in Caranto's upon every poſt:Why ſhould he not now dye in jeſt as then,And we as haply be mock'd agen?But tis too certaine, here his Coarſe we haveCome ore to prove his death and ask a Grave,A Grave for his good ſervice: onely thusMuſt we reward thee that waſt ſlaine for us,To mourn and bury thee? and would our fearsAs ſoon were clos'd too as thy duſt and tears.I would thou mightſt dye wholly here, and beForgotten, rather then our miſery Should urge thy freſh remembrance, and recallOur ſorrows often to lament thy fall,When we ſhall ſay hereafter, tis well ſeenBurrowes is dead elſe this had never been.Why did we thus expoſe thee, whats now allThat Iſland to requite thy Funerall;Though thouſand troops of murdered French doe lyeIt may revenge, it cannot ſatifie:They are before hand ſtill, and when we have doneOur worſt we are looſers though the Fort be won:Our conquerers now will weep, when they ſhall ſeeThis price too dear to buy a victory:He whoſe brave fire gave heat to all the reſtThat dealt his ſpirits in each Engliſh breaſt;From whoſe divided vertues you might takeSo many Captaines out and fully makeThem each accompliſht with thoſe parts the whichDid joyntly his rare furniſh'd ſoule enrich:He whoſe command was ore himſelfe more highAnd ſtrictly ſoure then ore his company:Not raſhly valiant nor yet fearfull wiſe,His flame had counſell in't, his fury eyes,Not ſtruck with courage at the drums proud beatOr made fierce onely by the Trumpets heat:When even pale hearts above their pitch doe flyAnd for a while doe mad it furiouſly:His rage was temper'd well, no fear could dantHis reaſon his cold blood was valiant.Alaſſe thoſe vulgar praiſes injure thee,Which now a Poet would as plenteouſly Give ſome boy ſouldier, one that nere knew moreThen the fine Scabbard and the Scarfe he wore.And we can pitch no higher; thou haſt outdoneSo much our fancy and invention,It cannot give thee ought. He that of theeShall write but halfe ſeems to write Poetry:It is a ſtrong line here to ſpeak yet true,Hyperboles in others is thy due.Suffice it that thou wert our Armies all;Whoſe well tryed name did more the French appallThen all their wants could do, whoſe inward dreadFamiſh'd them more in courage then in bread:And we may make't a Queſtion, whether moſtBeſiegd their Caſtle, Burrowes, or our Hoſt.Now let me blame thy vertue, it was thisTook thee from us and not our enemies.Whilſt thy unwearied toyle no reſpite takesAnd thinks reſt ſloath, and with parpetual wakesContinueſt night with day and day with night;Thou waſt more ventrous when thou didſt not fight.This did expoſe thee to their fraud and mark;They durſt not ſeize upon thee but ith' dark:The coward bullet that ſo oft beforeWaved thy bold face and did fear thee moreThen thou feardſt it, now by its errour isAimed too too ſure: There was no light to miſſe.Thus fell our Captaine, and the ſound be's deadHas fallen as deep; and like that fatall leadLies cold on us. Yet this thy honour be,Thy hurts our wound, thy death our miſery. Not as the mourning of a private fateBut as ſome ruine had befallen the State:The Fleet had been miſcarried, Denmark taneOr the Palatinate been loſt againe.So we with down-caſt looks aſtoniſhd quiteReceiv'd this not as newes but as a fright:So we relate thy death, whilſt each man hereContributes to this publick loſſe a teare:Whilſt Fathers tell their children this was he;And they hereafter to poſterityRange with thoſe Forces that ſcourg'd France of oldBurrowes and Talbots name together told.VVhilſt we ad this to our quarrel, and now moreFight to revenge thee then our Land before.
## On a white blemiſh in his Miſtreſſe eye.

THe mighty zeal which thou haſt late put on;Neither by Prophet nor by Prophets ſonAs yet prevented, doth tranſport me ſoBeyond my ſelfe, that though I nere could goFar in a Verſe, and have all rimes defiedSince Hopkins and good Thomas Sternhold died,Except it were the little paines I tookTo pleaſe good people in a Prayer-bookThat I ſet forth, or ſo: yet muſt I raiſeMy ſpirits for thee, who ſhall in thy praiſeGird up her loyns and furiouſly runneAll kind of feet but Satans cloven one. Such is thy zeal, ſo well thou doſt expreſſe it▪That wer't not like a charme I'd ſay God bleſs it.I needs muſt ſay it is a ſpirituall thingTo raile againſt the Biſhop and the King:But theſe are private quarrells, this doth fallWithin the compaſſe of the Generall.Whether it be a Pole painted or wrought,Far otherwiſe then from the wood 'twas brought:Whoſe head the Idol-makers hand doth crop;Where a prophane bird towring on the topLooks like the Calfe in Horeb, at whoſe rootThe unyoakt youth doth exerciſe his foot:Or whether it preſerves its boughs befriendedBy neighbouring buſhes and by them attended,How canſt thou chuſe but ſeeing it complaineThat Baals worſhip'd in the Groves againe:Tell me how curſt an egging with a ſtingOf luſt doe theſe unwily dances bring,The ſimple wretches ſay they mean no harmeThey don't indeed, but yet thoſe actions warmeOur purer blood the more: For Satan thusTempts us the more that are more righteous.Oft hath a Brother moſt ſincerely goneStifled with zeal and contemplation,When lighting on the place where ſuch repaireHe views the Nimph and is clean out in his prayer:Oft hath a Siſter grounded in a truth,Seeing the jolly carriage of the youth,Been tempted to the way thats broad and bad;And wert not for our private pleaſures, had Renounced her little ruffe and goggle eyeAnd quit her ſelfe of the fraternity.What is the mirth? what is the mellodyThat ſets them in this Gentiles vanity?When in our Synagogues we raile at ſin,And tell men of the faults that they are in,With hand and voyce ſo following our theamsThat we put out the ſides men in their dreams:Sounds not the Pulpit then which we belaborBetter and holier then doth a Tabor;Yet ſuch is unregenerate mans folly,He loves the wicked noyſe, and hates the holy.If the ſins ſweet enticing, and the bloodWhich now begins to boyl, have thought it goodTo challenge liberty and recreationLet it be done in holy contemplation;Brother and Siſter in the field may walk,Beginning of the holy word to talk,Of David and Ʋriahs lovely wifeOf Thamar and her luſtfull Brothers ſtrife,Then underneath the hedge that is the nextThey may ſit down and ſo act out the Text.Nor doe we want, how ere we live auſtere,In winter Sabbath nights ſome luſty cheare;And though the Paſtors grace which oft doth holdHalfe an houre long make the proviſion cold,We can be merry thinking nere the worſeTo mend the matter at the ſecond courſe;Chapters are read and Hymns are ſweetly ſungJoyntly commanded by the noſe and tongue: Then on the word we diverſly dilateWrangling indeed for heat of zeale, not hate,When at the length an unappeaſed doubtFiercely comes in, and then the lights go out.Darkneſſe thus makes our peace, and we containeOur fiery ſpiits till we meet againe:Till then no voyce is heard, no tongue does goUnleſſe a tender Siſter ſhreek or ſo.Such ſhould be our delights grave and demure,Not ſo abominable, and impureAs thoſe thou ſeekſt to hinder: but I fearSatan will be too ſtrong, his kingdomes there.Few are the righteous, nor doe I knowHow we this Idol here ſhall overthrow,Since our ſincereſt Patron is deceaſ'dThe number of the righteous is decreaſ'd:But we doe hope theſe times will on and breedA faction mighty for us. For indeedWe labour all, and every Siſter joynesTo have regenerate babes ſpring from our loyns:Beſides what many carefully have doneTo get the unrighteous man a righteous ſon.Then ſtoutly on, let not thy flocks range lewdlyIn their old vanities, thou lamp of Beudly.One thing I pray thee; doe not ſo much thirſtAfter Idolatries laſt fall, but firſtFollow thy ſuite more cloſe, let it not goTill it be thine as thou woulſt have't: for ſoThy ſucceſſors upon the ſame entaileHereafter may take up the Whitſun-ale.
## On Mr. Sambourne, ſometime Sherife of Oxford-ſhire.
FIe, Schollers, fie, have you ſuch thirſty ſoulsTo ſwill, quaffe, and carouſe in Samborns bouls.Tell me, mad youngſters, what doe you believeIt coſt good Sambourne nothing to be Sheriffe?To ſpend ſo many beeves, ſo many weathers,Maintaine ſo many Caps, ſo many Feathers.Againe is malt ſo cheap, this pinching year,That you ſhould make ſuch havock of his bear:I hear you are ſo many, that you makeMoſt of his men turne Tapſters for your ſake.And that when he even at the Bench doth ſit,You ſnatch the meat from off the hungry ſpit:You keep ſuch hurly burly, that it paſſes,Ingurgitating ſometimes whole halfe glaſſes.And ſome of you, forſooth, are grown ſo fine,Or elſe ſo ſaucy, as to call for wine;As if the Sheriffe had put ſuch men in truſt,As durſt draw out more wine then needs they muſt.In faith, in faith, it is not well my Maſters,Nor fit that you ſhould be the Shrieffs taſters.It were enough, you being ſuch gormondizers,To make the Shrieffs hence forth turn arrant miſers Remove the Size, to Oxfords foul diſgrace,To Henly on the Thames, or ſome ſuch place.He never had complained had it beenA petty Ferkin, or a Kilderkin:But when a Barrel daily is drunk out,My Maſters, then tis time to look about.Is this a lye? trow ye, I tell you no,My Lord High-Chancelor was informed ſo.And oh, what would not all the bread in TownSuffice to drive the Sheriffs liquor down:But he in hampers muſt it from hence bring;Oh moſt prodigious, and moſt monſtrous thing!Upon ſo many loaves of home-made bread,How long might he and his two men have fed?He would no doubt the poor they ſhould be fedWith the ſweet morſells of his broken bread:But when that they poor ſoules for bread did call,Anſwer was made, the Schollers eate up all:And when for broken bear, they cravd a cup,Anſwer was made, the Schollers drunk it up.And thus I know not how they change the name,Cut did the deed, and long-tale bore the blame.

## A journey into France.
I Went from England into France,Not for to learn to ſing or dance,Nor yet to ride nor fence.Nor yet did goe like one of thoſe,That thence returne with halfe the noſeThey carried from hence.But I to Paris rode along,Much like John Dory in the ſong,Upon a holy tide.I on an ambling Nagge did get,I truſt he is not paid for yet.Aud ſpur'd him on each ſide.And to St. Dennis firſt we came,To ſee the ſights of Nostredam,The man that ſhewes them ſnuffles.Where who is apt for to believe,May ſee our Ladies right arme ſleeve,And eke her old pantafles.Her breſt, her milk, her very gown,That ſhe did weare in Bethlem Town,When in the Inne ſhe lay.No Carpenter could by his tradeGaine ſo much coyn as to have madeA Gown of ſo rich ſtuffe. Yet they poor fooles think't worth their credit,They muſt believe old Joſeph did it,Cauſe he deſerv'd enough.There is one of the Croſſes Nailes,Whcih who ſo ſees his Bonnet vailes,And if he will may kneel.Some ſay tis falſe twas never ſo;Yet feeling it thus much I know,It is as true as ſteel.There is the Ianthorn which the Jewes,When Judas led them forth did uſe,It weighs my weight down-right.But to believe it you muſt think,The Jewes did put a candle in't,And then twas wondrous light.There's one Saint there hath loſt his noſe,Another his head, but not his toes,His elbow and a thumb.But when we had ſeen theſe holy rags,We went to the Inne and took our Nags,And ſo away did come.We came to Paris on the Sene,Tis wondrous faire, but nothing cleane,Tis Europes greateſt Town.How ſtrong it is I need not tell it,For all the world may eaſily ſmell it,That walk it up and down. There many ſtrange things are to ſee,The Pallace, the great GalleryThe Pallace doth excell.The New-bridge, and Statues there:At Nostredam St. Chriſtopher,The Steeple bears the bell.For learning the Univerſity;And for old cloths the Frippery,The houſe the Queen did build.St. Innocents whoſe earth devoursDead corps in four and twenty hours,And there the King was kil'd.The Baſteel, and St. Dennis ſtreet,The Shatteet juſt like London Fleet,The Arſenall no toy.But if you'l ſee the prettieſt thing,Go to the Court and ſee the King,Oh tis a hopefull boy.He is of all his Dukes and Peers,Reverencd for his wit and years:Nor muſt you think it much.For he with little ſwitch can play,And can make fine durt Pies of clay,Oh never King made ſuch.A Bird that can but kill a fly,Or prate, doth pleaſe his Mageſty,Tis known to every one.The Duke of Guiſe gave him a Parrot,And he had twenty Cannons for it,For his great Gallioone. Oh that I ere might have the hapTo get that Bird which in the MapIs call'd the Indian Duck;I'd give it him, and hope to beAs great as Guiſe or Liciny,Or elſe I had bad luck.Birds about his Chamber ſtand,And he them feeds with his own hand;Tis his humility:And if they doe want any thing,They need but whiſtle for their King,And he comes preſently.But now for theſe good parts he muſtNeeds be inſtil'd Lewis the juſt,Great Henryes lawfull heire.When to his ſtile to adde more words,They had better call him King of Birds,Then of the loſt Navarre.He has beſides a pretty firke,Taught him by nature how to workIn Iron with much eaſe:Sometimes into the Forge he goes,And there he knocks, and there he blows,And makes both locks and keys.Which puts a doubt in every one,Where he be Mars or Vulcans ſon;Some few believe his mother,Yet let them all ſay what they will,I am reſolv'd and doe think ſtill,As much the one or t'other. The people don't diſlike the youth,Alleging reaſons. For in truthMothers ſhould honoured be.Yet others ſay he loves her rather,As well as ere ſhe lov'd his Father,And thats notoriouſly.His Queen a little pretty wench,Was born in Spaine, ſpeaks little French,Nere like to be a Mother:For her inceſtuous houſe could notHave children unleſſe they were begotBy Uncle or by Brother.Now why ſhould Lewis being ſo juſt,Content himſelfe to take his luſt,With his Licina's mate:And ſuffer his little pretty Queen,From all her race that ere has beenSo to degenerate.Twere charity for to be knownTo love ſtrange chlldren as his own;And why it is no ſhame:Unleſſe he yet would greater be,Then was his Father Henry,Who ſome thought did the ſame

Yet when of friendſhip I would draw the face,A letterd mind, and a large heart would placeTo all poſterity, I would write Burlace.

The leaſt work of manIs better then his word; but if we ſcanGods word aright, his works far ſhort doe fall:The word is God, the works are creatures all.The ſundry peeces of this generall frameAre dimmer letters, all which ſpell the ſameEternall word. But theſe cannot expreſſeHis greatneſſe with ſuch eaſie readineſſe,And therefore yeeld.

Once more this mighty word his people greets,Thus lappd and thus ſwath'd up in Paper ſheets.Read here Gods Image with a zealous eye,The legible and written Deity.

All other proofes are vaine, go not about;We two will embrace, and love, and clear the doubt.When you have brought forth your like the world will knowYou are his Child; what Picture can doe ſo?

O Thou deformed unwomanlike deſeaſe!That ploweſt up fleſh and blood and ſoweſt there peaſe;And leav'ſt ſuch prints on beauty if thou come,As clouted ſhoon doe in a floare of loame:Thou that of faces honicombs doſt make,And of two breaſts two cullinders; forſakeThy deadly trade, thou now art rich, give oreAnd let our curſes call thee forth no more,Or if thou needs wilt magnifie thy powerGoe where thou art invoked every hour Amongſt the gameſters, where they name thee thickAt the laſt man or the laſt pocky nick.Thou who haſt ſuch ſuperfluous ſtore of gaine,Why ſtrikſt thou one whoſe ruine is thy ſhame?O thou haſt murdred where thou ſhouldſt have kiſt,And where thy ſhaft was needful, there thou miſt.Thou ſhouldſt have choſen out ſome homely faceWhere thy ill-favourd kindneſs might add grace,That men might ſay, how beautious once was ſhe,And what a curious piece was mard by thee:Thou ſhouldſt have wrought on ſome ſuch Lady-mouldThat never loved her Lord nor ever couldUntill ſhe were deformed; thy tyrannyWere then within the rules of charity.But upon one whoſe beauty was aboveAll ſorts of art, whoſe love was more then love.On her to fix thy ugly counterfeit,Was to erect a Piramid of jet,And put out fire; to dig a turfe from Hell,And place it where a gentle ſoule ſhould dwell▪A ſoule which in the body would not ſtay,When twas no more a body, nor pure clay,But a huge ulcer; o thou heavenly race,Thou ſoule that ſhunſt the infection of thy caſe,Thy houſe, thy priſon, pure ſoule, ſpotleſs faire,Reſt where no heat, no cold, no compounds are▪Reſt in that country, and enjoy that eaſe,Which thy fraile fleſh denied, and thy diſeaſe.

## An Ode in the praiſe of Sack.
 
*1.HEar me as if thy eares had palate Jack,I ſing the praiſe of Sack:Hence with Apollo and the muſes nine,Give me a cup of wine.Sack will the ſoule of Poetry infuſe,Be that my theam and muſe.But Bacchus I adore no Diety,Nor Bacchus neither unleſſe Sack he be. 
*2.Let us by reverend degrees draw nere,I feel the Goddeſſe here.Loe I, dread Sack, an humble Prieſt of thineFirſt kiſſe this cup thy ſhrine,That with more hallowed lips and inlarg'd ſouleI may receive the whole:Till Sibill-like full with my God I lye,And every word I ſpeak be Propehſie. 
*3.Come to this Altar you that are oppreſt,Or otherwiſe diſtreſt,Here's that will further grivances prevent,Without a Parliament:With fire from hence if once your blood be warm feelNothing can doe you harme;When thou art arm'd with Sack, thou canſt notThough thunder ſtrike thee; that hath made thee ſteel. 
*4.Art ſick man? doe not bid for thy eſcapeA cock to Aeſculape;If thou wouldſt proſper, to this Altar bringThy gratefull offring,Touch but the ſhrine, that does the God encloſe,And ſtreight thy feaver goesWhilſt thou immaginſt this, hee's given theeNot onely heath but immortality. 
*5.Though thou wert dumb as is the ſcaly fryIn Neptunes royalty:Drink but as they doe, and new wayes ſhalt findTo utter thy whole mind;When Sack more ſeverall language has infuſ'dThen Babels builders uſed: And whenſoever thou thy voyce ſhalt raiſe,No man ſhall underſtand but all ſhall praiſe. 
*6.Hath cruell nature ſo thy ſenſes boundThou canſt not judge of ſounds?Loe where yon narrow fountaine ſcatters forthStreams of an unknown worth:The heavenly muſick of that murmure thereWould make thee turne all eare;And keeping time with the harmonious flood,Twixt every bubble thou ſhalt cry good good. 
*7.Has fortune made thee poor, doſt thou deſireTo heap up glorious mire?Come to this ſtream where every drop's a PearlMight buy an Earl:Drench thy ſelfe ſoundly here and thou ſhalt riſeRicher then both the Indies.So mayeſt thou ſtill enjoy with full contentMidas his wiſh without his puniſhment. 
*8.All this can Sack, and more then this Sack can,Give me a fickle manThat would be ſomewhat faine but knows not what,There is a cure for that: Let him quaffe freely of this powerfull flood,He ſhall be what he would.To all our wiſhes Sack content does bring,And but our ſelves can make us every thing.

ENter and ſee this tomb (Sirs) doe not fearNo ſpirits but of Sack will fright you here:Weep ore this tomb, your waters here may haveWine for their ſweet companion in this grave.A dozen Shakeſpears here inter'd doe lye;Two dozen Johnſons full of Poetry.Unhappy Grapes could not one preſſing doe,But now at laſt you muſt be buried too:Twere commendable ſacriledge no doubtCould I come at your graves to ſteal you out.Sleep on but ſcorne to dye, immortall liquor,The burying of thee thus ſhall make thee quicker.Mean while thy friends pray loud that thou maiſt haveA ſpeedy reſurrection from thy grave.
## How to chooſe a Miſtreſſe.
HEr for a Miſtreſſe would I faine enjoyThat hangs out lip and pouts at every toy;Speaks like a wag, is bold; dares ſtoutly ſtandAnd bids love welcome with a wanton hand:If ſhe be modeſt wiſe and chaſt of life,Hang her ſhe's good for nothing but a wife.
## Ʋpon a Picture.
BEhold thoſe faire eyes, in whoſe ſightSparkles a luſtre no leſſe brightThen that of riſing Stars when theyWould make the night outſhine the day.To thoſe pure lips the humming be,May as to blooming Roſes flee:The wanton wind about doth hurle,Courting in vaine that lovely curle;And makes a murmure in deſpaire,To dally the unmooved haire.View but the cheeks where the red RoſeAnd Lilly white a beauty growes, So orient as might adorneThe flowing of the brighteſt morne.Sure 'tis no Picture, nere was madeSo much perfection in a ſhade:Her ſhape is ſoule enough to giveA ſenceleſſe Marble power to live.If this an Idoll be, no eyeCan ever ſcape Idolatry.
## On Ladies Attire.
YOu Ladies that wear Cypreſſe vailes,Turn'd lately to white linnen rayles;And to your girdles wear your bands,And ſhew your armes inſtead of hands.What could you doe in Lent ſo meetAs, fitteſt dreſſe, to wear a ſheet?Twas once a band, tis now a cloak;A acorne one day proves a oak.Weare but your linnens to your feetAnd then the band will be a ſheet.By which device and wiſe exceſſeYou doe your pennance in a dreſſe:And none ſhall know by what they ſeeWhich Ladies cenſur'd, and which free.
## The Anſwer.
BLack Cypreſſe vailes are ſhrowds of night,White linnen railes are rayes of light,Which to our girdles though we wearWe have armes to keep your hands off there.Who makes our bands to be our cloak,Makes John a ſtiles of John a noak.We wear our linnen to our feet,Yet need not make our band our ſheet▪Your Clergy wear as long as we,Yet that implies conformity.Be wiſe, recant what you have writ,Leaſt you doe pennance for your wit;And leaſt loves charmes doe weave a ſtringTo tye you as you did your ring.
## On a Gentlewoman that had the Small-Pox.
A Beauty ſmoother then the Ivory plaine,Late by the Pox injuriouſly was ſlaine.Twas not the Pox, love ſhot a thouſand dartsAnd made thoſe pits for graves to bury hearts:But ſince that beauty hath regaind its light,Thoſe hearts are doubly ſlaine it ſhines ſo bright.
## On a faire Gentlewomans blistered lip.
HIde not your ſprouting lip, nor killThe juicie bloom with baſhfull skill▪Know it is an amorous dewThat ſwells to court your corall hew.And what a blemiſh you eſteemTo other eyes a Pearl may ſeem;Whoſe watry growth is not aboveThe thrifty ſeize which Pearls doe love: And doth ſo well become that partThat chance may ſeem a ſecret art:Doth any judge the face leſſe faireWhoſe tender ſilk a moral doth bear?Are apples thought leſſe ſound and ſweetWhen honey ſpecks and red doe meet?Or will a Diamond ſhine leſſe clearIf in the midſt a ſoile appear?Then is your lip made fairer bySuch ſweetneſſe of deformity.The Nectar which men ſtrive to ſipSprings like a well upon your lip.Nor doth it ſhew immodeſty,But overflowing chaſtity.O who will blame the fruitfull treesWhen too much gum or ſap he ſees?Here nature from her ſtore doth ſendOnely what other parts can lend.If lovely buds aſcend ſo high,The root below cannot be dry.
## To his Mistreſſe.
KEepe on your mask and hide your eye,For in beholding you I dye.Your fatall beauty Gorgon-likeDead with aſtoniſhment doth ſtrike. Your piercing eyes that now I ſeeAre worſe then Baſilisks to me.Shut from mine eyes thoſe hills of ſnow,Their melting vally doe not ſhew:Thoſe azure pathes lead to diſpaire,Oh vex me not, forbear, forbear;For while I thus in torments dwell,The ſight of Heaven is worſe then Hell.In thoſe faire cheeks two pits doe lyeTo bury thoſe ſlaine by your eye:So this at length doth comfort me,That fairely buried I ſhall be:My grave with Roſes, Lillies, ſpread,Methinks tis life for to be dead:Come then and kill me with your ye,For if you let me live, I dye.When I perceive your lips againeRecover thoſe your eyes have ſlaine,With kiſſes that (like balſome pure)Deep wounds as ſoon as made doe cure;Methinks tis ſickneſſe to be ſound,And theres no health to ſuch a wound.When in your boſome I beholdTwo hills of ſnow yet never cold:Which lovers, whom your beauty kills,Revive by climing thoſe your hills.Methinks theres life in ſuch a deathThat gives a hope of ſweeter breath.Then ſince one death prevailes not whereSo many Antidotes are nere: And your bright eyes doe but in vaineKill thoſe who live as faſt as ſlaine;That I no more ſuch death ſurvive,Your way's to bury me aliveIn place unknown, and ſo that IBeing dead may live and living dye.
## A lover to one diſpraiſing his Mistreſſe.
WHy ſlight you her whom I approve▪Thou art no peere to try my love;Nor canſt diſcerne where her forme lies,Unleſſe thou ſaweſt her with my eyesSay ſhe were foule, or blacker thenThe night, or Sun burnt African;If lik't by me, 'tis I aloneCan make a beauty where there's none:For rated in my fancy ſheIs ſo as ſhe appears to me.Tis not the feature or a faceThat doth my faire Election grace.Nor is my fancy onely ledBy a well temper'd white and red;Could I enamour'd grow on thoſe,The Lilly and the bluſhing Roſe United in one ſtalk might beAs dear unto my thoughts as ſhe,But I look farther and doe findA richer beauty in her mind:Where ſomething is ſo laſting faire,As time and age cannot impaire.Hadſt thou a proſpective ſo cleareThat thou couldſt view my object there;When thou her vertues didſt eſpy,Thoudſt wonder and confeſſe that IHad cauſe to like; and learne from henceTo love by judgement, not by ſence.
## On the death of a faire Gentlewomans Robin-redbreſt.
WHatſoere birds in groves are bredProvide your anthems, Robins dead.Poor Robin that was wont to neſtIn faire Siloras lovely breſt,And thence would peep into her eye,To ſee what feather ſtood awry.This pretty bird might freely ſipThe ſugered Nectar from her lip.When many love-burnt ſoules have pinedTo ſee their rivall ſo retained. But what cauſed Robins death was this,Robin ſure ſurfeited with bliſſe;Or elſe cauſe her faire cheek-poſſeſtA purer red then Robins breſt,Wherein conſiſted all his pride,The little bird for envy dyed.
## On the death of Sir Tho: Pelham.
MEerely for death to grieve and mourneWere to repine that man was borne.When weak old age doth fall aſleep'Twere foul ingratitude to weep.Thoſe threds alone ſhould force out tearsWhoſe ſuddain crack breaks off ſome years.Here 'tis not ſo, full diſtance hereSunders the cradle from the beere.A fellow-traveller he hath binSo long with time, ſo worn to'th skin,That were it not juſt now bereftHis body firſt the ſoule had left.Threeſcore and ten is natures date,Our journey when we come in late:Beyond that time the overplusWas granted not to him, but us. For his own ſake the Sun ne're ſtood,But onely for the peoples good:Even ſo he was held out by aireWhich poor men uttered in their prayer:And as his goods were lent to give,So were his dayes that they might live.So ten years more to him were toldEnough to make another old:Oh that death would ſtill doe ſo,Or elſe on goodmen would beſtowThat waſt of years which unthrifts flingAway by their diſtempering.That ſome might thrive by this decayAs well as that of land and clay.Twas now well done: no cauſe to mourneOn ſuch a ſeaſonable ſtone;Where death is but a gueſt, we ſinneNot bidding welcome to his Inne.Sleep, ſleep, goodman, thy reſt embrace,Sleep, ſleep, th'aſt trod a weary race.
## Of Muſick.
WHen whiſpering ſtraines with creeping windDiſtill ſoft paſſion through the heart,And whilſt at every touch we findOur pulſes beat and bear a part.When threds can makeOur heart-ſtrings ſhake;Philoſophy can ſcarce denyOur ſoules conſiſts in harmony.When unto heavenly joyes we feigneWhat ere the ſoule affecteth moſt,Which onely thus we can explaineBy Muſick of the winged hoſt:Whoſe rayes we thinkMake ſtars to wink;Philoſophy can ſcarce denyOur ſoules conſiſt of harmony.O lul me, lul me, charming aire,My ſenſes each with wonder ſweet;Like ſnow on wool thy fallings are,Soft like ſpirits are thy feet. Griefe who needs fearThat hath an ear?Down let him lieAnd ſlumbring dye,And change his ſoule for harmony.
## To his Miſtreſſe.
ILe tell you how the Roſe did firſt grow red,And whence the Lillies whiteneſſe borrowed.You bluſht and ſtreight the Roſe with red was dight,The Lillies kiſſ'd your hands and ſo grew white.You have the native colour, theſe the die,And onely flouriſh in your livery:Before that time each Roſe was but one ſtaine,The lilly nought but paleneſſe did containe.
## On a black Gentlewoman.
IF ſhadowes be a Pictures excellenceAnd make it ſeem more glorious to the ſence:If ſtars in brighteſt day are loſt for ſightAnd ſeem more glorious in the mask of night. Why ſhould you think fair creature that you lackPerfection cauſe your eyes and haire are black.Or that your beauty, which ſo far exceedsThe new-ſprung Lillies in their maidenheads,The roſie colour of your cheeks and lipsShould by that darkneſſe ſuffer an ecclipſe.Rich Diamonds are fairer being ſetAnd compaſſed within a foileof jet.Nor can it be dame nature ſhould have madeSo bright a Sun to ſhine without a ſhade.It ſeems that nature when ſhe firſt did fancyYour rare compoſure ſtudied Negromancy:And when to you theſe guifts ſhe did impartShe uſed altogether the Black Art.She framed the Magick circle of your eyes,And made thoſe hairs the chains wherein ſhe tiesRebellious hearts, thoſe vaines, which doe appearTwined in Meanders about every ſphear,Myſterious figures are, and when you liſtYour voyce commandeth like an exorciſt.Now if in Magick you have skill ſo farVouchſafe to make me your familiar.Nor hath kind nature her black art revealdBy outward parts alone, ſome are conceald.As by the ſpring head men may eaſily knowThe nature of the ſtreams that run below.So your black eyes and haire doe give direction,That all the reſt are of the like complexion.The reſt where all reſt lies that bleſſeth man,That Indian mine, that ſtreight of Magellan. The worlds dividing gulph, through which who ventersWith hoiſed ſailes and raviſhd ſences entersTo a new world of bliſſe. Pardon I prayIf my rude muſe preſumes for to diſplaySecrets forbid, or hath her bounds ſurpaſtIn praiſing ſweetneſſe which ſhe nere did taſt:Starv'd men may talk of meat, and blind men may(Though hid from light) yet know there is a day.A rover in the mark his arrow ſticksSometimes as well as he that ſhoots at pricks.And if I might direct my ſhaft aright,The black mark would I hit, and not the white.
## On a Gentlewoman walking in the Snow.
I Saw faire Cloris walk alone,When feathered raine came ſoftly downe,And Jove deſcended from his TowerTo court her in a ſilver ſhowre:The wanton ſnow flew to her breaſtLike little birds into their neſt,And overcome with whiteneſſe thereFor griefe diſſolv'd into a teare, Which trickling down her garments hemmeTo deck her freezd into a gemme.
## Ʋpon one dead in the ſnow.
WIthin a fleece of ſilent waters drownd.Before I met with death a grave I found.That which eiled my life from her ſweet homeFor griefe ſtreight froze it ſelfe into a Tomb.Onely one Element my fate thought meetTo be my death, grave, tomb, and winding ſheet.Phoebus himſelfe my Epitaph had writ;But blotting many ere he thought one fit,He wrote untill my tomb and grave were gone;And 'twas an Epitaph that I had none;For every man that paſſ'd along that wayWithout a ſculpture read that there I lay.Here now the ſecond time incloſed I lyeAnd thus much have the beſt of deſtiny.Corruption (from which onely one was free)Devour'd my grave, but did not ſeize on me.My firſt grave took me from the race of men,My laſt ſhall give me back to life agen.
## On a woman dying in travell the child unborne.
WIthin this grave there is a grave intombd,Here lies a mother and a child inwombd.Twas ſtrange that nature ſo much vigour gaveTo one that nere was born, to make a grave.Yet an injunction ſtranger nature willd her,Poor mother, to be tomb to that which kild her:And not with ſo much cruelty content,Buries the child, the grave, and monument.Where ſhall we write the Epitaph? whereon?The child, the grave, the monument is gone:Or if upon the child we write a ſtaffe,Where ſhall we write the tombs own Epitaph?Onely this way is left, and now we muſtAs on a table carpeted with duſtMake chiſells of our fingers, and engraveAn Epitaph both on the tomb and graveWithin the duſt: but when ſome hours are goneWill not the Epitaph have need of one?I know it well: yet grave it therefore deepThat thoſe which know the loſſe may truly weep And ſhed their tears ſo juſtly in that placeWhich we before did with a finger trace,That filling up the letters they may lieAs inlaid Chriſtall to poſterity.Where (as in glaſſe) if any write anotherLet him ſay thus, here lies a hapleſſe motherWhom cruel ſate hath made to be a tomb,And kept in travell till the day of doom.
## On Man.
ILl buſied man why ſhouldſt thou take ſuch careTo lenghthen out thy lives ſhort callendar;Each dropping ſeaſon, and each flower doth cryFool as I fade and wither thou muſt die.The beating of thy pulſe when thou art wellIs but the towling of thy paſſing bell:Night is thy hearſe, whoſe ſable CanopyCovers alike deceaſed day and thee.And all thoſe weeping dewes which nightly fallAre but as tears ſhed for thy funerall.
## On Faireford windows.
TEll me you anti-Saints why glaſſeWith you is longer lived then braſſe:And why the Saints have ſcap'd their fallsBetter from windowes then from walls.Is it becauſe the brethrens firesMaintaine a glaſſe-houſe in Black-friers?Next which the Church ſtands North and South,And Eaſt and Weſt the Preachers mouth.Or iſt becauſe ſuch painted wareReſembles ſomething what you are,So pied, ſo ſeeming, ſo unſoundIn doctrine and in manners found,That ont of emblemattick witYou ſpare your ſelves in ſparing it?If it be ſo then Faireford boaſt,Thy Church hath kept what all have loſt;And is preſerved from the baneOf either war or Puritan.Whoſe life is colour'd in the paint,The inſide droſſe, the outſide Saint.
## On a Gentlewoman playing on the Lute.
BE ſilent you ſtill muſick of the ſphears,And every ſence make haſt to be all eares;And give devout attention to her aires,To which the Gods doe liſten as to prayersOf pious votaries: the which to hearTumult would be attentive, and would ſwearTo keep leſſe noiſe at Nile if there ſhe ſing,Or with a ſacred touch grace but one ſtring.Amongſt ſo many auditors, ſo many throngsOf Gods and men, that preſſe to hear her ſongs,Oh let me have an uneſpied room,And die with ſuch an anthem ore my tomb.
## On Love.
WHen I do love I would notwiſh to ſpeed,To plead fruition rather then deſire,But on ſweet lingring expectation feed,And gently would protract not feed my fire. What though my love a martyrdome you name,No Salamander ever feels the flame.That which is obvious I as much eſteemAs Courtiors doe old cloths: for noveltyDoth relliſh pleaſures, and in them we deemThe hope is ſweeter then the memory.Injoying breeds a glut, men better taſtComforts to come, then pleaſures that are paſt.
## The Catholick.

I Know no paint of PoetryCan mend ſuch colours ImageryIn ſullen inke; Yet Faireford IMay relliſh thy faire memory.Such is the ecchoes fainter found;Such is the light when Sun is drownd.So did the fancy look uponThe work before it was begun.Yet when thoſe ſhews are out of ſightMy weaker colours may delight.Thoſe Images ſo faithfullyReport the feature to the eye,As you would think each picture wasSome viſage in a looking-glaſſe;Not a glaſſe-window face, unleſſeSuch as Cheap-ſide hath, when a preſſeOf painted Gallants looking outBedeck the caſement round about.Bnt theſe have holy phiſnomy;Each pane inſtructs the laityWith ſilent eloquence, for hereDevotion leads the eye not eare To note the cetechiſing paint;Whoſe eaſie phraſe did ſo acquaintOur ſence with Goſpel that the CreedIn ſuch a hand the weak may read.Such types can yet of vertue be,And Chriſt as in a glaſſe we ſee.Behold two Turtles in one CageWith ſuch a lovely equipage,As they who mark them well may doubtSome young ones have been there ſtolne out.When with a fiſhing rod the ClarkSt. Peters draught of fiſh doth mark:Such is the ſcale, the eye, the fin,You'd think they ſtrove and leap'd within:But if the net which holds them brakeHe with his angle ſome would take.But would you walk a turne in Pauls,Look up, one little pane inroulesA fairer Temple, fling a ſtoneThe Church is out of the window flown.Conſider but not ask your eyes,And ghoſts at mid-day ſeem to riſe.The Saints their ſtriving to deſcendAre paſt the glaſſe and downward bend.Look there the Devils all would cry,Did they not ſee that Chriſt was by.See where he ſuffers for thee, ſeeHis body taken from the tree:Had ever death ſuch life before?The limber corps beſullied ore With meager paleneſſe doth diſplayA middle ſtate 'twixt fleſh and clay:His armes, his head, his legs, his crownLike a true Lambskin dangling down:Who can forbear the grave being nighTo bring freſh ointment in his eye?The Puritans were ſure deceiv'dWho thought thoſe ſhadows mov'd and heav'd.So held from ſtoning Chriſt; the windAnd boiſterous tempeſts were ſo kindAs on his Image not to pray,Whom both the winds and Sea obey.At Momus wiſh be not diſmaied;For if each Chriſtians heart were glaz'dWith ſuch a window, then each breaſtMight be his own Evangeliſt.
## On the praiſe of an ill-favourd Gentlewoman.
MArry and love thy Flavia, for ſheHath all things whereby others beautious be:For though her eyes be ſmall, her mouth is great,Though her lips Ivory be, her teeth be jet:Though they be dark, yet ſhe is light enough,And though her harſh hair fail, her skin is rough, And what if it be yellow, her haires red,Give her but thine ſhe has a maidenhead.Theſe things are beauties elements, where theſeCompounded are in one ſhe needs muſt pleaſe:If red and white and each good qualityBe in the wench, nere ask where it doth lye:In buying things perfumed we ask if thereBe musk and amber in it, but not where.Though all her parts be not ith' uſuall place,She hath the anagram of a good face.When by the gam-ut ſome Muſitians makeA perfect ſong, others will undertakeBy the ſame gam-ut chang'd to equall it:Things ſimply good can never be unfit.For one nights revells ſilk and gold we uſe,But in long journies cloth and leather chuſe.Beauty is barren oft; and husbands ſayThere's the beſt land where is the fouleſt way.And what a ſoveraigne medicine will ſhe beIf thy paſt ſins have taught thee jealouſie.Here needs no ſpies nor Eunuchs: her commitSafe to thy foes yea to thy Marmoſet.When Belgias Cities th' ruind country drownThat durty foulneſs armes and guards the Town.So doth her face guard her, and ſo for thee,Which by occaſion abſent oft mayeſt be.She whoſe face like the clouds turns day to night,And mightier then the Sea makes Moors ſeem white. Who though ſeven years ſhe in the ſtreet hath laidA Nunnery durſt receive and think a maid.And though in child-bed-labour ſhe did lieMidwives would ſwear 'twere but a tympany.If ſhe accuſe her ſelfe, i'le credit leſſeThen witches which impoſſibles confeſſe.

MY limbs were weary, and my head oppreſtWith drowſineſſe and yet I could not reſt.My bed was ſuch no down nor feathers canMake one more ſoft, though Jove again turn Swan.No fear diſtracted thoughts my ſlumber broke,I heard no ſcreech-owle ſqueak, nor raven croak;Nay even the flea (that proud inſulting elſe)Had taken truce, and was aſleep it ſelfe:But 'twas nights darling, and the woods chiefe jewelThe Nightingale that was ſo ſweetly crewel.And wooed my ears to rob my eyes of ſleep.That whilſt ſhe ſung of Tereus, they might weep,And yet rejoyce the tyrant did her wrong,Her cauſe of woe was burthen of her ſong;Which whilſt I liſtned too, and greiv'd to hear,Twas ſuch I could have wiſh'd my ſelfe all eare.Tis falſe the Poets feigne of Orpheus, heCould neither move a ſtone, a beaſt, nor treeTo follow him; but whereſoere ſhe fliesShe makes a grove, where Satyrs and FairiesAbout her perch to daunce her roundelayes,For ſhe ſings ditties to them whilſt Pan playes.

## A Parodox on the praiſe of a painted face.
NOt kiſs? by Jove I muſt and make impreſſionAs long as Cupid dares to hold his SeſſionUpon thy fleſh and blood, our kiſſes ſhallOut minute time, and without number fall.Doe not I know theſe balls of bluſhing redThat on thy cheeks thus amorouſly are ſpred;Thy ſnowy neck, thoſe veins upon thy browWhich with their azure crinkling ſweetly bow,Are from art borrowed, and no more thine ownThen chains that on St. Georges day are ſhownAre proper to the wearer? yet for thisI Idoll thee, and beg a courteous kiſſe. The Fucus and Ceruſſe which on thy faceThe cunning hand doth lay to add more grace,Deceive me with ſuch pleaſing fraud, that IFind in thy art wht can in nature lie:Much like a Painter which upon ſome wallOn which the cadent Sun-beams uſe to fall,Paints with ſuch art a guilded butterfly,That ſilly maids with ſlow-made fingers tryTo catch it, and then bluſh at their miſtake,Yet of this painted fly much reckoning make.Such is our ſtate, ſince what we look uponIs nought but colour and proportion:Give me a face that is as full of liesAs Gipſies or your cunning Lotteries;That is more falſe and more ſophiſticateThen are your reliques, or a man of ſtate:Yet ſuch being glazed by the ſlight of artGaine admiration, and win many a heart.Put caſe there be a difference in the mould,Yet may thy Venus be more brisk and bold.—for oftentimes we ſeeRich Candy wines in wooden bowles to be.The odoriferous Civet doth not lyeWithin the Muſcats noſe, or eare, or eye,But in a baſer place: for prudent natureIn drawing up the various forms and ſtature,Gives from the curious ſhop of her large treaſureTo faire parts comelineſſe, to baſer pleaſure.The faireſt flower that in the ſpring doth growIs not ſo much for uſe, as for a ſhow. As Lillies, Hyacinths, the gorgeous birthOf all pied flowers which diaper the earth,Pleaſe more with their diſcolourd purple traineThen wholeſom potherbs which for uſe remaine.Should I a golden ſpeckled Serpent kiſſeBecauſe the colour which he wears is his?A perphum'd cordovant who would not wear,Becauſe its ſent is borrowed other where?The cloths and veſtiments which grace us allAre not our own but adventitiall.Time rifles natures beauty, but ſly artRepaires by cunning each decaied part,Fills here a wrinkle, and there purles a veine;And with a cunning hand runs ore againeThe breaches dented by the pen of time,And makes deformity to be no crime▪So when great men are grip'd by ſickneſſe: hand,Illuſtrious phiſick pregnantly doth ſtandTo patch up foule diſeaſes, and doth ſtriveTo keep their tottering carkaſes alive.Beauty a candle is, with every puffeBlown out, leaves nothing but a ſtinking ſnuffeTo fill our noſtrils with: thus boldly thinkThe pureſt candle yields the fouleſt ſtink:As the pure food, and daintieſt nutriment,Yields the moſt ſtrong and hotteſt excrement.Why hang we then on things ſo apt to vary,So fleeting, brittle, and ſo temporary,That agues, coughs, the toothach, or cathar,Slight touches of diſeaſes ſpoil and mar. But when that age their beauty doth diſplace,And plows up furrows in their once ſmooth face;Then they become forſaken and do ſhowLike ſtately Abbies deſtroyed long ago.Love grant me then a reparable face,That whilſt there colours are can want no grace:Pygmalions painted ſtatue I could love,If it were warme, and ſoft, or could but move.

WHen Orpheus ſwetly did complainUpon his Lute with heavy ſtrainHow his Euridice was ſlain;The trees to hearObtain'd an eareAnd after left it off again.At every ſtroke and every ſtayThe boughs kept time and nodding lay,And liſtned bending every way;The aſhen treeAs well as well as heBegan to ſhake and learnt to play.If wood could ſpeak, a tree might hear,If wood can ſound our griefe ſo near,A tree might drop an amber tear:If wood ſo wellCould ſound a knell,The Cypreſſe might condoal the bear.The ſtanding nobles of the grove,Hearing dead wood to ſpeak and move,The fatall axe began to love;They envied deathThat gave ſuch breath,As men alive doe Saints above.

AM I once more bleſt with a grace ſo highAs to be lookt on with that other eye?Or ſhall I think it once more ſent againeTo iterate my ſouls ſweet laſting paine?Your other eye, dear ſoule, had fire beforeAnd darts enough, you need not have ſought moreFrom this revived; ſcarce could I endureThe luſtre of this eye when 'twas obſcure:How ſhall I now when like a freſh-born SunIt ſtrikes forth ſuch a new reflection?Yet welcome, deareſt torment, ſpare not meDart forth more flames, they pleaſe if ſent from thee I hope your eyes as they in luſtre doe,Will imitate the Sun in virtue too.If plagues and ſickneſſes from him be ſentYet gives he warmth, life, growth and nouriſhment.This is my comfort now, if one eye ſtrike,The other may give remedy alike.Welcome againe clear lamp of beauty; ſhine,Shine bright on Earth as do the ſoule divine,To which my thoughts with like devotion runAs Indians adore the riſing Sun.Now ſhall I mine own Image view aliveIn this extenuating perſpective,This living looking glaſſe, when thou ſhalt graceMe, ſweet, ſo much as to admit my faceNeighbour to thine, o how I then ſhall loveTo ſee my ſhape in that black ſtream to move:Againſt all reaſon I then more admireMy ſhadow there, then my whole ſelfe entire.How oft (though loth from that ſweet ſeat to part)Strive I to travell that way to thy heart;Where if one wink doe thy quick look recall,I looſe, poor wretch, my ſhadow, ſelfe, and all.Thus all the life which I ſo glorious thoughtBy thy ſole wink is quencht and turn'd to nought.Oh how I wont to curſe that cobweb lawnWhich like a curtaine ore thy eye was drawn,As if that death upon that eye did ſit,And this had bin the winding ſheet for it,The which, as it from off that eye was thrown,Seemd to look pale for griefe that it was gone. Yet when both this and t'other dainty robeDid cloſe like caſes that moſt heavenly globe,Think not they could diſparage your faire eyes;No more then painters doe their chiefeſt prize;Who uſe to hang ſome veil or ſilken ſheet,That men may more deſire and long to ſe'it.

THou that by ruine doeſt repaire,And by deſtruction art a Founder:Whoſe art doth tell us what men are,Who by corruption ſhall riſe ſounder:In this fierce fires intenſive heat,Remember this is Tom the great.And, Cyclops, think at every ſtroakWith which thy ſledge his ſide ſhall wound,That then ſome Statute thou haſt broakWhich long depended on his ſound;And that our Colledge-Gates doe cryThey were not ſhut ſince Tom did die.Think what a ſcourge 'tis to the CityTo drink and ſwear by Carfax Bell,Which bellowing without tune or pittyThe night and day devides not well;But the poor tradeſmen muſt give oreHis ale at eight or ſit till four.We all in haſt drink off our wine,As if we never ſhould drink more;So that the reckoning after nineIs larger now then that before.Releaſe this tongue which erſt could ſayHome Scollers; drawer whats to pay?So thou of order ſhalt be Founder,Making a Ruler for the people,One that ſhalt ring thy praiſes rounderThen t'other ſix bells in the ſteeple:Wherefore think when Tom is runningOur manners wait upon thy cunning.Then let him raiſed be from groundThe ſame in number, weight, and ſound;For may thy conſcience rule thy gaine,Or would thy theft might be thy baine.
## On a Gentleman, that kiſſing his Miſtreſſe left blood upon her.
WHat myſtery is this that I ſhould findMy blood in kiſſing you to ſtay behind?Twas not for want of colour that requiredMy blood for paint: no die could be deſiredOn that faire cheeck, where ſcarlet were a ſpot,And where the juice of Lillies but a blot:If at the preſence of the murthererThe wound will bleed, and tell the cauſe is there,A touch will doe much more: even ſo my heartWhen ſecretly it felt your killing dartShewed it in blood; which yet doth more complainBecauſe it cannot be ſo toucht again.This wounded heart to ſhew its love moſt trueSent forth a drop and wrote its mind on you;Was ever paper halfe ſo white as this,Or wax ſo yielding to the printed kiſſe?Or ſeal ſo ſtrong? no letter ere was writThat could the Authors mind ſo truly fit:For though my ſelfe to forraine countries flyMy blood deſires to keep you company; Here I could ſpill it all, thus I can freeMy enemy from blood though ſlaine I be:But ſlaine I cannot be, nor meet with ill,Since but to you I have no blood to ſpill.
## On an aged Gentlewoman.
NO ſpring nor ſummers beauty hath ſuch graceAs I have ſeen in one autumnall face.Young beauties force their loves, and thats a rape,Your's doth but counſell, yet they cannot ſcape:If 'twere a ſhame to love, here twere no ſhame,Affection takes here reverences name▪Were her firſt years the golden age? thats true;But now ſhe's gold oft tried and ever new:That was her torrid and inflaming time,This is her tolerable tropick clime.Faire eyes, who askes more heat then comes from thence,He in a feaver wiſhes peſtilence.Call not thoſe wrinkles graves, if graves they wereThey were loves graves, for elſ they are no where;Yet lies not love dead here, but here doth ſitVowed to this trench like to an Anchoret:And here till her (which muſt be his) death'sHe doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb:Here dwells he, though he ſojourne every where doomIn progreſſe, yet his ſtanding houſe is here. She allwayes evening is, nor noon nor night,Where's no voluptuouſnſſe, though a delight.Xerxes ſtrange love, the broad-leav'd plantane tree,Was loved for age, none being ſo large as ſheOr elſe becauſe being young, nature did bleſſeHer youth with ages glory barrenneſſe.If we love things long ſought, age is a thingWhich we are ſixty years a compaſſing:If tranſitory things which ſoon decay,Age muſt be lovelieſt at the lateſt day.But name not winter-faces, whoſe skin's ſlack,Lank like an unthrifts purſe, or empty ſack;Whoſe eyes ſeek light within, for all here's ſhade,Whoſe mouth's a hole rather worn out then made,Whoſe ſeverall tooth to a ſeverall place is goneTo vex their ſoules at the Reſurrection:Name not theſe living deaths-heads unto me,For ſuch not antient, but antiques be.I hate extreams; yet I had rather ſtayWith tombs then cradles to wear out the day:Since that loves naturall motion is▪ may ſtillMy love deſcend and journey down the hill;Not panting after growing beauties, ſoI ſhall ebb on with them that homewards go.
## On his Miſtreſſe going to Sea.
FArewell fair Saint, may not the Seas and windSwel like the heart and eyes you leave behind,But calme and gentle (like the looks they bear)Smile on your face and whiſper in your eare:Let no foule billow offer to ariſeThat it may nearer look upon your eyes,Leaſt wind and waves enamourd with ſuch formShould throng and croud themſelves into a ſtorm;But if it be your fate (vaſt Seas) to love,Of my becalmed heart learn how to move:Move then, but in a gentle lovers pace,No wrinkles nor no furrowes in your face;And ye fierce winds ſee that you tell your taleIn ſuch a breath as may but fill her ſaile:So whilſt you court her each his ſeverall wayYou will her ſafely to her port convay;And looſe her in a noble way of woing,Whilſt both contribute to your own undoing.

BLind fortune if thou wants a guide;Ile ſhew thee how thou ſhalt divide,Diſtribute unto each his due:Juſtice is blind and ſo are you.Toth' Uſerer this doom impart,May Scriveners break and then his heart;His debters all to beggery call,Or whats as bad turne Courtiers all.Unto the tradeſmen that ſell dearA long Vacation all the year,Revenge us too for their deceitsBy ſending wives light as their weights.But fortune how wilt recompenceThe Frenchmens daily inſolence? That they may know no greater paineMay they returne to France againe.To lovers, that will not believeTheir ſweet miſtakes, thy blindneſſe give.And leaſt the Players ſhould grow poorGive them Aglaura's more and more.To Phiſitians if thou pleaſeGive them another new diſeaſe.To Schollers give (if thou canſt doe't)A Benefice without a ſuit.To court Lords grant monopolies,And to their wives communities:So fortune thou ſhalt pleaſe them all,When Lords doe riſe and Ladies fall.Give to the Lawers I beſeechAs much for ſilence as for ſpeech.Give Ladies Uſhers ſtrength of back,And unto me a cup of Sack.

Your faireſt haireShadows the Picture of your face more faire:Your two black ſphears are like two Globes beſetWith Ebony, or ring'd about with Jet.O how I now deſire ene to departFrom all the reſt, and ſtudy the Black art:But ſince thats not alowed me, I will ſeeHow I may truely, faireſt, ſtudy thee.
## To the Memory of BEN: JOHNSON.
AS when the veſtall hearth went out, no fireLeſſe holy then the flame that did expireCould kindle it againe: ſo at thy fallOur wit great Ben, is too ApocriphallTo celebrate the loſſe; ſince tis too muchTo write thy Epitaph, and not be ſuch.What thou wert, like the hard Oracles of oldWithout an extaſie cannot be told.We muſt be raviſht firſt, thou muſt infuſeThy ſelfe into us both the theam and muſe.Elſe, though we all conſpir'd to make thy herſeOur work, ſo that it had been but one great verſe:Though the Prieſt had tranſlated for that timeThe Liturgy, and buried thee in rime;So that in meeter we had heard it ſaidPoetique duſt is to Poetique laid:And though that duſt being Shakeſpears, thou mighſt haveNot his room but the Poet for thy grave;So that as thou didſt Prince of numbers dyeAnd live, ſo now thou mighſt in numbers lye;Twere fraile ſolemnity. Verſes on theeAnd not like thine, would but kind libels be;And we, not ſpeaking thy whole worth, ſhould raiſeWorſe blots then they that envied thy praiſe▪ Indeed thou needſt not us, ſince above allInvention, thou wert thine own funerall.Hereafter when time hath fed on thy Tomb,The inſcription worne out, and the marble dumb;So that 'twould poſe a Crittick to reſtoreHalfe words, and words expir'd ſo long before.When thy maim'd ſtatue hath a ſentencd face,And looks that are the horrour of the place;That twill be learning and antiquityTo ask a Selden to ſay this was thee;Thou'lt have a whole name ſtill: nor needſt thou fearThat will be ruind, or looſe noſe or hair.Let others write ſo thin, that they can't beAuthors till rotten, no poſterityCan add to thy works, th' had their whole growth thenWhen firſt borne, and came aged from the pen.Whilſt living thou enjoyeſt the fame and ſence,And all that time gives but the reverence.When tha'rt of Homers years, no man will ſayThy Poems are leſſe worthy, but more gray.Tis baſtard Poetry, and of the falſe bloodWhich can't withot ſucceſſion be good.Things that will always laſt, doe thus agreeWith things Eternall, they at once perfect be.Scorne then their cenſure, who gave out thy witAs long about a Comedy did ſit,As Elephants bring forth; and that thy blotsAnd mendings took moretime then Fortune plots:That ſuch thy drought was, and ſo great thy thirſt,That all thy Plays were drawn at the Mermaid firſt. That the Kings yearly Butt wrote, and his wineHad more right then thou to thy Cateline.Let ſuch men keep a diet, let their witBe rackt, and while they write, ſuffer a fitWhen they have felt tortures which outpaine the gouut,Such as with leſſe the State draws Treaſon out;Though they ſhould the length of conſumption lie,Sick of their Verſe, and of their Poem die,Twould not be thy worſt Scene, but would at laſtConfirme their boaſtings, and ſhew't made in haſt.He that writes well, writes quick, ſince the rules true,Nothing is ſlowly done, thats always new.So when thy Fox had ten times Acted been,Each day was firſt, but that twas cheaper ſeen.And ſo thy Alchymiſt Played ore and ore,Was new oth' ſtage, when twas not at the door.We, like the Actors, did repeat, the pitThe firſt time ſaw, the next conceived thy wit:Which was caſt in thoſe forms, ſuch rules, ſuch arts,That but to ſome not halfe thy Acts were parts:Since of ſome ſilken judgements we may ſayThey fild a box two houres, but ſaw no Play.So that the unlearned loſt their mony, andSchollers ſaved onely, that could underſtand.Thy Scene was free from monſters, no hard plotCalld down a God t' untie the unlikely knot.The ſtage was ſtill a ſtage, two entrancesWere not two parts of the world disjoynd by Seas.Thine were land Tragedies, no Prince was foundTo ſwim a whole Scene out, then oth'ſtage drownd, Pitcht fields▪ and Red-Bul wars, ſtill felt thy doom,Thou laidſt no ſieges to the Muſick Room;Nor wouldſt alow to thy beſt ComediesHumors that ſhould above the people riſe:Yet was thy language and thy ſtile ſo highThy Sock to the ancle, Buskin reachd toth' thigh:And both ſo chaſt, ſo 'bove dramatick clean,That we both ſafely ſaw and lived thy Scene.No foul looſe line did proſtitute thy wit,Thou wrotſt thy Comedies; didſt not commit.We did the vice arraignd not tempting hear,And were made judges not bad parts by the eare.For thou even ſin didſt in ſuch words array,That ſome who came bad parts, went out good Play.Which ended not with th' Epilogue, the ageStill Acted▪ and grew innocent from the ſtage.Tis true thou hadſt ſome ſharpneſſe, but thy ſaltServ'd but with pleaſure to reforme the fault:Men were laught into vertue, and none moreHated Face acted then were ſuch before.So did thy ſting not blood but humors draw;So much doth Satyre more correct then Law;Which was not nature in thee, as ſome callThy teeth, who ſay thy wit lay in thy gall.That thou diſt quarrel firſt, and then in ſpightDidſt 'gainſt a perſon of ſuch vices write:And twas revenge not truth, that on the ſtageCarlo was not preſented, but thy rage:And that when thou in company wert met,Thy meat took notes, and thy diſcourſe was net. We know thy free vaine had this innocence,To ſpare the party, and to brand the offence.And the juſt indignation thou wert inDid not expoſe Shift but his tricks and gin.Thou mighſt have us'd th'old comick freedome, theſeMight have ſeen themſelves played like Socrates.Like Cleon Mammon might the Knight have been;If as Greek Authors thou hadſt turn'd Greek ſpleen;And hadſt not choſen rather to tranſlateTheir learning into Engliſh, not their hate.Indeed this laſt, if thou hadſt been bereftOf thy humanity, might be called theft.The other was not, whatſoere was ſtrangeOr borrowed in thee did grow thine by th' change.Who without Latine helps, hadſt been as rareAs Beaument, Fletcher, or as Shakeſpeare were:And like them from thy native ſtock couldſt ſayPoets and Kings are not born every day.
## An Anſwer to the Letter of the Cloake.
Mr. Roberts,I Wonder that you ſhould ſend for the Cloak,I thought you ſcornd it ſhould be ſpokeThat once your promiſe ſhould be broke,If from your word you doe revokeI have wit enough to keep the Cloak.You ſay youle make me ſmart for the Cloak,I doe not care a fart for the Cloak,Yet I will ſtudy the black art in the CloakRather then I will part with the Cloak.You ſay you mean to try for the Cloak,I ſcorne to tell a lye for the Cloak,My word Ile never deny for the CloakAlthough I thought youd cry for the Cloak.I doe proteſt moſt deep in the CloakI did both mourne and weep in the Cloak,And if I ſhould not keep the CloakI were a very ſheep in the Cloak.I took your Cloak to mourne in your Cloak,My corps I did adorne in your Cloak,And many a time have I ſworn in your CloakThat I will never return in your Cloak.Your father we did bury in the Cloak,And after we were merry in the Cloak,And then I told Mr. Perry of the Cloak,And yet I am not weary of the Cloak.Yet ſtill I ſtand in fear of the CloakThat I ſhall be never the near for the Cloak:I pray you, good Sir, forbear the CloakI know that you can ſpare the Cloak.It coſt me many a tear in your Cloak,And many a beaker of bear in your Cloak;And yet I ſtand in fear of your CloakThat I ſhall be nere the near for your Cloak.Therefore, good Sir, forbear the Cloak,For though I have worn bare the Cloak,I had rather for to tear the CloakThen ſee another wear the Cloak.Your friend in truth till death me choakIf you will let me have the Cloak.

MUſt then our loves be ſhort ſtill? muſt we chuſeNot to enjoy? only admire & looſe?Muſt axiomes hence grow ſadly underſtood,And we thus ſee tis dangerous to be good?So books begun are broken off, and weReceive a fragment for an Hiſtory;And as 'twere preſent wealth, what was but debt,Loſe that of which we are not owners yet; But as in books that want the cloſing line,We onely can conjecture, and repine▪So muſt we here too onely grieve, and gueſſe,And by our fancy make, whats wanting, leſſe.Thus when rich webs are left unfiniſhed,The ſpider doth ſupply them with her thred.For tell me what addition can be wroughtTo him, whoſe youth was even the bound of thought.Whoſe buddings did deſerve the robe, whiles weIn ſmoothneſſe did the deeds of wrinkles ſee:When his State-nonage might have been thought fit.To break the cuſtome and allowed to ſit.His actions veiled his age, and could not ſtayFor that we call ripeneſſe, and juſt day.Others may wait the ſtaffe and the gray haire,And call that wiſdome which is onely fear.Chriſten a coldneſſe temperance, and then boaſtFull and ripe vertue, when all actions loſt:This is not to be noble, but be ſlack;A Stafford ne're was good by the Almanack.He, who thus ſtayes the ſeaſon, and expects,Doth not gaine habits, but diſguiſe defects.Here nature outſlips culture: he came tried,Straight of himſelfe at firſt, not rectified:Manners ſo pleaſing and ſo handſome caſt,That ſtill that overcame which was ſhewn laſt.All minds were captived thence, as if't had beenThe ſame to him to have been loved and ſeen. Had he not been ſnatch'd thus, what drive hearts nowInto his nets, would have driven Cities too:For theſe his eſſayes which began to winWere but bright ſparks which ſhewed the mine within.Rude draughts unto the Picture; things we mayStile the firſt beams of the increaſing day;Which did but onely great diſcoveries bring,As outward cooleneſſe ſhews the inward ſpring.Nor were his actions to content the ſight,Like Artiſts pieces plac'd in a good light,That they might take at diſtance, and obtrudeSomething unto the eye that might delude:His deeds did all moſt perfect then appearWhen you obſerv'd, view'd cloſe, and did ſtand nearFor could there ought elſe ſpring from him whoſe lineFrom which he ſprung was rule and diſcipline.Whoſe vertues were as books before him ſet,So that they did inſtruct, who did beget:Taught thence not to be powerfull, but know,Shewing he was their blood by living ſo.For whereas ſome are by their big-lip known,Others by imprinted burning ſwords were ſhown;So they by great deeds are, from which bright fameEngraves free reputation on their name:Theſe are their native marks, and it hath beenThe Staffords lot to have their ſignes within. And though this firme hereditatry goodMight boaſted be as flowing with the blood,Yet he ne're graſpt this ſtay: but as thoſe, whoCarry perfumes about them ſtill, ſcarce doeThemſelves perceive them, though anothers ſenceSuck in the exhaling odour: ſo he thenceNe're did perceive he carried this good ſmell,But made new ſtill by doing himſelfe well.To imbalme him then is vaine, where ſpreading fameSupplies the want of ſpices; where the name,It ſelfe preſerving, may for ointment paſſe,And he ſtill ſeen lie coffind as in glaſſe.Whiles thus his bud dims full flowers, and his ſoleBeginning doth reproach anothers whole.Coming ſo perfect up, that there muſt needsHave been found out new titles for new deeds.Though youth and lawes forbid, which will not letStatues be rais'd, or him ſtand braſen: yetOur minds retaines this royalty of Kings,Not to be bound to time, but judge of thingsAnd worſhip as they merit: there we doePlace him at height, and he ſtands golden too.A comfort, but not equall to the croſſe,A faire remainder, but not like the loſſe.For he (that laſt pledge) being gone, we doeNot onely looſe the heir but the honour too.Set we up then this boaſt againſt our wrong,He left no other ſigne that he was young: And ſpight of fate his living vertues will,Though he be dead, keep up the Barony ſtill.

COuld we judge here moſt vertuous Madam: thenYour needle might receive praiſe from our pen.But this our want bereaves it of that part,Whilſt to admire and thank is all our Art▪The work deſerves a Shrine: I ſhould rehearſeIts glory in a ſtory, not a verſe.Colours are mix'd ſo ſubtily, that therebyThe ſtrength of art doth take and cheat the eye:At once a thouſand we can gaze upon,But are deceiv'd by their tranſition.What toucheth is the ſame; beam takes from beamThe next ſtill like, yet differing in the extream.Here runs this tract, thither we ſee that tends,But cannot ſay here this or there that ends▪Thus while they creep inſenſibly we doubtWhether the one pours not the other out. Faces ſo quick and lively, that we mayFear if we turn our backs theyl ſteal away.Poſtures of griefe ſo true, that we may ſwearYour artfull fingers have wrought paſſion there.View we the manger, and the Babe, we thenceBelieve the very threads have innocence.Then on the Croſſe, ſuch love, ſuch griefe we findAs twere a tranſcript of our Saviours mind:Each parcell ſo expreſſive, each ſo fit,That the whole ſeems not ſo much wrought as writ.Tis ſacred text, all we may coat, and thenceExtract what may be preſſ'd in our defence.Bleſt Mother of the Church, be in the liſtReckond with th' four a ſhe Evangeliſt;Nor can the ſtile be prophanation, whenThe needle may convert more then the pen.When faith may come by ſeeing; and each leafeRightly perus'd, prove Goſpell to the deafe.Had not that Hellen haply found the croſſeBy this your work, you had repaired that loſſe.Tell me not of Penelope, we doSee a web here more chaſt and ſacred too.Where are ye now O women, ye that ſowTemptations labouring to expreſſe the bowOf the blind Archer: ye that rarely ſetTo pleaſe your loves a Venus in a net?Turne your skill hither, then we ſhall no doubtSee the Kings daughter glorious too without.Women ſewed onely figleaves hitherto,Eves nakedneſſe is onely cloath'd by you.
## On the ſame.
MAdam, your work's all miracle, and youThe firſt Evangeliſt, whoſe skillfull clueHath made a road to Bethlem; now we mayWithout a ſtars direction find the wayTo the cratch our Saviours cradle, there him ſeeMantled in hay, had not your pietySwath'd him in ſilk; they that have skill may ſee(For ſure tis prickt) the Virgins lullaby.The Oxe would faine be bellowing did he not fearThat at his noyſe the Babe would wake and hear.And as each paſſage of his birth's at ſtrifeTo excell, ſo even the death's drawn to the life.See how the greedy ſouldiers tug to ſhareHis ſeameleſſe coat, as if your work they'd tear:Look on his read, thats naturall, on his gownThats a pure ſcarlet; ſo acutes his crown,That he who thinks not they are thorns indeed,Would he were prick'd untill his fingers bleed.His Croſſe a skilfull joyner cannot know,(So neat tis fram'd) where it be wood or no:So cloſely by the curious needle pointed,Had Joſeph ſeen't he knew not where were joynted.His ſide ſeems yet to bleed and leave a ſtain,As if the blood now trickled from the vein:Methinks I hear the Thiefe for mercy call,He might have ſtole't, 'twas nere lock'd up at all. See how he faints; the crimſon ſilk turns paleChanging its graine. Could I but ſee the vaileRent, all were finiſh'd, but thats well forborn;Twere pitty ſuch a work as this wee torn.Turn but your eye aſide and you may ſeeHis penſive handmaids take him from the tree,Embalming him with tears, none could expreſſe,Madam, but you death in ſo fit a dreſſe;No hand but yours could teach the needles eyeTo drop true tears, unfeignedly to cry.Follow him to his virgin tomb, and viewHis corps inviron'd with a miſcreate crueOf drowſie watch, who look as though they wereNere bid to watch and pray, but ſleep and ſwear:The third day being come, and their Charge gone,Only ſome Relicks left upon the ſtone;One quakes, another yawnes, a third in haſtTo run had not your needle made him faſt:And to excuſe themſelves all they can ſayIs that they dream'd ſome one ſtole him away:You, Madam, by the Angels guidance haveFound him againe ſince he roſe from the grave.So zealous of his company, no forceCould part you had not heaven made the divorſe;Where he remains till the laſt day, and thenI wiſh with joy you there may meet again.

Lady,YOu have drawn, and are all graces; none ſo trueAs thoſe lodge in your needle-work and you:Hither will throng we know theſe draughts to ſeeWhole bevies of Court Maddams; ſuch as beFair ſpectacles themſelves, yet ſhall theſe glaſſesRaviſh by ſhewing not theirs but your faces:Eyes that will ſhame the Chriſtalls, and out ſtealThe patterns quainteſt luſtre thoſe conceal:Fingers of Ivory that will pointing ſtandAs Indexes to ſhew where moved the hand,And in what method; till a dawning lightSpread on the Pictures from their neighbouring white;Yet ſo they ſhall not weave new beauties inThoſe webs, your ſilk is whiter then their skin:Tis ſaid that ſome will chang their own for boughtLocks, ſo they be not painted but thus wrought:And ſcanning well theſe treſſes well died threadsCurle into locks about the female heads,So neatly periwig'd, will chooſe to wearRather what you ſo make then what grows hair.This Lady learns a ſmile from hence, ſhe thereA devout griefe takes forth from Maryes tear,So lively dropt; as if ith' woman 'twasWater, what's ſilk ith' needle, pearl ith' glaſſe. A third will imitate your ſelfe, and tryEach pieces counterfeit: which being ſet byAs types unto your Goſpel, all will gueſſeYou are the Evangeliſt, ſhe the Propheteſſe.Here lies my Saviour; and though he it isLends life to all, yet borrows he from this:And doth to th' world by two Nativities comeBoth from your fancy and from Maryes womb▪For who obſerves the Art will move a ſtrifeWhether the threads be more of ſilk then life.All things are in ſuch proper colours ſhown;The naturall ſeem feigned, theſe their own:And all ſo well compoſ'd, their juncture ſuch,It were ſome ſeperation but to touch:As in the varied bow which Heaven▪ bendsThe red appears and yet the blew nere ends;Here green, and yellow there, yet none can ſeeWhere green or yellow do begin to be,Each into others tranſient, and ſo fitStill, what you chooſe nothing would ſerve but it.What punctuall thorns here crown the Crucifix;I thought your needle, but your ſilk more pricks.The ſides wound had appeared by a cleftIth' wound; had you but ſo much unwrought leftAnd open; as through which the ſpear once ſtole,Now you have fill'd it 'tis a truer hole.Did you pin down the hands and feet twould failMuch of the truth, the ſtich is verier naile:Well drops the blood in ſhadow; were there needOf true, but ſqueeze the Picture and 'twould bleed: For life that onely floats in vainer breathOther arts give: that which returns from death:Yours freſh and fully ideates; and is oneThat holds out to a Reſurrection.Here tis that it to Chriſt joyntly procuresA riſing from both bottomes, hell and yours:His countenance refin'd ſeems not more newIſſuing out from the grave then from your clew;Allmoſt ſo much of the Diety is ſhownIn your works as is viſible in its own:In theſe materialls we may more God ſeeThen heathens in a flower, or a true tree.But could we reach your fancy and find in'tThe ſpirituality of every Print;We darkly might conceive pure Godheads, oneNature, our Chriſt both of his fleſh and bone.Bleſt Soule, who thus internally haſt eyedThy Saviour; how haſt thou been ſanctified?I dare to ſay ſo long as he ſtayed inYour minds, pure mirrour, that you ſcarce did ſin:Had but one idle thought diſturb'd the glaſſe,That ſame reflected blemiſh would forth paſſeInto the ſtained table, and no doubtThe blur within had been a blot without.Look ore the Paſſion; now you only viewOld wonnds; had you then ſinn'd you had made new.But all is acurate: we cannot findOne fault in the copy, cauſe not one ith' mind:And yet tis drawn in ſuch briefe ImagryThe ſmalleſt error cannot unſeen lye. Each Picture's couched in ſo little ſpace,Had you but miſs'd a thread y'had loſt a face.Not as in gouty Arras, where a liſtOf any colour if left out's not miſt,And where the ſhuttle twenty times miſhotMakes not ſo rude a ſphalm, as here a knotOr ſtich let faln: tis eaſie to excellWbere's ſuch a latitude of doing well.But, Madam, you that in two Tables drawThe Goſpell whole, as God wrought all the Law,Are both compendious and true: the ſtoryDoth ſomething looſe in bulk, nothing in glory.The Magi are made leſſe, but not leſſe wiſe,Their gifts diminiſh, but their values riſe:For ſince they are come hither, thats thought beſtWhich they do bring from you, not from the Eaſt.We cannot pen forth all your Art, much leſſeOur Obligations and our thanks expreſſe:More will be ſaid when we can better prizeYour Preſent: mean while (Lady) let this ſuffice.With ſuch delight we your Imbrodry view,No other object can pleaſe more but you;Whoſe gift hath ſwoln us to ſuch thankfull prideW'have now no matter for a wiſh beſideThe giver; you alone outvy it, andWee'l wave the work onely to kiſſe your hand.
## Againſt BEN: JOHNSON.
 
*1.COme leave that ſaucy wayOf baiting thoſe that payDear for the ſight of thy declining wit:I know it is not fitThat a ſale-Poet (juſt contempt once thrown)Should cry up thus his own.I wonder by what dower,Or patent you had powerFrom all to rape a judgement? let it ſuſſiceHad you bin modeſt, y'had bin counted wiſe. 
*2.Tis known you can doe well,And that you can excellAs a tranſlator; but when things requireA genius and a fireNot kindled heretofore by others pains,As oft you have wanted brainsAnd art to ſtrike the white,As you have leveld right:But if men vouch not things Apocriphall,You bellow, rave, and ſpatter round your gall. 
*3.Jugge, Peg, Pierce, Fly, and allYour jeſts ſo nominall,Are things ſo far below an able braine,As they doe throw a ſtaineThrough all the unlucky plot, and doe diſpleaſeAs deep as Pericles:Where yet there is not laidBefore a chamber-maidDiſcourſe ſo weak, as might have ſerv'd of oldFor Schoolboys when they of love or valor told. 
*4.Why rage then when the ſhowShould judgement be; and knowThat there are thoſe in Pluſh that ſcorn to drudgFor Stages, yet can judgeNot onely Poets looſer laws but wits,With all their perquiſits:A gift as rich and highAs noble Poeſy,Which though in ſport it be for Kings a play,Tis next Mechanick when it works for pay. 
*6.Alcaeus Lute had none,Nor looſe Anacreon,That taught ſo bold aſſuming of the baiesWhen they deſerv'd no praiſe. To raile men into approbationTis new; tis yours alone;And proſpers not. For knowFame is as coy, as you;Can be diſdainfull; and who dares to proveA rape on her ſhall gaine her ſcorne not love. 
*6.Leave then this humerous vaine,And this more humerous ſtraine,Where ſelfe conceit and choler of the bloodEclips what elſe is good:Then if you pleaſe thoſe raptures high to touchWhereof you boaſt ſo much,And but forbear the crownTill the world put it on:No doubt from all you may amazement draw,Since braver theam no Phoebus ever ſaw.
## Ʋpon a Gentlewoman who broke her vow.
WHen firſt the Magick of thine eyeUſurp'd upon my liberty,Triumphing in my hearts ſpoile, thouDidſt lock up thine in ſuch a vow:When I prove falſe may the bright dayBe governd by the Moons pale ray:And I too well remember, thisThou ſaidſt and ſealdſt it with a kiſſe.O heavens! and could ſo ſoon that tieRelent in ſlack Apoſtaſie?Could all thy oaths and morgag'd truſtVaniſh like letters formd in duſt,Which the next wind ſcatters? take heed,Take heed, Revolter, know this deedHath wrongd the world; which will fare worſeBy thy example then thy curſe.Hide that falſe brow in miſts thy ſhame;Nere ſee light more, but the dim flameOf funerall lamps: thus ſit and moaneAnd learn to keep thy guilt at home;Give it no vent. For if againThy love or vowes betray more men; At length I fear thy perjur'd breathWill blow out day and waken death.
## A Song upon a Winepot.
ALl Poets Hippocrene admire,And pray to water to inſpireTheir wit and muſe with heavenly fire.Had they this heavenly fountaine ſeen,Sack both their muſe and wit had been,And this Pintepot their Hipocrene.Had they truly diſcovered it,They had like me, thought it unfitTo pray to water for their wit:And had ador'd Sack as divine,And made a Poet God of Wine,And this Pintepot had bin the Shrine.Sack unto them had bin inſteadOf Nectar and the heavenly bread,And every a boy a Gannemed:But had they made a God of it,Or ſtiled it Patron of their wit,This Pintepot had bin a Temple fit. Well then companions iſt not fit,Since to this gem we owe our wit,That we ſhould praiſe the Cabinet;And drink a health to this divineAnd bounteous palace of our Wine?Die he with thirſt that doth repine.

## A Song.
I Mean to ſing of Englands fate,(God bleſſe in th' mean time the King and his (Mate)Thats rul'd by the Antipodian ſtate,Which no body can deny.Had theſe ſeditious times been whenWe had the life of our wiſe Poet Ben,Apprentices had not been Parliament men,Which no body can deny.But Puritans bear all the ſway;And they'l have no Biſhops as moſt of them ſay,But God may have the better another day,Which no body can deny.Prin and Burton ſay women that are lewd and looſeShall wear Italian locks for their abuſe,They'l onely have private keys for their own uſe,Which no body can deny.Zealous Prin hath threatned a ſhrewd downfallTo cut off long locks both buſhy and ſmall,But I hope he will not take eares and all,Which no body can deny.They'l not alow of what pride in brings,No favours in hats nor any ſuch things,They'l convert all ribbands into Bible ſtrings,Which no body can deny.God bleſſe the King, and Queen alſo,And all true Subjects from high to low,The Roundheads can pray for themſelves we know,Which no body can deny.
## Ʋpon the Times.
THe Parliament cries arme, the King ſays no;The new Lievtenants cry on, lets go;The People all amaz'd, ask where's the foe?The bugbear Scots behind the door cry boh.Patience a while, and time will plainly ſhewThe King ſtands ſtill faſter then they can goe.

SAw you the Cloak at Church to dayThe long-worne ſhort Cloak lined with Say?What had the Man no Gown to wear,Or was this ſent him from the Mayor?Or iſt the Cloak which Nixon broughtTo trim the Tub where Golledge taught?Or can this beſt conceal his lips,And ſhew Communion ſitting hips?Or was the Cloak St. Pauls? if ſoWith it he found the Parchments too.Yes verily; for he hath beenWith mine Hoſt Gajus at the New-Inn.A Gown (God bleſſe us) trailes oth' flooreLike th' petticoat of the Scarlet Whore;Whoſe large ſtiffe pleats he dares confideAre ribs from Antichriſts own ſide.A mourning Cope, if't looks to the Eaſt,Is the black Surpliſſe of the Beaſt.Stay, read the Cards; the Queens and KingsThe beſt ith' Pack are Gouned things;But ſhortcut Spade with t'other threeAre dub'd ith Cloak of knavery.Beſide his Lordſhip cloak'd did ſtandWhen his Watch went falſe by ſlight of hand:Then look for more ſuch Cloaks as theſeFrom th' Court of Wards and Liveries.
