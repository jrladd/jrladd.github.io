A fun look at [English pop songs written by native Swedish-speakers](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/08/15/pop-songs-in-english-written-by-native-speakers-of-swedish/). I was already thinking about ABBAâ€™s delightful, sometimes nonsensical lyrics while watching the Mamma Mia! sequel. Even if I don&#39;t agree with every word of the piece (people can *definitely* be multilingual).
