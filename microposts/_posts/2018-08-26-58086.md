Nick Montfortâ€™s [A Web Reply to the Post-Web Generation](https://nickm.com/post/2018/08/a-web-reply-to-the-post-web-generation/) has me thinking about the place of networks like Microblog in the still uncertain future of computer-assisted art. Is the Web era really over, as he suggests? If so can it be revived?
