<h1>About J.R. Ladd</h1>

<p>I'm John Ladd, a doctoral candidate in English literature at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm currently writing a dissertation on collaboration in 17th-century poetry and print. My other academic interests include the history of the book, network analysis, and digital humanities.</p>
<p>I live in St. Louis with my partner, Katie, and our cat, Cardigan. In my spare time I use Python to <a href='/projects'>do things with words</a> and a crochet hook to do things with yarn.</p>

<p>During calendar year 2017, I was postdoctoral research fellow for [*Six Degrees of Francis Bacon*](http://sixdegreesoffrancisbacon.com), an early modern network analysis project at Carnegie Mellon University, where I managed data, oversaw the project's preservation, and coordinated the site's major redesign.</p>
