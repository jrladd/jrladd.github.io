# Basic Parts

## Networks are made up of...

- Entities (entity = node/vertex/actor)
- Relationships (relationship = edge/link/tie)
- We'll use "nodes" and "edges"

## Nodes and Edges have Attributes

### Node Attributes

- numerical (size)
- categorical (color)

### Edge Attributes

#### Directed and Undirected Edges

#### Weighted and Unweighted Edges

#### Edge Types


# Multiple Edges "in a row" Make a Path

## Path

## Diameter

## Average Shortest Path Length

# Some special kinds of nodes

## Isolates

## Hubs

## Bridges

# Measuring a node's "importance" with centrality

## Degree

## Strength

## Betweenness

# Different kinds of entities or nodes

## Unipartite/unimodal

## Bipartite/bimodal

## Multipartite/k-partite/multimodal

# Groups of nodes within a network

## Connected components

## Clusters and clustering

## Communities and community detection

## Density

# There are many ways to visualize a network

## Adjacency Matrix

## Adjacency List

## Node-Link Diagram

# Other Important Concepts

## Small World Network

## Triadic Closure

## Assortative mixing/Homophily

## Preferential Attachment

## Weak Ties
