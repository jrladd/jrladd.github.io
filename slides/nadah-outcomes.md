## How to Think About Outcomes

- Make it manageable for six-ish months
	- Small-to-medium size product
	- A proposal/plan for something larger
	- ~one month of sustained work (July)
- Single project or individual outcomes from group members
- Keep in mind institutional expectations
- What to do?
	- Use the following categories as a guide
	- Choose one or make a combination of any of these
	- Something else entirely

# Visualization

## Viz Possibilities

- Could be on its own, or incorporated into any of the above options
- Static or interactive or both
- Shareable in a single image or lives with a full explanation on a website/platform
- Depends on audience/purpose: specific takeaway, exploration, collaboration

## Node-link diagrams
- force-directed layouts
- arc diagrams
- chord diagrams
- circular layouts

## Adjacency matrix/grid/table layouts

- See [Chris Sula's presentation](http://bit.ly/sulanetworkdesign) for more examples

# Tools

## Common Goals with Tools
- Making your methods extensible/shareable
- Usable for other datasets/research questions
- Classroom/pedagogical use
- Designing for specific disciplines

## Website/javascript application
- [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)
- [Network Navigator](https://jrladd.com/network_navigator/)

## Software library/package
- Matt Lincoln's [ProjectoR](https://github.com/mdlincoln/projectoR)
- [Palladio embeddable components](https://github.com/humanitiesplusdesign/palladio-graph-component)

## Ways That I Can Help
