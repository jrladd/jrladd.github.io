ALl Gentlemen and Yoemen good,

down a down down,

I wiſh you to draw near,

for a ſtory of gallant bold Robin Hood

Vnto you I will declare.

down a down down.

As Robin Hood walkt the Forreſt along,

down a, &c.

Some paſtime for to ſpy,

there was he aware of a jolly ſhepherd

That on the ground did lye:

down a, &c.

Ariſe, ariſe, ſaid jolly Robin,

down a, &c.

And now come let me ſee,

what is in thy bag and bottle I ſay,

Come tell it unto me:

down a, &c.

What's that to thee, thou proud fellow,

down a, &c.

Tell me as I do ſtand,

what thou haſt to do with my bag and bot­tle,

Let me ſee thy command:

down a, &c.

My Sword that hangeth by my ſide,

down a, &c.

Is my command I know,

come and let me taſte thy Bottle,

Or it may breed thy woe:

down a,

The Devil a drop thou proud fellow,

down a, &c.

Of my bottle thou ſhalt ſee,

until thy valour here be try'd,

Whether thou wilt ſight or flee:

down a, &c.

What ſhall we fight for, cries Robin Hood

down a, &c.

Come tell it ſoon to me,

here's twenty pound in good red gold.

Win it and take it thee:

down a, &c.

### 1.1. The Second Part

to the ſame Tune.

THE Shepherd ſtood all in a maze

down a, &c.

And knew not what to ſay,

I have no money thou proud fellow,

But bag and bottle i'le lay:

down a, &c.

I am content thou Shepherd Swain,

down a, &c.

Fling them down on the ground,

but it will breed thee mickle pain

To win my twenty pound:

down a, &c.

Come draw thy ſword thou proud fellow,

down a, &c.

Thou ſtandeſt too long to prate,

this Hook of mine ſhall let thee know

A Coward I do hate:

down a, &c.

So they fell to it full hardy and ſore,

down a, &c.

It was on a Summers day,

from ten till four in the Afternoon,

The ſhepherd held him play,

down a, &c.

Robin's Buckler prov'd his chiefeſt defence,

down a, &c.

And ſaved him many a bang,

for every blow the ſhepherd gave.

Made Robin's ſword cry twang:

down a, &c.

Many a ſturdy blow the the ſhepherd gave,

down a, &c.

And that bold Robin found,

till the blood ran trickling from his head,

Then he fell to the ground:

down a, &c.

Ariſe, ariſe thou proud fellow,

down a, &c.

And thou ſhalt have fair play,

it th [...] wilt yield before thou go

That  [...] have won the day;

down a, &c.

A boon boon, cry'd bold Robin,

down a, &c.

If that a man thou be,

then let me take my beagle-horn,

And blow but blaſts three:

down a, &c.

Then ſaid the ſhepherd to bold Robin,

down a, &c.

To that I will agree:

for if thou ſhould blow till to morrow morn

I ſcorn one foot to flee:

down a, &c.

Then Robin he ſet his Horn to his mouth,

down a, &c.

And he blew with might and main,

until he eſpy'd little John

Come tripping over the Plain;

down a, &c.

O who is yonder thou proud fellow

down a, &c.

That comes down yonder hill?

yonder is John, bold Robin Hood's man,

Shall fight with thee thy fill.

down a, &c.

What is the matter ſays little John,

down a, &c.

Maſter come tell to me;

my caſe is bad, cries Robin Hood,

For the ſhepherd hath conquered me:

down a, &c.

I am glad of that, cries little John,

down a, &c.

Shepherd turn thou to me,

for about with thee I mean to have,

Either come fight or flee:

down a, &c.

With all my heart thou proud fellow,

down a, &c.

For it ſhall never be ſaid

that a ſhepherds hook of thy ſturdy look

Will one jot be diſmay'd.

That thou canſt conquer me,

The ſhepherd he began
