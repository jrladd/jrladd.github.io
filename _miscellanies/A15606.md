## The Frontespeice discovered.

This spreading Vine, like these choyce Leaves invites

The Curteous eye to tast her choyce Delights.

These painefull Bees, presented to thy view,

Shewes th'Author works not for himselfe, but you.

The windy Musick, that salutes thine eye,

Bespeakes thine Eare, thy judgement standing by.

The Devious Horseman, wandring in this Maze,

Shewes Error, and her execrable wayes:

Whose brazen Insolence, and boldnesse urges

The hornefoot Satyres to their angry Scourges:

And he that Drawes his Sword against the Swarme

Of Waspes, is he, that lasht, begins to storme.

## The Stationer to the Reader.

IF new or old wit please the reader best,

I've hope each man of wit will be our guest,

The new was fram'd to humor some mens taste;

Which if they like not, they may carve the last:

Each dish hath sauce belongs to't, and you will

By your dislike, censure the Authors skill;

Yet if you cannot speake well of it, spare

To utter your dislike, that the like snare

May entrap others; so the booke may bee

Sold, though not lik'd, by a neate fallacy:

That's all I aske yet'twill your goodnes raise,

If as I gaine your coyn, he may your praise.

### 1\. Wits Recreations.

#### 1.1. 1 To the Reader.

EXcuse me Reader though I now and than

In some light lines doe shew my selfe a man,

Nor be so sowre, some wanton words to blame

They are the language of an Epigram.

#### 1.2. 2 On Battus

Battus doth bragge he hath a world of bookes

His studies maw holds more then well it may,

But seld' or never he upon them looks

And yet he looks upon them every day,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=4)He looks upon
their out-side, but within

He never looks, nor never will begin:

Because it cleane against his nature goes

To know mens secrets, so he keeps them close.

#### 1.3. 3 On the same

I pray thee Battus, adde unto thy store

This booke of mine to make thy number more;

It is well bound, well printed, neatly strung,

And doth deserve to have a place among

Th'inhabitants of thy Vatican, if thou

Wilt so much favor to its worth allow.

#### 1.4. 4\. An evill age.

Virgill of Mars and ruthfull wars did treat,

Ovid of Venus love, and peace did write:

Yet Virgill for his strain was counted great,

And Ovid for his love was bannished quite;

No marvell then if c [...]ur [...]ezie grow cold,

When hare is prais'd and love it self control'd.

#### 1.5. 5 On a woman's will.

How dearly doth the simple husband buy,

His wiv [...]s defect of will, when she doth dy?

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=4)Bett [...]r in
death by will to let her give,

Then let her have her will whilst she doth live.

#### 1.6. 6\. To a  [...] [...]eader.

Thou say'st these verses are rude, ragged, rough,

Not like some others,  [...]imes smooth dainty  [...]uffe:

Epigrames are like satires rough without,

Like chesse-nuts sweet, take thou the kernell out.

#### 1.7. 7 Of a Iudge.

Were I to choose a Captain I would than,

Not choose your courtier or a youthfull man,

No, I would choose a judge, one grim and grave;

To make a Captain such a man I'de crave:

Give me that man, whose frowning brow is death,

I, such an one, as can kill men with breath.

#### 1.8. 8 Of Poet [...]s.

Poetus with fine sonnets painteth forth,

This and that soul Ladyes beauties worth:

He shewes small wit thereby, and for his paines,

By my consent he never shall reape gains,

Why what need poets paint them? O sweet Elves?

When Ladyes paint their beauties best themselves.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=5)

#### 1.9. 9 On an up-start.

Pray wrong not (late-coyn'd) give the man his right

He's made a gentleman although no knight,

For now 'tis cloths the gentleman doth make,

Men from gay cloths their pedigrees do take;

But wot you what's the armes to such mens house [...]

Why this—hands chacing of a rampant louse.

#### 1.10. 10 Ad Clodium.

Wir, once thou said'st was worth thy weight in gold

Though now't be common for a trifle sold;

It dearer seems to thee, that get'st not any,

When thou should'st use it, for thy love or money

#### 1.11. 11 In Getam.

Geta from wool and weaving first began,

Swelling and swelling to a gentleman,

When he was gentleman and bravely dight:

He left not swelling till he was a knight;

At last forgetting what he was at first,

He swole to be a Lord, and then he burst.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=5)

#### 1.12. 12 In Fimum.

Fimus is coach'd and for his farther grace,

Doth a ske his friends how he becomes the place;

Troth I should tell him, the poor coach hath wrong

And that a cart would serve to carry dung.

#### 1.13. 13 Asper [...]m  [...]imis condimentum.

Monsieur Albanus new invested is,

With sundry suits and fashions passing fit,

But never any came so neer as this,

For joy whereof Albanus frollique is:

Untill the Taylours bill of solvi fias,

Diverts his humor to another bias.

#### 1.14. 14 Gender and number.

Singular sins and plurall we commit;

And we in every gender vary it.

#### 1.15. 15 At [...]eists pastimes.

Grammarians talk of times past and hereafter:

I spend time present in pastime and laughter.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=6)

#### 1.16. 16 To Sr. Iohn Suckling.

If learning will beseem a Courtier well,

If honour  [...] on those who dare excell,

Then let not Poets envy but admire,

The eager flames of thy poetique fire;

For whilst the world loves wit, Aglaura shall,

Phoenix-like live after her funerall.

#### 1.17. 17 On a braggadocio.

Don Lollus brags, he comes of noble blood,

Drawn down from Brutus line; 'tis very good!

If this praise-worthy be, each flea may then,

Boast of his blood more then some gentlemen.

#### 1.18. 18 To Mr. George Sands.

Sweet-tongued Ovid, though strange tales  [...]e told,

Which gods and men did act in dayes of old,

What various shapes for love sometimes they took;

To purchase what they ay [...]'d at: could he look,

But back upon himself he would admire,

The sumptuous bravery of that rich attire;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=7)Which Sands
hath clad him with, & then place this

His change amongst their Metamorphosis.

#### 1.19. 19 To Mr. William Habbington on his Castara, a Poem.

Thy Muse is chaste and thy Castara too,

[...]Tis strange at Court, & thou hadst power to woo

And to obtain (what others were deny'd)

The fair Castara for thy vertuous bride:

Enjoy what you dare wish, and may there bee,

Fair issues branch from both, to honor thee.

#### 1.20. 20 To Mr. Francis Beaumont and Mr. Iohn Fletcher gent.

Twin-stars of poetry, whom we justly may,

Call the two-tops of learn'd Pernassus-Bay,

Peerlesse for freindship and for numbers sweet;

Whom oft the Muses swaddled in one sheet:

Your works shall still be prais'd and dearer sold,

For our new-nothings doe extoll your old.

#### 1.21. 21 On apump stopt with stones.

M.

I'le cut it down, I swear by this same hand,

If 'twill not run, it shall no longer stand.

R.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=8)

Pray  [...]ir be patient, let your pump alone,

How can it water-make when't hath the stone.

Yet did he wisely when he did it fell,

For in so doing he did make it well.

#### 1.22. 22 To Mr. Benjamin Iohnson.

Had Rome but heard her worthies speak so high,

As thou hast taught them in thy Poesie;

She would have sent her poets to obtain,

(Tutour'd by thee) thy most majestique strain.

#### 1.23. 23\. In Aulam.

Thou still art mutring Aulus in mine eare,

Love me and love my dog, I will I swear,

Thou ask'st but right and Aulus truth to tell,

I think thy dog deserves my love as well.

#### 1.24. 24 To Mr. George Chapman on his Translation of Homers works into
English meeter.

Thou Ghost of Homer 'twere no fault to call,

His the translation thine the Originall,

Did we not know 'twas done by thee so well;

Thou makest Homer, Homers self excell.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=8)

#### 1.25. 25 To Mr. William Shake-spear.

Shake-speare we must be silent in thy pra [...]se,

'Cause our encomion's will but blast thy Bayes,

Which envy could not, that thou didst do well;

Let thine own histories prove thy Chronicle.

#### 1.26. 26 Ad Tilenum.

Tilenus 'cause th'art old, fly not the field,

Where youthfull Cupid doth his banner weild

For why [...] this god, old men his souldiers stil'd

None loves, but he, who hath bin twice a child.

#### 1.27. 27 To Mr. Thomas Randolph.

Thou darling of the Muses for we may

Be thought deserving, if what was thy play

Our utmost labours can produce, we will

Freely allow thee heir unto the hill,

The Muses did assign thee, and think 't fit,

Thy younger yeares should have the elder-wit.

#### 1.28. 28 In Paulum.

Paul what my cloak doth hide thou fain wouldst know

Were't to be seen I would not cover't so.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=9)

#### 1.29. 29 Of sleep and death.

That death is but a sleep I not deny

Yet when I next would sleep, I would not dy.

#### 1.30. 30 Ad Lectorem.

Reader thou see'st how pale these papers look,

Whiles they fear thy hard censure on this book.

#### 1.31. 31 Ad Momum.

Momus thou say'st our verses are but  [...]oyes,

Tis true, yet truth is often spoken by boyes.

#### 1.32. 32 On Thraso.

Thraso goes lame with a blow he did receive,

In a late duell, if you'll him beleeve.

#### 1.33. 33 News.

When news doth come if any would discusse,

The letters of the word, resolve it thus:

News is convay'd by letter, word or mouth

And comes to us, from north, east, west and sout [...]

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=9)

Rufus had robb'd his host and being put to it;

Said I'm an arrar [...]t rogue, if I did doe it.

#### 1.35. 35 Of Marcus.

When Marcus fail'd a borrowed sum to pay,

Unto his freind at the appointed day:

'Twere superstition for a man he sayes,

To be a strict observer of set dayes.

#### 1.36. 36 Of a theefe.

A theefe arested and in custody,

Under strong guards of armed company,

Ask't why they held him so? Sir quoth the cheife▪

We hold you for none other than a theif.

#### 1.37. 37 Of motion.

Motion brings heat, and thus we see it prov'd

Most men are hot and angry, when they're mov'd

#### 1.38. 38 Ad Scriptorem.

Half of your book is to an index grown,

You give your book contents, your reader none.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=10)

#### 1.39. 39 Domi [...]a Margarita Sandis: Anagramma.  
Anne domi das Marg [...]it as?

VVhy do wee seek & saile abroad to find,

Those pearls which do adorn the female-kind,

Within our seas there comes unto our hands,

A matchlesse Margaryte among the Sands.

Man's like the earth, his hair like grasse is grown,

His veins the rivers are, his heart the stone.

Well may mans life be likened to a way,

Many be weary of their life they 'll say.

#### 1.42. 42 To Mr. Thomas May.

Thou son of Mercury whose fluent tongue

Made Lucan finish his Pharsalian song,

Think on thy scourge untill our dying-day:

Th▪ hast given us a Remembrancer which shall,

Outlast the vices we are tax'd withall,

Th [...]'ha [...]t made us both eternall, for our shame

Shall never Wyther, whilst thou hast a name.

#### 1.46. 46 On a Drawer drunk.

Drawer with thee now even is thy wine,

For thou hast peirc'd his hogs-head and he thine.

Upon her heeles, such lumps of lead to bee.

#### 1.48. 48 To Mr. Thomas Middleton.

F [...]cetious Middleton thy witty Muse,

Hath pleased all, that books or men peruse

If any thee dispise, he doth but show,

Antipathy to wit, in daring so:

Thy fam's above his malice and 'twilbe,

Dispraise enough for him, to censure thee.

#### 1.49. 49 On Cyn [...].

Because, I am not of a Giant's stature,

Despise me not, nor praise thy liberall nature,

For thy huge limbs, that you are great 'tis true,

And that I'm little in respect of you,

The reason of our growths is eas'ly had,

You many had perchance, I but one Dad.

#### 1.50. 50 To Mr. Iames Shirly on his Comedy viz. the yong Admirall.

You call my verses  [...]oyes th' are so 'tis true,

Yet they are better, then ought comes from you.

#### 1.53. 53 To Mr. Philip Massinger.

Celsus doth love himself, Celsus is wise,

For now no rivall ere can claime his prize.

Thou hast writ much and art admir'd by those,

And better please then groveling on the stage.

#### 1.59. 59 On a cowardly Souldier.

Strotzo doth weare no ring upon his hand,

[...]lthough he be a man of great command;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=12)But gilded
spurs do jingle at his heeles

Whose rowels are as big as some coach-wheels,

He grac'd them well, for in the Netherlands,

His heels d [...]d him more service then his hands.

#### 1.60. 60 To Mr. Thomas Goffe on his tragedies.

When first I heard the Turkish Emperours speak,

In such a dialect, and O [...]estes break

His silence in such language, I admir'd

What powerful favorite of the Nimphs inspir'd

Into their Souls such utterance, but I wrong,

To think 'twas learnt from any but thy tongue.

#### 1.61. 61 On Cornuto.

Cornuto is not jealous of his wife,

A froward shrew being blam'd because she show'd,

Not so much reverence as by right she ow'd

Unto her husband, she reply'd he might

Forbeare complaint of me, I do him right▪

mine, he would beare rule, and I

Desire the like, onely in sympathy.

#### 1.63. 63 On a youth married to an old woman.

Fond youth I wonder why thou didst intend

To marry her who is so neer her end,

Thy fortune I dare tell, perchance thou'lt have

At supper dainties; but in bed a grave.

#### 1.64. 64 On a dying Vsurer.

With greater grief non doth death entertain,

Then wretched Chrysalus, he sighs a mayn,

Not that he dyes, but 'cause much cost is spent

Upon the Sexton and his regiment

The joviall ringers, and the Curate must

Have his fee too, when dust is turn'd to dust,

And which is greater then the former sum,

Hee'l pay an angell for a Moor-stone-tomb.

#### 1.65. 65 On a fly in a glasse.

A fly out of his glasse a guest did take,

E're with the liquor he his thirst would slake,

When he had drunk his fill, again the fly

Into the glasse he put, and said though I

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=13)Love not
flyes in my drink, yet others may,

Whose humour I nor like, nor will gain-say.

#### 1.66. 66 On Collimus.

If that Collimus any thing do lend,

Or dog, or horse, or hawk unto his friend,

He to endear the borrowers love the more,

Nor would to any but to him: his wife

Having observ'd these speeches all her life,

Behind him forks her fingers and doth cry:

To none but you, I'd doe this courtesie.

#### 1.67. 67 Auri-sacra fames-qui [...] non?

A smoothfac'd youth was wedded to an old,

Decrepit shrew, such is the power of gold:

That love did tye this knot, the end will prove,

The love of money not the god of love.

#### 1.68. 68 On Sex [...]us.

What great revenews Sextus doth possesse,

When as his sums of gold are numberlesse,

What cannot Sextus have? I wonder then,

Sextus cann't live as well as other men.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=14)

#### 1.69. 69 Good wits jump.

Against a post a scholler chanc'd to strike,

At unawares his head, like will to like:

Good wits will jump (quoth he) if that be true

The title of a block-head is his due.

#### 1.70. 70 On Womens Maskes.

It seems that Masks do women much disgrace,

Sith when they weare them they do hide their face.

#### 1.71. 71 On Lepidus and his wife.

Lepidus married somewhile to a shrew,

She sick'ned, he in jesting wise to shew

How glad her death would make him; said sweet-heart

I pray you e're you sing loath to depart

Tell who shall be my second wife, and I

After your death will wed her instantly,

She somewhat vext hereat, straightway reply'd

Then let grim Pluto's daughter be your bride.

He answer'd wife I would your will obey,

But that our laws my willingnesse gain-say:

For he who Pluto's sister takes to wife,

Cannot his daughter too upon my life.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=14)

#### 1.72. 72 Vpon a pair of Tongs.

The burnt child dreads the fire; if this be true,

Who first invented tongs it's fury knew.

#### 1.73. 73 On Celsus his works.

Celsus to please himselfe, a book hath writ:

It seem's so, for there's few that buyeth it.

He is no popular man it thereby seems;

Sith men condemn, what he praise worthy deems,

Yet this his wisdome and his book prefer,

Disprais'd by all, they think both singular.

#### 1.74. 74 The Devill and the Fryar.

The Devill was once deceived by a fryar,

Who though he sold his soul cheated the buyer,

The devill was promist if he would supply,

The Fryar with coyn at his necessity,

When all the debts he ow'd discharg'd were quite,

The Devill should have his soul as his by right,

The Devill defray'd all scores, payd all, at last,

Demanded for his due, his soul in haste:

The Fryar return'd this answer, if I ow

You any debts at all, then you must know,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=15)I am indebted
still, if nothing be

Due unto you, why do you trouble me?

#### 1.75. 75 To Phillis.

Aske me not Phillis why I do refuse

To kisse thee as the most of gallants use,

For seeing oft thy dog to fawn and skip

Upon thy lap and joyning lip to lip,

Although thy kisses I full fain would crave;

Yet would I not thy dog my rivall have.

#### 1.76. 76 Of Charidem [...]s.

Although thy neighbour have a handsom horse,

Matchlesse for comly shape, for hue and course

And though thy wife thou knowest ill-shapen  [...]e,

Yet Charidemus praises mightily,

His ugly wife and doth the horse dispraise:

How subtilly the fox his engin layes,

For he desires his neighbours horse to buy,

And sell his wife to any willingly.

#### 1.77. 77 Of Clytus.

Clytus the barber doth occasion fly,

Because 'tis bal'd and he gains nought thereby.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=15)

#### 1.78. 78 On Balbus.

Balbus a verse on Venus, boy doth scan,

But ere 'twas fini [...]'d Cupid's grown a man.

#### 1.79. 79 On Comptulus.

I wonder'd Comptulus, how thy long hair

In comely curles could show so debonair

And every hair in order be, when as

Thou could'st not trim it by a looking-glasse,

Nor any barber did thy tresses pleat,

'Tis strange; but Monsieur I conceive the feat

When you your hair do kemb, you off it take

And order 't as you please for fashions sake.

#### 1.80. 80 On Gellius.

In building of his house, Gellius hath spent

All his revenews and his ancient rent,

Aske not a reason why Gellius is poor.

His great house hath turn'd him out of door.

#### 1.81. 81 To Ponticus.

At supper-time will Poutus visit me,

I'd rather have his room then companie;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=16)But if him▪
from me I can no wayes fright,

I'd have him visit me each fasting night.

#### 1.82. 82 On a Pot-poet.

What lofty verses Cael [...]s writes? it is,

But when his head with wine oppressed is,

So when great drops of rain fall from the skyes

In standing pools, huge bubles will arise.

#### 1.83. 83 On Onellus.

Thou never supp'st abroad, Onellus, true;

For at my home I'm sure to meet with you.

#### 1.84. 84 On Wine.

What? must we then on muddy tap-lash swill,

Neglecting sack? which makes the poet's quill

To thunder forth high raptures, such as when

Sweet-tongued Ovid erst with his smooth pen,

In flourishing Rome did write; frown god of win [...]

To see how most men disesteem thy Vines.

#### 1.85. 85 On beere.

Is no juice pleasing but the grapes? is none,

So much beloved? doth perfection,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=16)Onely conjoyn
in wine? or doth the well

Of Aganippe with this liquor swell,

That Po [...]ts thus affect it? shall we crown,

A meer ex [...]tique? and contemn our own,

Our native liquor? haunt who list the grape,

He more esteem our Oate, whose reed shall make,

An instrument to warble forth her praise,

Which shall survive untill the date of daies,

And eke invoke some potent power divine,

To patronize her worth above the vine.

#### 1.86. 86 On a vaunting Poetaster.

C [...]cilius boasts his verses worthy bee,

To be engraven on a Cypresse tree,

A Cypresse wreath befits 'em well; 'tis true,

For they are neer their death, and crave but due.

#### 1.87. 87 On Philos.

If Philos, none but those are dead, doe praise,

I would I might displease him all his dayes.

#### 1.88. 88 On a valiant Souldier.

teadious battle, when they were

Enforc'd for want of bullets to forbear,

Farther to encounter, which the Savage Moor

Perceiving, scoff'd, and nearer then before,

Approach'd the Christian host, the souldier grie [...]

To be out brav'd, yet could not be reliev'd

Beyond all patience vex'd, he said although

I bullets want, my self will wound the foe;

Then from his mouth, took he a tooth and sent,

A fatall message to their regiment,

What armes will fury steed men with, when we.

Can from our selves have such artillery;

Sampson thy jaw-bone can no trophy reare

Equall to his, who made his tooth his speare.

#### 1.89. 89 On Aurispa.

#### 1.91. 91 On Alexander the great.

If Alexander thought the world but small

Because his conquering hand subdu'd it all,

He should not then have stil'd himself the great,

An Infants stool can be no giants seat.

If vertue's alwaies in thy mouth, how can

It ere have time to reach thy heart fond man?

#### 1.93. 93 On a land-skip in the lid of his Mrs. Virginals.

Behold Don Phoebus in yon shady grove,

On his sweet harp plaies Roundelaies of love,

Mark how the fatyr grim Marsyas playes

On his rude pipe, hi [...] merry-harmlesse layes,

Mark how the swaines attentively admire,

Both to the sound of pipe and tang of lyre;

But if you on these Virginals will play,

They both will cast their instruments away,

And deeming it the  [...]sique of the Spheares

Admire your musique as the swains do theirs

Can one man hold him fast? 'twas answerd I,

If then one man can hold him sir, you may

Do it your self, quoth he, and slunk away.

#### 1.98. 98 On an inevitable Cuckold.

Two wives th' hast buried and another wed,

Yet neither of the three chaste to thy bed,

Wherefore thou blam'st not onely them, but all

Their Sex into disgrace and scorn dost call,

Yet if the thing thou wilt consider well,

Thou wilt thy malice, and this rage expell,

For when the three were all alike 't should seem

Thy stars gave thee the Cuckold's anadem,

If thou wert born to be a wittoll, can

Thy wife prevent thy fortune? foolish man!

That woman which a Hellen is to thee,

Would prove another mans Penelope.

#### 1.99. 99 On an empty house.

But battle joynd he fled away in haste,

And said I had forgot, this night I fast.

#### 1.101. 101 On a great nose.

Thy nose no man wipe, Proclus unlesse

He have a hand as big as Hercules,

When thou dost sneeze the sound thou dost not heare,

Thy nose is so far distant from thine eare.

#### 1.102. 102 On an unequall paire.

Faire Pbi [...]is is to churlish Pris [...]us wed,

As stronger wine with waters mingled,

Priscus his love to Phillis more doth glow;

With fervency then fire, her's cold as snow;

'Tis well for if their flames alike did burn,

One house would be to hot to serve their turn.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=19)

#### 1.103. 103 On a changeable raiment.

Know you why Lollus changeth every day,

His Perriwig, his face and his array,

'Tis not because his commings in are much,

Or cause hee'll swill it with the roaring dutch;

But 'cause the Sergeants (who a writ have had

Long since against him) should not know the lad.

#### 1.104. 104 On the ensuring office.

Linus met Thuscus on the burse by chance,

And swore he'd drink a health to th'heir of France

For on th' exchange for currant news 'twas told,

France had a Daulphin not yet seaven dayes old,

Thuscus excus'd himself, and said he must

By all meanes go to th' ensuring office first,

And so ensure some goods, he doubted were,

Unlikely else ere to his hands appeare,

Linus replyd Ile with thee then, for I

Would have my lands ensur'd to me in fee

Which otherwise I doubt, I never shall,

From debt and morgage ere redeem at all.

We bandied are by every stroke of sin,

Then onely this can I commend in thee,

Thou actest well our frail mortalitie.

#### 1.106. 106 On Barossa.

Barossa boasts his pedegree although,

He knows no letter of the Christ-crosse-row,

His house is ancient, and his gentry great,

For what more ancient e're was heard of yet

Then is the family of fools, how than

Dare you not call Barossa gentleman?

#### 1.107. 107 On Clodius Albinus.

Clodius great cheer for supper doth prepare,

Buyes Chickens, Rabbets, Phesants and a hare,

Great store of fowl, variety of fish,

And tempting sawce serv'd in, in every dish,

To this great feast, whom doth he meane t' envite,

Aloinus only sups with him to night.

But happy chance tall Afer in his pride,

Mounts a Gunnelly and on foot doth ride.

#### 1.109. 109 On Balbulus.

Thou do'st complaine poets have no reward

And now adayes they are in no regard:

Verses are nothing worth, yet he that buyes,

Ought that is thine, at a three- [...] price,

Will think it too too dear, and justly may

Think verses are in price, since  [...] other day,

Yea who ere buies 'em at a farthing rate,

At the same price can never sell 'em at.

#### 1.110. 110 To Lycus.

That poetry is good and pleasing thou dost cry,

Yet know'st not when 'tis right or when awry

And now turn'd Pander he doth sell his wife.

#### 1.116. 116 On Women.

Women are books and men the readers be,

In whom oft times they great Errata's see;

Here sometimes wee a blot, there wee espy

A leafe misplac'd, at least a line awry;

If they are books, I wish that my wife were

An Almanacke to change her every yeare

#### 1.117. 117 On Acerra.

Tobacco hurts the braine phisicians say,

Of famous Shake-spear? or som drunken host?

Dost think thy rimes shall daunt my soul with fear

And when th' art dead, write this upon thy herse;

Here lies a Poet that was robb'd in verse.

#### 1.123. 123 Vpon Clarinda begging a lock of her lovers haire.

Fairest Clarinda, she whom truth cals faire,

Begg'd my heart of mee, and a lock of haire

Should I give both said I, how should I live,

The lock I would, the heart I would not give,

For that lest [...]heeving love should steal away,

Discretion had lock'd up and kept the key;

As for the locke of haire, which lovers use

My head laid on her knee I pray'd her chuse,

Taking her  [...]izars by a cunni [...]g art,

First pick'd the lock, and then she stole my heart.

#### 1.124. 124 To his Mistris.

Dearest thy twin'd haires are not threds of gold,

Nor thine eyes diamonds, nor do I hold,

Thy lips for rubies, nor thy cheeks to bee,

Fresh roses, nor thy dugs of Ivory,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=25)The skin that
doth thy dainty body sheath,

Nor Alablaster is, nor dost thou breath,

Arabian odours, these the earth brings forth,

Compar'd with thine, they would impair thy worth;

Such then are other mistrisses, but mine,

Hath nothing earth, but all divine.

#### 1.125. 125 The Answer.

If earth doth never change, nor move,

There's nought of earth, sure in thy love,

Sith heavenly bodies with each one,

Concur in generation,

And wanting gravitie are light,

Or in a borrowed lustre bright;

If meteors and each falling star

Of heavenly matter framed are:

Earth hath my mistrisse, but sure thine

All heavenly is, though not divine.

#### 1.126. 126 On his Mrs.

I saw faire Flora take the aire,

When P [...]aehus shin'd and it was faire;

That he was barr'd from kissing thee

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=25)Then Bore as

Thus to mix his breath with thine.

#### 1.127. 127 On an houre glasse.

Here running in this glasse

By atomes mov'd

Turn'd to cinders by her eye:

Yes and in death as life, have it expre [...]t

That lovers ashes take no rest.

#### 1.128. 128 On the picture of Cupid in a jewell worn by his Mrs. on her
brest.

Little Cupid enter in and heat

Her heart, her brest is not thy seat;

Her brests are fitted to entice

Lovers, but her heart's ofice,

Thaw Cupid, that it hence forth grow

Tender still by answering no.

#### 1.129. 129 On his Mistris.

When first I saw thee thou didst sweetly play,

The gentle theefe, and stol'st my heart away;

Ren [...]er me mine againe, or leave thy own,

Two are too much for thee since I have none;

But if thou wilt not I will swear thou art

A sweet-fac'd creature with a double heart.

#### 1.130. 130 On Cupid.

Cupid hath by his sly and subtill art,

A certaine arrow shot and peirc't my heart:

What shall I doe to be reveng'd on love?

There is but one way and that one I'le prove;

I'le steale his arrowes and will head them new,

With womens hearts and then they will fly true.

#### 1.131. 131 On a Tobacconist.

All dainty meats I do defie,

Which feed men fat as swine,

Hee is a frug all man indeed,

That on a leafe can dine,

He needs no napkin for his hands

His fingers ends to wipe,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=26)That keeps
his kitchin in a box

And roast- [...] in a pipe.

#### 1.132. 132 On the same.

If mans flesh be like swines, as it is said

The metamorphosis is sooner made

Then full-fac'd Gnatho no tobacco take

Smoaking your corps, lest bacon you do make.

Thou'lt sit to't harder then thou dist before.

Cold rheumes expeller and the wits direction,

I hate a lie, and yet a lye did run

Of noble Goring's death and Kensington,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=27)And for that
they did not untimely dye

I love a lye because that was a ly,

For had it been an accident of ruth

'T had made me grow in hatred of the truth,

Though lies be bad, yet give this lye it's due,

'Tis ten times better, then if 't had been true.

#### 1.138. 138 A Crab's Restorative.

Am I an instrument to make you sport,

A fiddle-stick I am, ye shann't report

That ere yee hand'led me in such a case;

To make me strike up fiddles mean and base,

Nay you shall never bend me to your bow

It goeth against the haire you should do so,

Nor shall you curbe me in, thus every day,

I'le but my pleasure, I was made to play;

But here I must not play upon another,

Why have I then a fiddle for my brother?

If I were gon, you'd be compel'd my freinds

To make your musique on your fingers ends:

My brother fiddle is so hollow hearted,

That ere't be long, we must needs be parted

And with so many frets he doth abound,

That I can never touch him but hee'l sound:
[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=28) [...]
[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=28) [...]

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=29)When hee's
reviv'd, this poore excuse he puts,

That when I play, I vex him to the guts;

But since it is my nature, and I must

I'le crowd and scrape acquaintance for a crust;

I am a genleman of high descent

Come from Apollos glorious element,

Above the bridge I alwayes use to keep,

And that's my proper spheare, when I do sleep,

So that I cannot be in tune or town,

For all my scraping if the bridge be down;

But since without an end, nought can endure,

A fiddle-stick hath two ends to be sure.

#### 1.141. 141 On hopes of preferment.

I saw my fortune goe before

As Palinurus saw the shore,

If that I dye, before it hitch,

Wel-fare mine eyes for they are rich.

#### 1.142. 142 Sorte tu [...] contentus.

And will that thou an asse must bee;

His fellow traveller.

#### 1.147. 147 B. I. approbation of a copy of verses.

One of the witty sort of gentlemen,

That held society with learned Ben—

Shew'd him some verses of such Tragique sense

They did his curious eare much violence;

But after Ben had been a kind partaker

Of the sad lines, he needs must know the maker;

What unjust man he was, that spent his time

And banish'd reason to, advance his rime:

Nay gentle Ben, replies the gentleman

I see I must support the Poet than;

Although those humble straines are not so fit

For to please you, hee's held a pretty wit;

Is he held so? (sa [...]es Ben) so may a goose,

Had I the holding, I would let him loose.

She might have bin to greater fortunes brought)

With rigid looks, bent brows, and words austere

Ask'd his forc'd son in law, how he did dare

(Without a full consenting from him carried)

Thus beare his onely daughter to be married,

And by what Cannons he assum'd such power?

He sayd the best in England sir, the Tower.

#### 1.149. 149 A Gentlemans satisfaction for spitting in anothers face.

A gentleman (not in malice nor disgrace,

But by a chance) spet in anothers face,

He that receiv'd it, knowing not the cause

That should produce such rashne [...] ('gainst the law [...]

Of Christian man-hood or civility)

In kindling anger, ask'd the reason why;

Pray  [...]ir sayes he, what thing that doth but sound

Like to an injury have you ere found

By me at any time? or if you had,

It never could deserve contempt so bad

'Tis an inhumane custome none ere use;

But the vile nation of conte [...]ned Jewes:

Pray sir, cryes th' other be not so unkind,

Thus with an accident to charge my minde

I meant it not, but  [...]nce it fals out so,

I'm sorry, yea make satisfaction too;

mov'd but let this ease your doubt

Since I have spet, please you, I'le tread it out.

#### 1.150. 150 On a little Gentleman and one Mr. Story.

The little man, by th' other mans vain-glory,

It seems was roughly us'd (so say's the story)

But being a little h [...]ated and high blown,

In anger flyes at Story, puls him down;

And when they rise (I know not how it fated)

One got the worst, the Story was tran [...]ated

From white to red, but ere the fight was ended

It seemes a Gentleman that one be [...]riended

Came in and parted them; the little blade,

There's none that could intreat, or yet perswade,

But he would fight still, till another came,

And with sound reasons councel'd gainst the same

'T was in this manner friend ye shall not fight

With one that's so unequall to your height,

Story is higher, th' othe [...] made reply,

I'd pluck him down were he three Stories high.

#### 1.151. 151 On a Welshman and an Englishman.

There was a time a difference began

Between a Welshman and an Englishman,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=31)And thus it
was; the English-man would stand

Against all argument, that this our land,

Was fre [...]st of her fruits, there is a place

Quoth he, whose ground, so fruitfull is of grasse;

But throw a staffe in't but this night, you shall

Not See't the morrow, 't would be cover'd all:

The Welsh-man cry'd 'tis true, it might ly under,

The o're-grown grasse,  [...] is with us no wonder,

For turn your horse into our frui [...]full ground,

And before morning come, he shann't be found.

We praise the faire, and our inventions wrack,

In pleasing numbers to applaud the black,

We court this Ladies eye, that Ladyes haire,

The faire love black, the black best like the faire [...]

Yet neither sort, I court, I doate upon

Nor faire nor black, but a complexion

More rare then either; she that is the crown

Of my entire affection is brown,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=32)And yet shees
faire, 'tis strange, how can it be,

That two complexions should in one agree

Do I love Brown, my love can please mine eye,

And  [...]ate my narrow'st curiosity,

If I like faire, she hath so sweet a grace,

That I could leave an Angell for her face,

Let any judge then, which complexion's rarest,

In my opinion, she is Brown that's fairest.

#### 1.154. 154 On Garret and Chambers.

Garret and his friend Chambers having done

Their Citty bus'nesse walk'd to Paddington,

And comming neer the fatall place where men

I meane offenders ne're return agen,

Looking on Tyborn in a merryment,

Sayes Chambers here's a pretty Tenement

Had it a garret: Garret hearing that,

Replyes friend Chambers I do wonder at

Your simple censure, and could mock you for it,

There must be chambers ere there be a garret.

Where only faith is taught

No matter for good works

Make's Christians worse then Turks

Saying sith your brawn, out of your mouth doth slip,

Shee makes the heart a servant to the tongue.

#### 1.330. 328 On poverty.

If thou be poor, thou shalt be ever so.

None now doe wealth but on the rich bestow.

#### 1.331. 329 Women are mens shadowes:

Follow a shaddow it still flies you,

Seeme to fly, it will pursue:

So court a mistrisse shee denies you,

Let her alone, she will court you.

Say are not women tr [...]ely then,

Stil'd but the shadwoes of us men?

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=61)At morne and
even shades are longest,

At noone they are, or short or none:

So men at weakest they are strongest;

But grant us perfect they're not known.

Say are not women truely then

stil'd but the shadowes of us men?

#### 1.332. 330 In ebriosum.

Fy man (saith shee) but I tell mistrisse An [...]e,

Her drunken husband is no drunken man:

For those wits, which are overcome with drink,

Are voyd of reasons and are beasts I thinke.

#### 1.333. 331 Wills errour.

Will sayes his wife's so fat, shee scarce can goe,

But shee as nimbly answers faith sir no:

Alas good Will thou art mistaken quite,

For all men know, that shee is wondrous light.

#### 1.334. 332 On Rome.

Hate & debate, Rome through the world hath spred,

Yet Ro [...]a a mock is if backeward read:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=62)Then is
[...]t not strange, Rome hate should foster? no,

For out of backward love all hate doth grow.

#### 1.335. 333

All things have savour, though some very small,

Nay a box on  [...]he eare hath no smell at all.

#### 1.336. 334 Act, fortune, and ignorance.

Love hath two divers wings, as lovers say,

Thou following him, with one he flies away:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=62)With th'
other, if thou fly, he followes thee,

Therefore the last, Love, onely use for me.

#### 1.339. 337 On the same.

Love, as tis said, doth work with such strange tools,

That he can make fooles wise-men, wise-men fools:

Then happy I, for being nor foole nor wise,

Love with his toyes and tooles I shall despise.

#### 1.340. 338 On a wanton.

Some the word wanton fetch, though with sinal ski [...]

From those that want one to effect their will:

If so, I thinke that wantons there are none,

For till the world want men, can they want one!

#### 1.341. 339 In procos:

Who woes a wife, thinks wedded men do know▪

The onely true content, I thinke not so:

If Woe in wooers bee, that women court,

As the word Woe in wooers doth import:

And Woe in woemen too, that courted be,

As the word Woe, in women we doe see:
[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=63) [...]
[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=63) [...]

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=64)I thinke 'tis
better lead a single life,

Then with this double woe to wooe a wife.

#### 1.342. 340 Ingluviem sequitur fames:

Curio would feed upon the daintyest fare,

That with the court or countrey might compare:

For what let's Curio that he need to care,

To frolique freely with the proud'st that dare:

But this excesse was such in all things rare,

As he prov'd banquerout e're he was aware.

#### 1.343. 341 In Corbum.

Corbus will not, perswade him all I can,

The world should take him for an gentle-man:

His reason [...]s this, because men should not deeme,

That he is such, as he doth never seem.

#### 1.344. 342 On Priscus mistrisse.

Priscus commends his mistrisse for a girle,

Whose lips be rubies, and whose teeth are pearl:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=64)Th' had need
prove so, or else it will be found,

He payes too deare; they cost him many a pound.

#### 1.345. 343 On Women.

Women thinke wo—men far more constant bee,

Then wee men, and the letter O wee see:

In wo—men▪ not in we men, as they say,

Figures earth's constant Orbe; we men say nay:

It meanes the moone, which proves (none thinke it strange

women are constant, & most true in change

#### 1.346. 344 On Promises.

My Mistrisse sweares shee'd leave all men for me,

Yea though that Iove himselfe should rivall be:

Shee sweares it, but what women sweare to kind-

-Loves, may be writ in rapid seas and winde.

#### 1.347. 345 To his mistrisse.

Take, oh take those lips a way,

That so sweetly were for-sworne:

And those eies like breake of day.

Lights that doe mislead he morne:

But my kisses bring againe,

Seales of love, though seal'd in vaine.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=65)Hide, oh hide
those hills of snow,

Which thy frozen bosome beares:

On whose tops the pinkes that grow,

Are of those that Aprill weares:

But first set my poor heart free,

Bound in those icie chaines by thee.

#### 1.348. 346 On souldiers.

Not faith, nor conscience common souldiers carry,

Best pay, is right; their hands are mercinary.

#### 1.349. 347 In Diogenem & Craesum:

When the tubb'd Cynicke went to hell, and there,

Found the pale ghost of golden Craesus bare,

Hee stops; and jeering till he shrugges againe,

Sayes O! thou richest king of kings what gaine

Have all thy large heapes brought thee, since I spie

Thee here alone, and poorer now then I?

For all I had, I with me bring; but thou,

Of all thy wealth haft not one farthing now.

#### 1.350. 348 On a barber.

Suppose my Barber, when his razors nigh

My throat, should then aske wealth and liberty:

sure, the Barber askes not this,

No, tis a Thiefe and feare imperious is.

#### 1.351. 349 Drusiu [...] and Furio.

Furio would fight with Drusius iu the field,

Because the Straw, stout Drusiu [...] would not yeeld,

On which their mistrisse trod, they both tid meet,

Drusius in fight fell dead at Furios feet,

One had the Straw, but with it this greek letter

The other lo [...]t it, pray who had the better?

#### 1.352. 350 On Cupid.

Love is a boy, and subject to the rod

Some say, but lovers say he is a god:

I thinke that love is neither god nor boy,

But a mad-braines imaginary toy.

#### 1.353. 351 On Durus.

A friend of Durus comming on a day

To visite him, finding the doores say nay;

[...] lock'd fast up, first knocks, and then doth Pause,

As Lord have mercy on's had bin the cause;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=66)But missing
it, he ask't a neighbour by

When the rich Duru's were lock'd and why?

He said it was a Custome growne of late

At diner time to lock your great man's gate.

Durus' his poor friend admir'd & thought the doo [...]

Was not for State lock'd up, but 'gainst the poore,

And thence departing empty of good cheere,

Said, Lord have mercy on us, is not there.

#### 1.354. 352\. On a Puritane.

That through their pride have broke their necks at last.

#### 1.356. 354 On Bibens.

Bibens to shew his liberality,

Made Lusus drunk; a noble quality,

To be the signe of his familiar-love.

Lusus beware, thou'lt finde him in the end,

Familiar devill, no familiar friend.

#### 1.357. 355 On Tobacco.

Things which are common, common men do use,

The better sort do common things refuse:

Yet countrys-cloth-breech, & court-velvet-hose,

Puff both alike, Tobacco, through the nose.

#### 1.358. 356 In Superbum.

Rustick Superbus fine new cloath's hath got,

Of Taffata and Velvet, fair in sight;

The shew of which hath so bewitch'd the sot,

That he thinks Gentleman to be his right.

But he's deceiv'd; for, true that is of old,

An Ape's an Ape, though he wear cloth of gold.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=67)

#### 1.359. 357 On Infidus.

Infidus was so free of oathes last day,

But now such is his chance, whereat h [...]'s griev'd,

The more he swears, the lesse he is believ'd.

#### 1.360. 358 On Christmas-Ivy.

At Christmas men do alwaies Ivie get,

And in each corner of the house it set.

But why do they, then, use that Bacchus weed?

Because they mean, then, Bacchus-like to feed.

#### 1.361. 359 On Bacchus.

Pot-lifting-Bacchus, to the earth did bend

His k [...]ee, to drink a Health unto his friend:

And there he did, so long, in liquor pour,

That he lay quite sick-drunk upon the floor.

Judge, was not there a drunkards kindnes shown,

To drink his friend a Health, and lose his own?

#### 1.362. 360 Of a fat man.

He's rich, that hath great in-comes by the year;

Then that great belly'd man is rich, Ile swear:

Had he not daily had great comings-in.

Thou maist at any time kick out the rest.

#### 1.364. 363 On Flaccus.

Flaccus being yong, they said he was a Gull;

Of his s [...]mplicity, each mouth was full:

And pitying him, they'd say, the foolish Lad

Would be deceived, sure, of all he had.

His youth is past, now may they turn him loose;

For why? the Gull is grown to be a Goose.

#### 1.365. 363 Per plumas anser.

See how y [...]ng Rufus walks in green each day,

As if he ne'r was youthfull untill now:

E're Christmas next, his green Goose will be gray,

And those high burnish'd plumes in's cap will bow.

wrong him, since his purse is full▪

To call him Goose, that is so yong a Gull.

#### 1.366. 364 Of Ienkyn.

Ienkyn is a rude clown, go tell him so.

What need I tell, what he himself doth know?

Perhaps he doth not, then he is a sot;

For tell me, what knows he that knows it not?

#### 1.367. 365 To Fortune.

Poets say Fortune's blinde, and cannot see,

And therefore to be born withall, if she

Sometimes drop gifts on undeserving wights:

But sure they are deceiv'd; she hath her sight,

Els could it not at all times so fall out,

That fools should have, & wise men go with­out.

With earthen plate, Agathocles, they say,

Did use to meal; so serv'd with Samo's clay,

When jewell'd plate, and rugged earth was by,

He seem'd to mingle wealth and poverty.

One ask'd the cause: he answers, I that am

Si [...]ilia's King, from a poor Potter came.

To sudden riches, to be temperate.

#### 1.369. 367 On Leucus.

#### 1.370. 368 On Biscus.

I pray you Sir, give Biscus leave to speak,

The Gander loves to hear himself to creak.

#### 1.371. 369 In Thrasonem.

Since Thraso met one stoutly in the field,

He crakes his spirit, & knows not how to yield;

Looks big, swears, strouts with set-side-arms the streets,

Yet gently yields the wal to al he meets.

And to his friends that asks the reason, why?

His an [...]wer's this, My self I grace thereby:

For every one the common proverb knows,

That alwaies to the wall the weakest go's.

#### 1.377. 375 On Clym.

Clym cals his wife, & reck'ning all his neighbors,

Will in a wilfull humour, needs would wed

A wench of wonder, but without a stock;

I hope his stock may serve to graff upon.

#### 1.379. 377 On Womens f [...]ults.

Is naught in words, and naught in deeds.

#### 1.380. 378 Si hodie tibi, cras mihi.

A scornfull Dame, invited over-night,

To come and dine next morrow with a Knight,

Refus'd his sudden bidding with disdain.

To whom this message was return'd again;

Sith with so short time she could not dispence,

To pray her come at that day Twelve-moneth hence.

#### 1.381. 379 On Law.

Our Civill-Law doth seem a Royall thing,

It hath more Titl [...]s than the Spanish King:

But yet the Common-Law quite puts it down,

In getting, like the Pope, so many a Crown.

#### 1.382. 380 Better lost than found.

Lo here's a Coyner, yet he fears no death,

For he ne'r stamps in mettall, but in breath:

Swears from Believe me, & Good-faith & troth,

Up to God-damn-me; and without an oath

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=71) Protests in

Cantus that Wooll-ward went, was wondred at;

therefore if no linnen thee begirt,

The naked truth will prove, thou hast no shirt.

#### 1.387. 385 On Severus.

Severus is extreme in Eloquence,

For he creates rare phrase, but rarer sence:

Unto his Serving-man, alias, his Boy.

H [...] utters speech exceeding quaint and coy;

Diminitive, and my defective slave,

My Corps Coverture, and immediately,

T'insconce my person from frigidity.

His man believes all's Welsh his master spoke,

Till he rails English, Rogue, go fetch my Cloak.

#### 1.388. 386 On a Gallant.

What Gallant's that, whose oathes fly through mine ears?

How like a Lord of Pluto's Court he swears!

How Dutch-man like he swallows down his drink!

How sweet he takes Tobacco, til he stink!

How lofty sprighted, he disdains a Boor:

How faithfull hearted he is to a—!

How cock-tail proud he doth himself advance!

How rare his Spurs do ring the Morri [...]e-dance!

He and his Boy will make a proper Man.

#### 1.389. 387 Against Caius.

Twenty small pieces I'd have borrowed late,

He cry's, Turn Lawyer, and thou'lt thrive: I' [...] have

No Conncell, Caius, give me what I crave.

#### 1.390. 388 On Vertue, Milla's maid.

Sir, all alive, and have the world at will.

#### 1.394. 391 On Otho.

Three daughters Otho hath, his onely heirs,

But will by no means let them learn to write;

The yongest now's with childe; who taught her then,

Or of her self learn'd she to hold her pen?

Some look'd too pale, some seem'd too fiery red,

Some brown, some black, and some ill fashioned.

Good Lord (quoth she) you all are much to blame,

Let's alone, and praise the maker of the same:

Her Chamber maid, who heard her, standing by,

Said, then love me, for that you know was I.

#### 1.410. 407 Non p [...]nna, sed  [...]sus.

Caius accounts himselfe accurst of men,

Only because his Lady loves him not:

Who, till he taught her, could not hold her Pen,

And yet hath since, another Tutor got.

Caius, it seems, thy skill she did but cheapen,

And means to try him at another weapen.

#### 1.411. 408 An absolute Gallant.

If you will see true valour here display'd,

Heare Poly-phemus, and be not afraid:

D'ye see me wrong'd, and will ye thus restrain me?

Sir let me go, for by these hilts I'le braine ye.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=77) Shall a base
patch, with appearance wrong me?

I'le kill the villaine, pray do not prolong me;

Call my Tobacco pu [...]rified stuffe?

Tell me it stinks? say it is drosse I snuffe?

Sirrah what are you? why sir what would you?

I am a Prentice, and will knock you too:

O are you so? I cry you mercy then,

I am to fight with none but Gentlemen.

#### 1.412. 409 In Dolentem.

Two Gentlemen of hot and fiery sp'rite,

Took boat and went up west-ward to go fight;

Embarked both, for Wend-worth they set Sail,

And there arriving with a happy gale.

The Water-men discharged for their fare,

Then to be parted, thus their minds declare:

Pray Oares, say they, stay here, and come not nigh,

We go to fight a little, but here by:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=77) The Water-
men, with Staves did follow then,

And cry'd, oh hold your hands, good Gentlemen,

You know the danger of the Law, forbear;

So they put weapons up, and fell to swear.

#### 1.414. 411 On a Gallant.

Sirrah come hither, boy, take view of me,

My Lady I am purpos'd to go see;

What, doth my Feather flourish with a grace?

And this my curled hair become my face?

How decent doth my doublet's forme appear?

I would I had my sute in Hounds-ditch here.

Do not my Spurs pronounce a silv [...]r sound?

Is not my hose-circumference profound?

Sir these be well, but there is one thing ill,

Your Taylor with a sheet of paper-bill,

Vow's he'll be paid, and Sergeants he hath fee'd▪

Which wait your comming forth to do the deed.

Boy God-a-mercy, let  [...] Lady stay,

I'le see no Counter for her sake to day▪

Th'art certain never to have crosse agen.

#### 1.417. 414 Opus & Vsus.

Opus for need, consum'd his wealth apace,

And ne're would cease untill he was undone;

Than Opus did although the eldest Son.

Opus had all the Land, Vsus the Wit.

#### 1.418. 415 A good Wi [...]e.

A Batchelor would have a Wife were wis [...],

Faire, rich, and yong, a maiden for his his bed—

A Country huswife, in the City bred.

He should bespeak her, there's none ready made.

If thy kind Nature, will affoord me grace,

Hereafter love me in thy body's place.

#### 1.422. 419 On Zeno.

Zeno would faine th'old widow Egle have;

It needs no proof, for every one can tell:

So strong's her love, tha [...] if I not mist ake,

It doth extend to others, for his sake.

#### 1.426. 423 On Priscus.

Why still doth Priscus strive to have the wall?

#### 1.427. 424 Ictus piscator sapit.

Brutus at length escap'd the Surgeons hands,

Begins to frollique as if all were well;

Endure the brunt of such another hell;

#### 1.428. 425 On Rufus.

At all, quoth Rufus, set ye, what you dare?

I'le throw at all, and 'twere a peck of gold;

No life lies on't, then coyn I'le never spare,

Why Rufus, that's the cause of all that's sold.

For with franck gamesters it doth oft befall,

they throw at all, till thrown quite out of all.

#### 1.429. 426 On Tobacco.

Tobacco is a weed of so great power,

One ask'd a mad-man if a wife he had?

A wife, quoth he, I never was so mad.

#### 1.435. 432 To Scilla.

If it be true, that promise is a debt,

Then Scill [...] will her freedome hardly get;

For if she hath vow'd her service to so many,

She'll neither pay them all, nor part from any.

Yet she to satisfy her debts, desires

To yeild her body (as the La [...] r [...]quires.)

#### 1.436. 433 Nescis, quid serus vesper vehat.

Lyncus deviseth as he lies in bed,

What new apparrell, he were best to make him:

Did for his old  [...]uit lay him up, that day.

#### 1.437. 434 To Ficus.

Ficus hath lost his nose, but knows not how,

And that seems strange to every one that knows it:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=81) Methinks I
see it written in his brow,

How, wherefore, and the cause that he did loose it.

To tell you true, Ficus I thus suppose,

'Twas some French Caniball, bit off your nose.

#### 1.438. 435 Of Arnaldo.

With our feet forward, to our grave doth bring us:

What is lesse ours, than this our borrowed breat [...]?

We stumble into life, we go to death.

#### 1.442. 439 On bad de [...]tors.

Bad debtors are good lyers; for they say,

I'le pay you without fail, on such a day:

Come is the day, to come the debt is still,

So still they lye, though stand in debt they will.

But Fulcus hath so oft ly'd in this wise,

That now he lies in Lud-gate for his lyes.

Panurgus pryes in high and low affairs,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=82) [...]

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=83)But for his
own, he neither counts nor cares;

That he refers to fortune and his  [...]ate,

His neighbors faults straight in his face he'l find,

But in a bag he laps his own behind.

#### 1.445. 442 To a sleeping talker.

In sleep thou talk'st unfore-thought mysteries,

And utter'st unfore-seen things, with close eyes:

How wel wouldst thou discourse, if thou wert dead,

Since sleep, death's image, such fine talk hath bred?

#### 1.446. 443 Omne simile non est idem.

Together as we walk'd, a friend of mine,

Mistook a painted Madam for a signe

That in a window stood; but I acquainted,

Told him it was no woodden signe was painted,

But Madam—yea true said he,

Yet 'tis little signe of modesty.

#### 1.447. 444 Qui ebrius laudat temperantiam.

Severus likes not these unseason'd lines,

Of rude absurdities, times foul abuse,

To all posterities, and their assignes,

That might have bin, saith he, to better use.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=83) What

#### 1.448. 445 On Misus.

Wise-men are wiser than good-men, what then?

'Tis better to be wiser than wise men.

#### 1.450. 447 On Ducus.

Ducus keeps house, and it with reason stands,

That he keep house, hath sold away his lands,

#### 1.451. 448 On Mysus, and Mopsus.

Mysus and Mopsa hardly could agree,

Striving about superiority:

The Text which saith that man and wife are one,

Was the chief argument they stood upon.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=84) She held,
they both one woman should become:

He held, they should be man, and both but one.

So they contended dayly, but the strife;

Could not be ended, till both were one wife.

#### 1.452. 448 On Photinus.

I met Photynus at the B. Court,

Cited (as he said) by a knave relator:

I ask'd him wherefore? he in laughing sort,

Told me it was but for a childish matter.

How ere he laught it out, he lied not:

Indee d'twas childish, for the child he got.

#### 1.453. 449 On Ca [...]triotes.

See, see, what love is now betwixt each fist,

Ominus wondreth, since he came from Wales,

What the description of this Isle might be;

That ne're had seen but mountains, hils, and dales,

Yet would he boast, and stand on's pedegree.

From Rice ap Ric [...]ard, sprung from Dick a Cow,

Be cod was right good gentle-man, look ye now?

#### 1.456. 452 On T [...]irsites.

Although Thirsites have a filthy facae,

And staring eyes, and little outward grace:

Yet this he hath, to make amends for all,

Nature h [...]r selfe, is not more naturall.

#### 1.457. 453 On Zoylus.

If Souldiers may obtain four Termes of war,

Muskets should be the pleaders, Pikes the bar:

For black bags, Bandeleirs, Jackets for gownes,

Angels for fees; we'll take no more crack't crowns.

#### 1.458. 454 On a swearing Gallant.

What God cōmands, this wretched creature loathes,

He never names his Maker, but by oathes:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=85) And weares
his tongue, of such a damned fashion,

That swearing is his only recreation.

In morning, even assoon as he doth rise,

He swears his sleep is scarcely out of's eyes;

Then makes him ready, swearing all the while,

The drowzy weather did him much beguile.

Got ready, he, to dice or tables goes,

Swearing an oath, at every cast he throws:

To dinner next, and then in stead of Grace,

He swears his stomack is in hungry case.

No sooner din'd, but calls, come take away,

And swears 'tis late, he must goe see a Play.

There sits, and swears, to all he hears and see's,

This speech is good, that action disagrees.

So takes his Oa [...]es, and swears he must make hast,

His houre of Supper-time is almost past.

#### 1.459. 455 On a long Beard.

Thy Beard is long, better it would thee  [...]it,

To have a shorter Be [...]rd, and longer wit.

#### 1.460. 456 On my Selfe.

Who seeks to please all men each way,

And not himselfe offend;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=85) He may begin
to work to day,

But God knows when hee'l end.

#### 1.461. 457 To the mis-interperter.

Cease gaul'd backt guilt, those inscious lines to mince,

The world wil know y'are rubd if once you wince

They hem within their  [...]eeming Critique wall,

Particularly none, generally all:

'Mongst which if you have chanc'd to catch a prick

Cry we-hy if you will, but do not kick▪

#### 1.462. 458 On a Mother and her son having but two eyes betwixt the [...],
each one.

A half blind-boy, born of a half blind mother,

Peerlesse for beauty, save compar'd to th' other;

Faire boy, give her thine eye and she will prove

The Queen of beauty, thou the God of love.

#### 1.463. 459 To his quill.

Thou hast been wanton, therefore it is meet,

Thou 'shouldst do penance do it in a sheet.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=86)

#### 1.464. 460 Of C [...]irst crucified.

When red the Sun goes down, we use to say

It is a signe, we shall have a faire day:

Blood red the Sun of Heaven went down from hence

And we have had faire weather ever since.

#### 1.465. 461 On himselfe.

Mirth pleaseth some, to others 'tis offen [...]e,

Some cōmend plain conceits, some profound sence

Some wish a witty jest, some dislike that,

And most would have themselves they know not what

Then he that would plea [...]e all, and himselfe too,

Takes more in hand than he is like to doe.

#### 1.466. 462 To young men.

Yong men fly, when beauty darts

Amorous glances at your hearts,

The fixt marke gives your shooter aime,

And Ladyes lookes have power to maime,

Now 'twixt their lips, now in  [...]heir eyes

[...] a kisse or smile love lyes,

Then fly betimes for onely they

Conquer love that run away.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=86)

#### 1.467. 463 The pens prosopopeia to the Scrivener.

Thinike who when you cut the quill,

Wounded was yet did no ill;

When you mend me, thinke you must

Mend your selfe, else you're unjust

When you dip my nib in Inke,

Thinke on him that gall did drinke,

When the Inke sheds from your pen,

Thinke who shed his blood for men;

When you write, but thinke on this,

And you ne're shall write amisse.

#### 1.468. 464 A raritie.

If thou bee'st born to strange sights,

Things invisible to see:

Ride ten thousand dayes and nights,

Till age snow white haires on thee.

And thou when thou return'st wilt tell me;

All strange wonders that befell thee,

And thou 'lt sweare that no where

Lives a maiden true and faire.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=87)

#### 1.469. 465 Vpon Tom Tolt [...]am's nose.

The radiant colour of Tom Toltham's nose,

Puts down the lilly and obscures the rose;

Had I a jewell of such pretious hew,

I would present it to some Monarch's view,

No subject should possesse such jems as those

Ergo, the King must have Tom Toltham's nose.

#### 1.470. 466 Vpon Thorough-good an unthrif [...].

Thy sir name Thorough-good befitteth thee,

Thou T [...]orough-good, and good goes thorough thee

Nor thou in good, nor good in thee doth stay,

Both of you, thorough goe, and passe away.

#### 1.471. 467 In Amorem.

Love, if a God thou art, then evermore thou must

Be mercifull and just,

If just thou be, O wherefore doth thy dart,

Wound mine alone, and not my Mistrisse heart?

If mercifull, then why am I to paine reserv'd,

Who have the truly serv'd?

Whiles she that for thy power cares not a fly,

[...]aughs thee to scorn, and lives at liberty:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=87) Then if a
God thou wilt accounted be

Heale me like her, or else wound her like me.

#### 1.472. 468 Ariddle on a pound of candles.

One evening as cold as cold might bee,

With frost and snow, and pinching weather,

Companions about three times three,

Lay close all in a bed together;

Yet one after other they took [...] a heat,

And dy'd that night all in a sweat.

#### 1.473. 469 On the new aressings.

Ladyes that weare black cypresse vailes,

Turn'd lately to white linnen railes,

And to your girdle weare your bands;

And shew your armes in stead of hands:

What can you do in Lent more meet,

As fittest dresse, than weare a sheet:

'Twas once a band, tis now a cloake,

An acorne one day proves an oake,

Weare but your lawn unto your feet,

And then your band will prove a sheet:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=88) By which
device and wise excesse,

You do your pennance in a dresse,

And none shall know, by what they see,

Which Lady's censur'd, which goes free.

#### 1.474. 469 T [...]us answered.

Blacke Cypresse vailes are shrouds of night,

White linnen railes are railes of light;

Which though we to our girdles weare,

W'have hands to keepe your armes off there;

Who makes our bands to be a cloake,

Makes Iohn a Stiles of Iohn an Oke:

We weare our linnen to our feet,

Yet need not make our band a sheet.

Your Clergie wears as long as wee,

Yet that implyes conformitie:

Be wise, recant what you have writ,

Least you do pennance for your wit:

Love charmes have power to weave a string

Shall tye you, as you ty'd your ring,

Thus by loves sharpe, but just decree

You may be censur'd, we go free.

#### 1.475. 470 Amicitia.

What's  [...]riendship? 'tis a treasure,

'tis a pleasure:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=88) Bred 'twixt
two worthy spirits,

by their merits:

'Tis two  [...]inds in one, meeting

never fleeting:

Two wils in one consenting,

each contenting,

One brest in two divided, yet not parted;

A double body, and yet single hearted;

Two bodies making one, through self election,

Two minds, yet having both but one affection.

#### 1.476. 471▪ To his Mistrisse.

I cannot pray you in a studied stile,

Nor speak words distant from my heart a mile;

I cannot visit Hide-parke every day,

And with a hackney court my time away;

I cannot spanniolize it weeke by week,

Or waite a moneth to kisse your hand or cheek;

If when you'r lov'd you cannot love againe,

Why doe but say so, I am out of paine.

#### 1.477. 472 On the Queene of Bohemia.

You meaner Beauties of the night,

Which poorely satisfie our eyes;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=89) More by your
number then your light;

The common people of the skies:

What are ye when the moon shall rise?

You violets that first appeare,

By your purple mantle known;

Like proud virgins of the yeere,

As if the Spring were all your own;

What are you when the rose is blown?

You wandring chaunters of the wood,

That fill the ayre with natures layes:

Thinking your passions understood,

By weak accents, where's your praise,

When Philomell her voyce shall raise:

So when my Princesse shall be seen,

In sweetnes of her lookes and mind:

By vertues first, then choyce a Queen,

Tell me, was she not design'd,

Th' eclipse and glory of her kind?

#### 1.478. 473 To his noble friend.

There's no necessity that can exclude

The poorest being from a gratitude;

For when the strength of fortune lends no more,

He that is truely thankefull is not poore,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=89) Yours be the
bounty then, mine the great debt,

On which no time, nor power can ransome set.

#### 1.479. 474 Fatum Supremum.

All buildings are but monuments of death,

All clothes but winding sheets for our last knell,

All dainty fattings for the worms beneath,

All curious musique, but our passing bell;

Thus death is nobly waited on, for why?

All that we have is but deaths livery.

#### 1.480. 475 On his Mrs. death

Unjustly we complain of fate,

For short'ning our unhappy dayes,

When death doth nothing but translate

And print  [...]s in a better phrase;

Yet who can choose but weep? not I,

That beautie of such excellence,

And more vertue then could dy;

By deaths rude hand is ravish'd hence,

Sleepe blest creature in thine Urne,

My sighes, my teares shall not awake thee,

I but stay untill my turne

And then, Oh then! I'le overtake thee.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=90)

#### 1.481. 476 Aequè facilitas ac difficultas nocet amoris.

I love not her that at the first cries I,

I love not her that doth me still deny,

Be she too hard shee'll cause me to despaire,

Be she too easie, shee's as light as faire;

'Tis hard to say whether most hurt procure,

She that is hard or easy to allure,

If it be so, then lay me by my side

The hard, soft, willing and unwilling bride.

#### 1.482. 477 In monumenta Westminsteriensia.

Mortality behold and feare,

What a change of flesh is here;

Thinke how many royall bones,

Sleep within this heap of stones,

Here they ly, had realmes and lands;

Who now want strength to stir their hands;

Where from their Pulpits seel'd with dust,

They preach, In greatnes is no trust;

Here's an acre sown indeed,

With the richest royal'st seed,

That the earth did e're suck in

Since the first man dy'd for sin,

Here the bones of birth have cry'd,

Though Gods they were, as men they dy'd:

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=90) Here are
sands, ignoble things,

Drop'd from the ruin'd sides of Kings;

Here's a world of pompe and state,

Buried in dust, once dead by fate.

#### 1.483. 478 Semel it sa [...]ivimus.

Beldam, God blesse thee, thou want'st nought but wit

And having gotten that, we'r freed from it,

Bridewell, I cannot any way dispraise thee

For thou dost feed the poore and jerke the lazie.

New-gate, of thee I cannot much complaine;

For once a moneth, thou freest men out of paine,

But from the Counters gracious Lord defend us:

To Bedlam, Bridewell, or to New gate send us,

For there in time wit, worke, or law sets free;

But here wit, work, nor law gets liberty.

#### 1.484. 479 On the Marriage of one Turbolt, with Mrs. Hill.

What are Deucalions dayes return'd that we,

A Turbolt swimming on a Hill do see?

What shall we in this age so strange report,

That fishes leave the sea on hils to sport?

And yet this hill, though never tir'd with standing

Lay gently down to give a Turbolt landing.

Love hath no tree, but that whose bark is smock.

But Devonshire lately liv'd in rich estate,

Till Rich his toyes did Devonshire so bewitch,

As Devonshire dy'd and left the Devill rich.

#### 1.488. 483 On Cupid.

Why feign they Cupid robbed of sight;

Can he whose seat is in the eye, want light?

#### 1.489. 484 A [...] answer.

Experience shews, and reason doth decree

That he who sits in's owne light cannot see.

#### 1.490. 485 Barten Holiday to the Puritan on his Technogamia.

'Tis not my person, nor my play,

But my sirname, Holiday,

That does offend thee, thy complaints

Are not against me, but the Saints;

So ill dost thou endure my name,

Because the Church doth like the same,

A name more awfull to the puritane

Then Talbo [...] unto france, or Drake to Spaine▪

#### 1.491. 486 On a Picture.

This face here pictur'd time shall longer have,

Then life the substance of it, or the grave,

Yet as I change from this by death I know,

I shall like death, the liker death I grow.

#### 1.492. 487 In Meretrices.

The law hangs theeves for their unlawfull stealing,

The law carts bawds for keeping of the doore,

The law doth punish rogues, for roguish dealing,

The law whips both the pander and the whore;

But yet I muse from whence this law is grown;

Whores must not steal, yet must not use their own.

#### 1.493. 487 On the Citty Venice.

When in the Adriatick Neptune saw

How Venice stood, and gave the seas their law,

Boast thy Tarpeian towers, now Iove said he,

And Mars thy wals, if Tiber 'fore the sea

Thou dost prefer, view both the cities ods,

Thou'l [...] say that men built Rome, Venice, the gods.

#### 1.494. 488 To a Lady that every morning used to paint her fa [...]e.

Preserve what nature gave you, nought's more base,

Th [...]n Belgian colour on a Roman face,

Much good time's lost, you rest your faces debtor,

And make it worse, striving to make it better.

#### 1.495. 489 On a Cuckold.

My friend did tax me seriously one morne,

That I would weare, yet could not winde a horne

And I reply'd he perfect truth should find it,

Many did weare the horn that could not wind it,

Howe're of all that man may weare it best,

Who makes claime to it as his ancient crest.

#### 1.496. 490 Vpon Marriage.

Marriage as old men note, hath likened bin

Unto a publiq [...]e feast or common route,

Where those that are without, would fain get in,

And those that are within would faine get out.

#### 1.497. 491 Quicquid non nummus.

The mony'd man can safely saile all seas,

And make his fortune as himselfe shall please,

He can wed Danae, and command that now

Acrisius selfe that fatall match allow:

He can declaime, chide, censure verses, write,

And do all things better then Cato might;

He knows the Law and rules it, hath and is

Whole Servius, and what Labeo can possesse,

In briefe let rich men wish what e're they love,

'Twill come, they in a lock'd chest keep a Iove.

#### 1.498. 492 On Annas a news-monger.

Thus have I waded through a worthlesse taske,

Whereto I trust there's no exception ta'ne,

For meant to none, I answer such as aske,

'Tis like apparell made in birchen lane;

If any please to suit themselves and weare it,

The blames not mine but theirs that needs will weare it.

#### 1.500. 495 To Aulus.

Some (speaking in their own renown)

Say that this book, was not exactly done;

I care not much, like banquets, let my bookes

Rather be pleasing to the guests then cooks.

#### 1.501. 496 Ad sesquipedales poetastros.

Hence Brauron's God to Tauriminion,

And you Levaltoring Corybants be gone;

Fly thundring Bronsterops to Hippocrene,

Thou vanquisher of Spanish Geryon,

Stout Asdruball Sicilian Lord of yore,

Thou that destroyd'st the Calidonian bore;

Couragious conqueror of Creetes Minotaure,

Thou pride of Mermeros' cloudy Semitaure.

And pass't the quicke sands of Semplegades,

Helpe Demogorgon, King of heaven and earth,

The world with child looks for delivery

Of Cannibals or Poetophagie;

A devillish brood, from Ericthonius,

From Iphidemia, Nox, and Erebus,

Chide Pegasus for op'ning Helicon,

And Poets damn to Pery-Phlegeton,

Or make this monstrous birth abortive be

Or else I will shake hands with poetrie.

#### 1.502. 497 A Serving man.

One to a Serving man this councell sent,

Yet he would understand he's in his debt.

#### 1.503. 498 Two Theeves.

Goe home again, we are not yet asleep.

A poore man being sent for to the King,

Began to covet much a certaine thing

Before he went: being but an Iron naile,

His friend did aske him what it would availe?

this is as good as one of steele,

For me to knock now into fortunes wheele.

#### 1.506. 501 Three Pages.

Three Pages on a time together met,

And made a motion, that each one would let

The other know what hee'd desire to be

Having his wish, thereto they did agree.

Quoth one, to be a Melon I would chuse,

For then I'm sure, none would refuse

To kisse my breech although the sent were hot,

And so they'd know whether I were good or not.

#### 1.507. 502 A Gentleman and his Phisitian.

A Gentleman not richest in discretion,

Was alwayes sending for his own phisition.

And on a time he needs would of him know,

What was the cause his pulse did go so slow?

Why (quoth the Doctor) thus it comes to passe,

Must needs go slow, which goes upon an asse.

#### 1.508. 503 A Peasant and his wife.

A Peasant with his wife was almost wilde,

To understand his Daughter was with childe,

And said if to the girle sh'ad taken heed,

### 2\. EPITAPHS.

#### 2.1. 1\. On a travelling begger.

HEre lies a Vagrant person whom our lawes,

(Of late growne strict) denied passage, cause

Hee wandred thus, therefore returne he must,

From whence at first he hither came, to dust.

#### 2.2. 2\. On a Mason.

So long the Mason wrought on other's walles,

That his owne house of clay to ruine falles:

No wonder spitefull death, wrought his annoy,

He us'd to build, and death seekes to destroy.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=98)

#### 2.3. 3\. On a Dyer.

Though death the Dyer colour-lesse hath made,

Yet he dies pale, and will not leave his trade;

But being dead, the meanes yet doth not lacke

To die his friends cloth into mourning blacke.

Some sure foresaw his death, for they of late

Vs'd to exclaime upon his dying fate.

And weake, and faint, he seem'd oft-times t'have been,

For to change colours, often he was seen;

Yet there no matter was so foule, but he

Would set a colour on it handsomlye.

Death him no unexpected stroke could give

That learnt to dye, since he began to live.

He shall yet prove, what he before hath try'd,

And shall once more, live after he hath dy'd.

#### 2.4. 4\. Of a Schoolemaster.

The grāmer Schoole a long time taught I have,

Yet all my skill could not decline the grave,

In no case save the Ablative alone.

Renowned Spencer lye a thought more nigh

To learned Chaucer, and rare Beaumont lye

A little neerer Spencer, to make roome

For Shake-speare in your threefold, fourefold tombe

To lodge all foure in one bed make a shift

Vntill Doomes d [...]y, for hardly will a fifth

Betwixt this day and that by Fates be slaine▪

For whom your curtaines may be drawn againe.

If your precedencie in death doe barre

A fourth place in your sacred Sepulchre;

Vnder this sacred marble of thine owne,

Sleepe rare Tragaedian Shake-speare! sleep alone.

Thy unmolested peace in an unshared cave

Possesse as Lord, not tenant of thy grave.

That unto us, and others it may bee

Honour hereafter to be laid by thee.

#### 2.6. 6\. On a youth.

Now thou hast Heaven for merit, but 'tis strange

Mortality should  [...]nvie at thy change:

But God thought us unfit, for such as thee,

And made thee consort of eternitye.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=99) We grieve
not then, that thou to heaven art takē

But that thou hast thy friends so soone forsaken▪

#### 2.7. 7\. On Prince Henry.

I have no veine in verse, but if I could,

Distill on every word a pearle I would.

Our sorrowes pearles drop not from pens, but eies,

Whilst other's Muse? write, mine onely cries.

#### 2.8. 8\. On a Foot-boy that dyed with overmuch running.

Base tyrant death thus to assaile one tyr'd

Who scarse his latest breath beeing left expir'd;

And being too too cruell thus to stay

So swift a course, at length ran quite away.

But pretty boy, be sure it was not death

That left behind thy body out of breath:

Thy soule and body running in a race,

Thy soule held out; thy body tyr'd apace,

Thy soule gained, and left that lump of clay

To rest it selfe, untill the latter day.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=99)

#### 2.9. 9\. On Hobson the Carrier.

Hobson, (what's out of sight is out of mind)

Is gone, and left his letters here behind.

He that with so much paper us'd to meet;

Is now, alas! content to take one sheet.

#### 2.10. 10\. Another.

He that such carriage store, was wont to have,

Is carried now himselfe unto his grave:

O strange! he that in life ne're made but one,

Six Carriers makes, now he is dead and gone.

#### 2.11. 11\. Another.

Here Hobson lyes, prest with a heavy loade,

Who now is gone the old and common Roade;

The waggon he so lov'd, so lov'd to ride,

That he was drawing on, whilst that he dy'd.

#### 2.12. 12\. Another.

Hobson [...]s not dead but Charles the Northerne swaine

Hath sent for him, to draw his lightsome-waine.

Behold here lyes a scalded pate quite bare▪

In catching conies, who lost many a hare.

#### 2.14. 14\. On a faire Damosell.

Life is the Road to death, & death Heavens gate must be,

Heaven is the throne of Christ, & Christ is life to me.

#### 2.15. 15\. On a Foot-man.

This nimble foot-man ran away from death,

And here he rested being out of breath;

Here death him overtooke, made him his slave,

And sent him on an errand to his grave.

#### 2.16. 16\. On Queene Anne,  [...] dyed in March, was kept all Aprill, and
buried in May.

March with his winds hath strucke a Cedar tall,

And weeping April mournes the Cedar's fall;

And May intēds her month no flow'rs shal bring

Since she must lose, the flow'r of all the spring.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=100) Thy March
his winds have caused April show'rs

And yet sad May must lose his flow'r of flow'rs.

#### 2.17. 17\. Iustus Lipsius.

Some have high mountaines of Parian stone,

And some in brasse carve their inscription,

Some have their tombes of costly marble rea [...]'d,

But in our teares, onely art thou interr'd.

#### 2.18. 18\. On a child of two yeeres old, being borne and dying in Iuly.

Here is laid a July-flow'r

With surviving teares bedew'd

Not despayring of that houre

When her spring shall be renew'd;

E're she had her Summer seene,

Shee was gather'd, fresh and greene.

#### 2.19. 29\. Another.

Like bird of prey,

Death snatcht away,

harmelesse dove,

Whose soule so pure

Is now secure

In heaven above.

That flesh is grasse

It's grace a flower

Reade e're you passe

Whom wormes dovour [...].

#### 2.21. 21\. On a Cobler.

Death at a Coblers doore oft made a stand,

And alwaies found him on the mending hand;

At last came death in very foule weather,

And ript the soale, from the upper leather:

Death put a trick upon him, and what was't?

The cobler call'd for's awle, death brought his Laste.

#### 2.22. 22\. On a Lock-smith.

A zealous Lock-smith dy'd of late,

Who by this time's at heaven-gate

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=101) The reason
why he will not knocke

Is, 'cause he meanes to picke the locke.

#### 2.23. 23\. On a Collier.

Here lies the Collier Jenkin Dashes,

By whom death nothing gain'd he swore,

For living he was dust and ashes:

And being dead, he is no more.

#### 2.24. 24\. On Dick Pinner.

Here lyes Dick Pinner, O ungentle death!

Why did'st thou rob Dick Pinner of his breath?

For living, he by scraping of a pin

Made better dust, then thou hast made of him.

#### 2.25. 25\. On M. Thomas Best.

With happie stars he sure is blest,

Where  [...] ere he goes, that still is Best.

Cùm illo jacet illa, quae communis in villâ

And that very mal [...],

Her name was Nan, who lou'd well a man,

So gentlemen vale.

#### 2.32. 32\. On a Sack-sucker.

#### 2.35. 35\. On Iohn Death.

Here's Death intterred, that liu'd by bread,

Then all should live, now death is dead.

#### 2.36. 36\. On a Scrivener.

Here to a period, is the Scrievener come,

This is the last sheet, his full point this tombe.

Of all aspersions I excuse him not,

'Tis knowne he liu'd not, without many a blot;

Yet he no ill example shew'd to any,

But rather gave good coppies unto many:

He in good letters alwaies hath beene bred

And hath writ more, then many men have read.

He rulers had as his command by law,

And though he could not hang, yet he could draw.

He far more bond men had & made than any,

A dash alone of his pen ruin'd many.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=103) That not
without good reason, we might call

Hi [...] letters great or little Capitall:

Yet is the Scriveners fate as sure as just,

When he hath all done, then he falls to dust.

#### 2.37. 37\. On a Chandler.

How might his dayes end that made weekes? or hee

That could make light, here laid in darkenes bee?

Yet since his weekes were spent how could he chose

But be depriu'd of light & his trade lose▪

Yet dead the Chandler is, and sleep's in peace,

No wonder! long since melted was his greace:

It seemes that he did evill, for daylight

He hated, and did rather wish the night,

Yet came his workes to light, & were like gold

Prou'd in the fire, but could not tryall hold.

His candle had an end, and death's black night

Is an extinguisher of all his light.

#### 2.38. 38\. On a young gentle-woman.

Nature in this small volume was about

To perfect what in women was left out;

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=104) Yet
carefull least a peice so well begun

Should want preservatives when she had done:

E're she could finish, what she undertooke,

Threw dust upon it, and shut up the booke.

#### 2.39. 39\. On an Infant.

The reeling world turn'd poet, made a play,

I came to see't, dislik't it, w [...]nt my way.

He first deceased, she a little try'd

To live without him, liked not, and dy'd.

#### 2.41. 41\. On a Smith.

Farewell stout Iron-side, not all thine art

Could make a shield against death's envious dart.

Without a fault no man, his life doth passe,

For to his vice the Smith addicted was.

He oft, (as choller is encreas't by fire)

Was in a  [...]ume, and much enclin'd to ire.

He had so long bin us'd to forge, that he

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=104) Was with a
blacke coale markt for forgery

But he for witnesse needed not to care,

Who but a blacke-smith was, though ne [...]'e so fayre.

And opertunities he slacked not

That knew to strike, then when the [...]ir'n was hot

As the doore-nailes he made, hee's now as dead,

He them, & death him, hath knockt on the head.

#### 2.42. 42\. On Mr. Stone.

Jerusalems curse is not fulfill'd in mee,

For here a stone upon a stone you see.

#### 2.43. 43\. On a Child.

Into this world as stranger to an Inne

This child came guest-wise, where when it had beene

A while and f [...]und nought worthy of his stay,

He onely broke his fast & went away.

#### 2.44. 44\. On a man drown'd in the snow.

Within a fleece of silent waters drown'd;

Before my death was knowne a grave I found.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=109)That which
exil'd my life from her sweet home,

For griefe straight froz it selfe into a tombe.

One element my angry fate thought meet

To be my death, grave, tombe, & winding-sheet,

Phaebus himselfe mine Epitaph had writ,

But blotting many e're he thought one fit;

He wrote untill my grave, and tombe were gone,

And  [...]twas an Epitaph that I had none;

For every one that passed by that way,

Without a sculpture read that there  [...] lay;

Here now the second time untomb'd I lye,

And thus much have the best of Destinie:

Corruption from which onely one was free,

Devour'd my grave but did not feede on mee:

My first grave tooke me from the  [...]ace of men,

My last shall give me backe to life agen.

#### 2.45. 45\. On Prince Henry.

In natur's law 'tis a plaine case to dye,

No cunning Lawyer can demurre on that;

For cruell death and destiny,

Serve all men with a Latitat.

So Princely Henry; when his case was try'd,

Confess'd the action, paid the debt, and dy'd.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=109)

Here lyes one Strange, no Pagan, Turke, nor Jew

It's strange, but not so strange as it is true.

#### 2.47. 47\. On a Scholler.

Forbeare friend t' unclaspe this booke

Onely in the fore-front looke,

For in it have errours bin,

Which made th' authour call it in:

Yet know this, 't shall have more worth,

At the second comming forth.

#### 2.48. 48\. On a young woman.

The body which within this earth is laid,

Twice sixe weekes knew a wife, a saint, a maid;

Here Br [...]wne the quondam begger lyes▪

Who counted by his tale,

He had beene still alive.

And with it a fire-coale.

But losing that, now bids good-night.

Thy conquest grave, where is thy sting?

Where harbour'd was with me all filthy kind of sin;

Into eternall joy by faith to enter in.

Why weepe you then my friends, my parents & my kin

Lament ye whē I lose, but weep not when I win

Alas here's naught, but his old rotten maile.

Her went a good-while since, no question store

Are glad, who vext he would not goe before:

And some are grieu'd hee's gone so soone away,

The Lord knowes why he did no longer stay.

How could he please you all? I'm sure of this,

He linger'd soundly howsoe're you misse.

But gone he is, nor was he surely well

At his departure as mischance befell,

For he is gone in such unwonted kinde

As ne're before, his goods all left behinde.

Whose friends & kinsmen mightie Princes are

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=112)For though
they run the race of men and dye,

Death serves but to refine their majesty.

So did the Queen from hence her court remove,

And left the earth to be enthron'd above.

Thus is she chang'd not dead, no good Prince dyes

But like the day-star, onely sets to rise.

But then came Hercules with his club,

And struck him downe to Belzebub.

#### 2.63. 63\. On an onely child.

A Taylour is a thiefe, a Sergeant is worse

Who here lyes dead, god-a-mercy horse.

#### 2.72. 71\. On Sir Francis Drake, drowned.

Where Drake first found, there last he lost his fame

For who can say, here lies Sir Francis Drake?

had so rarely wrought

That Pallas it admir'd and thought,

No greater jewell, than to weare

Still such a diamond in her eare:

But sicknesse did it from her wring,

And placed it in Libitina's ring,

Who changed natures worke a new

And death's pale image, in it drew▪

Pitty that paine had not been sav'd▪

So good a stone to be engrav'd.

That death should thus from hence our Butler

Into my minde it cannot quickly sinke,

Sure death came thirsty to the butt'ry-hatch catch

When he (that buisy'd was) deny'd him drinke.

And death made drunke, him made away the quicker

Yet let not others grieve to much in mind

(The Butlers gone) the key's are left behind.

#### 2.87. 87\. On a Souldier.

From whence he rid to London day by day,

Till death benighting him, he lo [...]t his way,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=118) His teame

Part of himselfe interr'd, that soone bereft

The Mother of the gift, she gave, life; so

'Twas strange, that the child blindfold espi'd

So quick and neere a way to parricide▪

Yet both are justly question'd, child and Mothe [...]

Are guilty of the killing of each other.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=123) Not with an
ill intent, both did desire

Preserves for life, and not a funerall fire;

And yet they needs must dye, & 'twas thought best

To keepe the infant in the mother's chest;

It had both life and death from her, the wombe

In which it was begot, became the tombe;

There was some marble sav'd, because in her

The wombe that bare it, was a sepulcher;

Whose Epitaphs are these,-here lyes a child that shall

Be free from all sins but originall.

Here lyes a pittied mother that did dye

Onely to beare her poore child companie.

His play, the dice are throwne, when first he drink's

Cast's, makes a blott, death hits him with a Synke

He cast's againe, but all in vaine, for death

Fare-well stout hott-spur, now the battail's done

In which th' art foyi'd, & death hath over-come

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=125) Having o
're-matcht thy strength, & made thee stoop

She quickly forct thee on the pit to droop

From whence thou art not able, rise or stir:

For death is now become, thy vanquisher.

#### 2.124. 123▪ On a pious benefactour.

The poore, the world, the heavens, & the grave

His almes, his praise, his soule, and body have.

#### 2.125. 124\. Vpon Hodge Pue's Father.

Oh cruell death that stopt the view;

Of Thom's parishioner good-man Pue,

Who lived alwaies in good order,

Vntill that death stopt his recorder,

Which was betwixt Easter and Penticost,

In the yeare of the great frost,

At New-market then was the King:

When as the bells did merrily ring;

The Minister preached the day before

Vnto his highnesse, and no more,

Returning home said prayers, and

Bnried the man as I understand.

#### 2.126. 125\. On M. Washington, page to the Prince.

Knew'st thou whose these ashes were;

Reader thou would'st weeping sweare,

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=125)The rash
fate er [...]'d here; as appeares,

Counting his vertues for his yeares,

His goodnesse made them so o're seene,

Which shew'd him threescore;at eighteene.

Enquire not his disease or paine!

He dy'd of nothing else but spayne,

Where the worst calenture he feeles,

Are Jesuites, and Alguaziles,

Where he is not allow'd to have,

(Vnlesse he steal't) a quiet grave.

Hee needes no other Epitaph or stone

But this, here lyes lov'd Washington,

Write this in teares, in that loose dust

And every greiv'd beholder must,

When he waigh [...]s him, and knowes his yeares▪

Renew the let [...]ers with his teares.

#### 2.127. 126\. On Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden.

The world expects Swede's monumentall stone,

Should equall the Philosophers, each groane

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=126) Should
breath a golden veine, and ev'ry verse

Should draw Elixar from his fatall hearse.

No fitter subject where strong lines should meet

Than such a noble center; could the feet

Of able verse but trace his rectories,

They neede not feare o're strayn'd Hyperbole's,

Where all's transoendent, who out-paralell'd

Plutarch's selected Heroes; and is held

The tenth of Worthies, who hath over-acted

Great Caesar's German-comments, & contracted

His expeditions by preventing awe,

He often over-came before hee saw;

And (what of his great sonne Jove us'd to say)

Hee alwaies either found or made his way.

Such was his personall and single fight,

As if that death it selfe had ta'ne her flight

Into brave Swedens scabbard, when he drew;

Death with that steele inevitably flew;

His campe a church, wherein the Gen'rall's life

Was the best Sermon, and the onely strife

'Amongst his was to repeate it, bended knee

Was his prime posture, and his  [...]nemy

Found this most praevalent, his discipline

Impartiall and exact, it did out-shine

Those antique Martiall-Graecian, Roman lamps

From Wch most of the worlds succeeding camps

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=126) Have had
their borrow'd light; this, this was hee

All this and more, yet even all this can dye.

Death surely ventur'd on the Swede' to try

If heav'n were subject to mortality;

And shot his soule to heav'n, as if that shee

Could (if not kill) unthrone a diety

Bold death's deceiv'd, 'tis in another sense

That heav'n is said to suffer violence.

No yr'n chaine-shot, but 'tis the golden chaine

Of vertue and the Graces, are the maine

That doe unhinge the everlasting gates

All which like yoaked undivided mates,

Were linck't in Sweden, where they were en­chain'd

Like Orthodoxall volumes nothing feign'd,

Though fairely bound his story is not dipt

In oyle,  [...]ut in his owne true Manuscript.

It is enough to name him, surely wee

Have got that Roman's doating Lethargy

And may our names forget, if so we can

Forget the name of Sweden; renown [...]d man!

Thon hadst no sooner made the Worthies ten

But heavē did claime the tenth; zealous that men

Would idolize thee, but their inst [...]ment.

Thus thy Meridian prov'd thy Occiden.

Had longer dayes beene graunted by the fates,

Rome had heard this Hanniball at her gates

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=20950&page=127) Farewell
thou Austrian scourge,

thou moderne wonder,

Srange raine hath followed

thy last clap of thunder,

A shower of teares:

and yet for ought we know,

The Horne that's left.

may blow downe Jericho.

FINIS.
