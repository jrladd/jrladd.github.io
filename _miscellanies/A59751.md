### 1.1. SALMACIS

BY Signeur GIROLAMO PRETI, Out of Italian.

WHere cleer Pactolus glides through Phrygian Lands

Tween Banks of Emeralds, on golden Sands,

And in his Courſe does Lydi [...]'s Confines trace

With humid feet, and with a ſlippery pace,

The Bed-rid Earth, to eaſe her ſelf (oppreſt

With her own weight, and crampt with her long Reſt)

Her vaſter Limbs firſt ſtretches to a Plain,

Then to a Mountain lifts her head again;

A Mountain; ſuch for height, as if 'midſt thoſe

Which to ſcale Heaven by the bold Giants choſe

(Pelion, Olympus, Oſſa,) plac'd it were,

Would like a Cedar 'mongſt low ſhrubs appear.

So far above the Clouds his head doth riſe

That his green Locks no Summer dripping ſpies

With Rain, his face no Winter does behold

Mask'd with a ſnowy Muffler 'gainſt the cold.

The proud Uſurper ſeems as if he meart,

[...]corning his low and baſer Element,

[[Page 2]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=4) To make the
Airy Region his own,

And plant for Juno an Imperiall Throne.

Or like ſome new Briareus he ſtands

Arm'd with more large-ſpred Oaks than he with hands,

And menaces the Stars; his Sides and Back,

Woods which ne'r ſhade, fields which ne'r verdure lack,

With a green Mantle cloath, whoſe fringed Baſe

A hundred Brooks with Streams of Silver Lace.

At foot of this tall Rock, a Cave diſclos'd

It ſelf; a Cave, ſhady and dark; ſuppos'd

The ſole deſign of Nature, as th' Effect,

Where She both Workman plaid, and Architect.

Over whoſe gaping Mouth, her hand had hewn

Out of the living Rock a Lip of Stone

Cut like a bending Arch; whence for more grace

(As 'twere the native Porter of the Place)

Green Ivy wreath'd in many a ſubtile knot

Hung dangling: Fore the entry of the Grot

With ſtreams of liquid Pearl, (the humid Son

Of ſome large Torrent) a ſmall Brook does run,

Which on the Pibbles as it purling plaies,

Does ſo harmonious a murmur raiſe,

Tun'd to ſo juſt a Pitch, as dares defie

The Birds ſweet Noats, and with the Lute may vie.

I'th' midd'ſt of this vaſt Cave, (which ſeems to prop

With it's arch'd back th' whole Mountain) tow'rd the top

Opens a ſpacious Vent; through which, it's flight,

The damp Air takes, Entrance, the Suns warm light.

The rude Walls Ivy, creeping round about,

With a green Suit of Tapp'ſtry hangs throughout.

The Goddeſs which in Heavens third Orb does ſhine

Did to theſe ſhades her amorous thefts confine.

Here her delights ſecur'd; whoſe Paſſions prove

Her more the Servant, than the Queen of Love,

[[Page 3]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=4) Here Mars
to war oft taught ſhe in Loves field

With other weapons than with Spear and Shield;

Whil'ſt 'bout his Sinewy Neck her Arms ſhe wound,

And his rough Limbs in thoſe ſoft Fetters bound.

Here once three naked Goddeſſes ('tis ſaid)

With cenſuring Eyes the Phrygian Swain ſurvayd;

Whoſe judgement in that memorable ſtrife

Gain'd him the beautious Hellen for his Wife,

And gave to lovely Ven [...]s uncontroll'd

The Prize of Beauty, and the fruit of Gold.

And here at laſt the winged Son of Jove

And M [...]ija, ſported with the Queen of Love;

Who, in theſe ſhades (if Fame have Truth reveal'd)

And her ſoft Boſome, long time lay conceal'd.

Mean while great Jove, wondring at his neglect,

(Who of ſome Meſſage did return expect)

Thus with himſelf diſcours'd 'bout his long ſtay:

Sure he lies lurking for ſome hop'd-for Prey,

Or his light Wings, (doubtleſs h'had elſe return'd:)

He in the Sea hath wet, or fire hath burn'd.

True Jove; he lurking lay, but in the ſhade

Of Venus Arms; whil'ſt on her Lips he preyd.

His Pinions he had ſing'd; but with Loves ſorch,

Which not ſo much his Plumes as heart did ſcorch;

Drench'd too he had, and wet his lighter Wing,

Not in the Seas ſalt Waves, but Loves ſweet ſpring.

And now ſeaven times the Sun with quickning Ray

Had lighted in the Eaſt the Lamp of day;

As oft the humid Night had wrapt the Skies

In her black Mantle, wrought with Stars like Eyes:

And yet no Day goes by, no Night e'r paſſes,

But ſees theſe Lovers link'd in cloſe Embraces.

But from thoſe Arms (where long a Pris'ner held)

The loyt'ring God now to return compell'd,

[[Page 4]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=5) Unwillingly
their dear Embrace declind:

Yet left a growing Pledge of Love behind.

Nine times already had the Moon (conſtrain'd

By Courſe) her Orbinto a Creſcent wain'd;

As oft, (her horns ſpred to a round) had run

With Light that ſeem'd to emulate the Sun;

VVhen a ſweet Boy (ſo geniall Stars diſpos'd)

Fair Cytheraea's pregnant VVomb diſclos'd.

In their warm Laps new born the Graces laid him,

And with their ſofter Arms a Cradle made him.

Beauty firſt ſuckled him at her white Breaſt

And her Idaea in his Looks impreſt.

About him did like little Anticks play,

Laughter, and mirth, and ſmil'd his Cries a [...]ay.

No noiſe, but light breath'd from his Lips of Roſes,

[...]ch as the Sky no Thunder heard diſcloſes,

Nor like to other Childrens, ſeem'd his Eyes

Two ſprings of Tears, but like two Suns to riſe:

VVhence all preſag'd that they in time ſhould prove

No leſs the Food than the ſweet fire of Love.

His Beauty with his years did ſtill increaſe;

VVhil'ſt his fair Mother, longing to impreſs

The Image of her ſelf in his lov'd face,

Did every day add ſome Celeſtiall Grace.

Now grown a Youth, behold him, with the Darts

Of his bright Eyes, ſubduing Female Hearts:

The living Picture of his Parents; where

Their mixed Beauties ſeem t'have equall ſhare.

From Father both and Mother Name he took,

From Father both and Mother his ſweet Look.

All the feign'd Beauties of the VVorld, ſeem'd met

In him as in their living Counterfeit.

VVhere Nature (like Apelles) the beſt Graces

(To add to his,) cull'd from a Thouſand Faces,

[[Page 5]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=5) Upon his
Ivory Front you might behold

His curled Treſſes flow like VVaves of Gold,

And as enamoured on his Lovely Face,

That with their ſoft and twining Arms embrace.

Then like looſe VVantons 'bout his Neck to twiſt,

Glad that they might by its warm ſnow be kiſt.

View his fair Front, and thoul't ſay that diſplays

A clear Horizon deckt with Morning Rayes;

And as we ſee beneath the dawning Gleams

O'th' Morn, the Sun ſhoot forth his brighter Beams;

So here might you perceive alike to riſe

In's Front the Morn, the Sun in his bright Eyes.

His melting Lips, Speeches Vermilion Gate,

Soft Seat of ſmiles, bluſhes ſo ſweet dilate,

As ſeem at once to raviſh the pleas'd ſight,

And to a Kiſs the longing touch invite;

Through which a fragrant Zephyrus tranſpires,

That Fans and kindles both Loves flagrant Fires.

Nor can one tell (no grace in either miſſing)

VVhich beſt becomes them, ſpeaking, ſmiling, kiſſing.

Look on his tender Cheek, and the [...]e thoul't ſpy

The Roſe as in a Throne of Majeſty,

'Midd'ſt a white Guard of Lillies, proudly grow;

Or bluſhing Pinks ſet in a Bank of Snow:

His Habit, and his Looks did both expreſs

A kind of ſweet becomming careleſneſs.

VVhom all ſo much more Beautifull eſteem

By how much he leſs beautifull would ſeem.

VVhil'ſt thus he manifeſts in every Part,

What Art there is in Beauty void of Art.

One Day by Chance 'twixt him and Cupid grew

This aemulous Conteſt; which of them Two

(Since he in Beauty ſo ſurpaſt the other)

The God of Love ſhould be! he, or his Brother?

[[Page 6]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=6) When Venus
Arbitreſs of the Debate

On a Sublime Tribunal thron'd in State,

(Fixing upon the Lovely youth her Eyes)

Thus ſpake: My Deer, this Doom 'twixt you denies

All further ſtrife; a Bow Cupid and thou

Shalt bear; he at his ſide, thou in thy Brow.

The ſame your Weapons; Love's inflaming Brand

Thou in thy Looks ſhalt bear, he in his hand:

Both too ſhall ſhoot at and wound humane Hearts,

Thou with thine Eyes (ſweet Boy) he with his Darts.

This lovely Youth, with divine graces crown'd,

As yet three Luſtres ſcarce had ſeen go round,

When in his Mind a Reſolution grew

Of bidding Phrygia, and the Cave adue.

Deſire of knowledge, and the Love of Fame,

For Travell his aſpiring thoughts inflame.

How oft he wiſh'd his Fathers Wings? that ſo

He might each clime the Sun enlightens know:

And view what e'r the Earths vaſt Boſome holds,

Or in its watry Arms the Sea infolds.

The Lycia [...] Realms he view'd; and there ſurvay'd

The Hill, within whoſe dark, and dreadfull ſhade

The triple-ſhap'd Chim [...]ra once did dwell

That animated Aetna, living Hell,

Which from three ſooty Jaws, us'd to expire

A ſulph'ry Deluge, and belch Floods of fire.

To Caria next his Courſe he bends; where he

Through that well-peopled Land doth wondring ſee

The numerous Villages like ſhrubs to riſe,

The Cities towre like Cedars to the Skies;

Whoſe fertile Borders with its winding waves

Tow'rd the cold North the fam'd Meander laves;

Which (like a Traveller on ſome ſtrange Coaſt,

Having his firſt Path, his Directreſs, loſt,

[[Page 7]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=6) VVith
devious ſteps, now in, now out doth wind,

Flies what he ſeeks, and meets what he declin'd,

Loſt in the Errour of ambiguous waies)

Its ſelf impriſons in a watry Maze.

At length he to that fatall Place arriv'd

VVhere envious Love his ſad Revenge contriv'd.

So pleaſant and delightful was the Place,

That Heavens great Eye in its Diurnall Race

Yet ne'r beheld another like unto't,

Of all 'twixt Ganges head, and Calpe's foot.

There to a round which a fair Proſpect lends,

Its flowry ſurface a large Plain extends;

A hundred little Brooks its Boſome trace,

And with their ſtreams of Quickſilver enchace;

VVhich with ſweet vernall Dews ſupply'd, ſtill yeeld

Life to the Flowers, and Verdure to the Field;

That may, with odorous Jewels thus aray'd,

A heaven of flowers, or  [...]ield of ſtars be ſaid.

And what more Pleaſure adds; this pleaſant Ground,

Tall Trees, as with a leavy wall ſurround,

And 'bout it ſeem like a green work to run

As if to ſconce it 'gainſt the ſcorching Sun.

And as ſometimes the Airs ſoft breath we find,

Criſps the ſmooth Sea; ſo here a gentle wind,

(VVhoſe ſofter wing the Flowers does lightly bruſh)

Curles into trembling waves the fields green Pluſh.

I'th' midd'ſt of this fair Plain, the tumid Earth,

(As if impregnate with a fruitfull Birth)

Swels gently up into an eaſie Hill:

VVhere crown'd with ſweets the ſpring ſits ſmiling ſtill.

And, as from thence ſhe ſheds her balmy ſhowres,

The ground with graſſe enamels, that with flowe [...]s.

VVhoſe pregnant VVomb a Chryſtall iſſue teems;

VVhich as it glides along with purling ſtreams,

[[Page 8]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=7) (That
ſettle in a verdant Vale;) does make

Of a ſmall Rivolet, an ample Lake;

In which no Weeds their muddy dwelling have

To ſtain the native cleerneſs of the Wave▪

But as the Sun pure Chriſtal by its light

Tranſpierces; ſo the penetrating ſight

May through the Water here, the bottom ſpy,

Checkerd with Pibbles of a various dye:

And ſee how the Mute People of the Floud,

With Ebon Backs, and Silver Bellies ſcudd.

The Flowers which on its fertile Borders grow,

As if in Love with their own Beauties ſhew:

Bending their fragrant Tops, and ſlender Stems

Narciſſus-like, to gaze on the clear Streams.

Where limb'd in Water Colours to the Life

They ſee themſelves; and raiſe a pleaſing ſtrife

In the deluded Senſe at the firſt View

To judge which Flowers are Counterfeit, which true.

On the left hand of this tranſparent Floud,

Fringing the Plaines green Verge, there ſtands a Wood

Where Lovers Myrtles, and the Poets Bays,

Their ſpreading Tops to Native Arbors raiſe:

From whoſe tall Crowns like a black Vaile the ſhade

Falling, the Lakes cleer Boſome does invade.

So thick the Trees are they exclude Heavens ſight,

And make a leavy Skreen 'gainſt the Suns Light.

Whoſe cloſe-weav'd Branches a new Heaven preſent

And to the Sight form a green Firmament:

In which like fixed Stars one might eſpie

Gold-colour'd Apples glitter to the Eye.

Which though no Motion Circular they run,

Want not yet that of Trepidation.

No vulgar birds there make their mean Abodes,

But winged Heroes, Muſicks Demy Gods,

[[Page 9]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=7) Whoſe
Plumes like Gems, with various Colours ſhine,

Their Beaks of Orient Hew, their Notes Divine:

Whileſt this ſweet Place ſeems a retired Cell,

Where Love and Flora with the Muſes dwell.

VVithin theſe dark, yet pleaſant Coverts bred,

Cloſe by the Lake, a Nymph inhabited:

A Nymph; her Breaſt more ſnowy, Looks more fair,

Her Eyes more Diamonds, and more Gold her Hair,

Than ever Nymp [...] could boaſt that hath been ſeen

To haunt the VVoods, or preſs the flowry Green.

The Chace ſhe lov'd not, nor with Hound or Spear

VVould charge the Tusked Bore, or ſavage Bear.

Nor at a Mark or Quarry Bow would bend:

Nor in a Race with other Nymphs contend.

To her the Naiades would often ſay,

Fair Salmacis, fair Cynthia's Laws obey:

Her ſports purſue; and in thy hand a Spear,

Or at thy ſide a painted Quiver bea [...].

But ſhe who other Pleaſures had in Chace,

As the proud Miſtris of ſo proud a Place,

Diſdains to ſet a Foot beyond the Bounds

Of thoſe lov'd ſhades, or tread on meaner grounds.

There with its liquid ſtreams the neighbouring Lake

A Luke-warm Bath for her fair Limbs did make.

The Neighbouring Lake; which oft it ſelf diſcovers,

Swell'd by the Tears of her forſaken Lovers.

In whoſe unflattering Mirrour, every Morn,

She Counſell takes how beſt her ſelf t'adorn.

There ſhe ſometimes her looſer Curles unwinds,

Now up again in Golden Fillets binds,

Which makes (which way ſoever them ſhe wears)

For amorous hearts a thouſand catching Snares.

A Robe, like that of Day, now wears ſhe, white,

Now one of Azure, ſtarr'd like that of Night.

[[Page 10]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=8) Now
curious Sandals on her feet doth ſlip,

In Gems, and Gold leſſe rich, than Workmanſhip.

Now in a careleſſe Dreſs ſhe goes; her Hair

Spred 'bout her ſhoulders, and her Ankles bare.

And gathering Flowers, not all alike doth pick,

But ſuch alone doth in her Boſome ſtick,

Whoſe leaves, or Milk, or Scarlet, does inveſt,

To ſuit in Colour with her Lip and Breſt.

And if a Flower ſhe pull, ſtrait from its Root

Another riſes up to kiſſe her Foot;

Thus whether more ſhe take or give none knows,

Whilſt her Hand gathers what her Foot beſtows.

By chance ſhe then was gathering Flowers, when ſhe

The Son of Venus ſpi'd, and Mercury:

On whoſe bright Looks her wanton Eyes ſhe bent,

With which her longing Thoughts mov'd with Conſent,

VVhil'ſt both her Sight, and Thoughts by ſeeing bred,

VVith pleaſure on ſo ſweet an Object fed.

But ſhe ſucks in Loves poyſon with deſire,

VVhich through her Eyes glides like a ſtream of fire

Into her Breſt; where, with Aetnaean VVaves

Firing her Heart, the ſcalding Torrent raves.

And now ſhe forward goes like a bold Lover,

Her flames to him that caus'd them, to diſcover.

But coming neer, ſhe ſaw in's eyes there plaid

A wantonneſs with Modeſty allayd:

VVhich though the Gazers Heart it ſet on Fire,

Quench'd yet the heat of a too bold Deſire:

VVhence though Love ſpurr'd her on, fear held her back,

And though her heart did fly, her pace did ſlack.

Yet ſhe obſerv'd to lighten in his Look

I know not what Majeſtick Grace, which ſtrook

Her Eye not with more Terrour than Delight,

And leſſe did dazle than it did invite.

[[Page 11]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=8) VVhence
fir'd with hope, yet freezing with deſpair,

She nearer fearfully approach'd; and there

Sent him by the light waftage of the VVind,

A ſigh, an Ah Mee, Nuncios of her Mind.

And now her Paſſion gaining vent, affords

Her Tongue the liberty and uſe of words.

But lame, and broken; yet that ſerve t'imply,

'Twas this ſhe meant, Be kind, or elſe I dye.

"Sweet Stranger! if a Soul lodge in thy Breſt

"Fair as thy outſide, hear a Nymphs Requeſt:

"That begs thou'lt take thy Inn up in this ſhade.

"(And Gods their dwellings in the woods have made.)

"Here on this Bank may'ſt thou repoſe thy Head,

"Or on my Boſome make thy ſofter Bed:

"The Air here ſtill is ſweet, ſtill cool; if by

"My ſighs inflam'd it be not, or thy Eye.

"That Eye which quick as lightning Flames does dart;

"And ſooner then I ſaw it, ſcorch'd my Heart.

"O more than happy wert thou, Salmacis!

"If he (but dream not of ſo great a Bliſs)

"Should prove ſo kind to lay thee by his ſide,

"Not as his Miſtris only, but his Bride.

"But if that Joy another do poſſeſs,

"O let me, as her Rivall ne'rtheleſs

"(Since here is none that may the Theft reveal)

"From thy ſweet Lips a kiſs in private ſteal.

"But ſhould ſome Goddeſs nouriſh in thy Breſt

"A nobler fire; deny not a requeſt

"To one that dyes; if more I cannot move,

"A kiſs for pitty grant, if not for Love.

"Or if too much that ſeem; pray let me have

"What Siſters yet may from their Brothers crave.

Here ceaſt to ſpeak; and with that forward preſt

To have joynd Lip to Lip, and Breſt to Breſt.

[[Page 12]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=9) But the
ſhy youth coyly repulſt her ſtill,

As cold in Love, as deaf unto her will,

Dying with Bluſhes of a deeper ſtain,

The native Crimſon of his Cheeks, in Grain.

(For a bold Suter, of a cold denier

When he the heart cannot, the face will fire)

At laſt with a coy look, thus mov'd, he ſpake.

"Fair Nymph be gon, or I the place forſake.

"You but deceive your ſelf to think my Mind

"Will to ſuch wanton Follies be enclin'd,

At which (with his deſires glad to comply,

Yet loath to loſe the pleaſure of her Eye)

She ſadly creeps behind a buſhy Skreen,

There cloſely skulks to ſee, and not be ſeen.

And now the Planet worſhip'd in the Eaſt,

Rid on the Back of the Nemaean Beaſt;

And from the inflam'd Meridian that bends

Like to a Bow, his Beams like Arrows ſends.

When this fair Traveller, with heat oppreſt,

And the days Toyls, here laid him down to reſt

Where the ſoft Graſs, and the thick Trees, diſplaid

A flowry Couch, and a cool Arbour made.

About him round the graſſy ſpires (in hope

To gain a kiſſe) their verdant heads perk'd up.

The Lilly, the fields Candidate, there ſtands

A Suter for the favour of his hands:

And here the bluſh-dy'd Amaranthus ſeeks,

And finds it ſelfe outrivald in his Cheeks:

Whil'ſt the enamoured Trees t'embrace him, bend

Their ſhady Crowns, and leavy Arms extend.

Mean time from his fair Front he rains a ſhowre

Of ſhining Pearl-drops, whilſt his bright Eyes powre

On the Nymphs Heart (that melts through hot deſire

T' enjoy what ſhe beholds) a Flood of fire.

[[Page 13]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=9) This Place
at length he leaves, rous'd by the Call

Of the neer waters ſweetly murmuring fall.

Where, on the Bank his Sandals off he ſlips,

And in the Chriſtal ſtreams his Ankles dips.

Whil'ſt the cleer Lake, as his pure feet he laves,

Feels Love's warm Fires mix with its colder VVaves.

And now, not his fair feet content alone

To kiſſe, deſires, (an amorous VVanton grown)

(That ſhe might nearer to her wiſh aſpire)

Her Bottom deeper, or her VVaters higher.

VVhich (to their power) to riſe when moved ſeem,

As if they long'd to bath each curious Limb.

The Youth with pleaſure on the Floud doth gaze,

And in that watery glaſſe his Face ſurvaies,

Admiring, with a Look ſtedfaſtly ſet,

His reall Beauty in his Counterfeit.

And ſure he with himſelf in Love had fell,

Had he not heard of fond Narciſſus tell,

VVho from cold ſtreams attracting fatall fire,

Did, to enjoy what he poſſeſt, expire.

Then ſtooping, he with hands together clos'd,

Hollowing their joyned Palmes, a cup compos'd

Of living Alablaſter; which when fill'd

VVith the ſweet Liquor the cleer Spring diſtill'd,

He gently lifts it to his head, then ſips,

Both bath and Beverage to his Looks and Lips.

Mean time with raviſh'd thoughts the Nymph doth view

The ſportive Lad, and whil'ſt he drinks, drinks too,

But in a different Manner: from the Lake

He his, her draught, ſhe from his Eyes doth take.

His ſlacks his Thirſt, hers more inflames deſire,

He ſucks in VVater, but ſhe drinks in Fire.

And now, invited by the heat, and took

VVith the alluring Temper of the Brook,

[[Page 14]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=10) Himſelf
diſroabing, the rich ſpoyl he throws

Away, and his pure Limbs all naked ſhows.

And like a new Sun with a darkening Cloud

Inveſted, caſting off the envious ſhrowd,

He round about his beautious Light diſplaies,

And makes the Earth a Heaven with his bright Raies.

The Nymph at this freezes at once and burns,

And fire with Love and Ice with wonder turns.

At length cries out; Ah me! what ſee I here?

What Deity leaving his heavenly Sphere

Is come to ſport him in theſe ſhades? ſure by

His wounding Look, and his inflaming Eye

It ſhould be Love; but no light Wings appear

On his fair ſhoulders; ſtrange he none ſhould wear!

No; thoſe he lent my heart; which from my Breſt

Its flight hath took, and now in his doth reſt.

Ah me thou living Aetna! cloath'd in ſnow,

Yet breathing flames, how lovely doſt thou ſhew?

Cruell, yet cunning Archer! that my Heart

Thou ſure might'ſt hit, t' allure me with the Dart.

But now from the green Bank on which he ſtood,

Fetching his Riſe, he leaps into the Floud.

Whoſe fall, (as him the breaking Waters take)

With a white foame all ſilvers o'r the Lake.

Where, as he ſwims, and his fair Arms now bends,

Now their contracted Nerves again extends,

He the Nymphs Heart (that peeps behind an Oake)

Wounds from that Ivory Bow at every ſtroak.

Into another Form he then converts

The Motion of his Arms, and like to Darts,

Now this, now that, through the cleer Waves does ſhoot,

His Hand in Motion anſwer'd by his Foot.

For as he this Contracts, he that extends,

And when this forward, that he backward ſends.

[[Page 15]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=10) Whilſt
through the ſtreams his purer Limbs, like ſnow

Or Lillies through tranſparent Chryſtall ſhow.

His flowing Hair, floating like that rich Fleece

Which the firſt Ship from Colchos brought to Greece.

The Nymph at this ſtands as of ſenſe quite void,

Or as no Sence but Seeing ſhe enjoy'd.

At laſt from her full Breſt (of its cloſe fire

The ſparks) theſe broken Accents did expire.

"O why (as Arethuſa, or the Joy

"Of Galatea) cannot I (ſweet Boy)

"Melt to a floud for thee? then (my fair Sun!)

"Thou might'ſt (to bath thee) to my Boſome run.

More would ſh' have ſaid: but her full Paſſion ſtopt

Her Door of Speech, and her Eyes Floodgates op't.

Struck with Deſpair ſo dead, ſhe ſcarce appears

To breath, or live, but by her ſighs and tears;

Yet though her ſilent Tongue no Words impart,

Her ſpeaking Thoughts diſcours'd thus with her heart.

"Fond Salmacis! why ſlag thy hopes? thy Mind

"What fears deject? on; nor be e'r declin'd;

"But boldly thy fair Enemy aſſail.

"See! thy deſired Prey's within the Pale:

"And Love (perhaps in pitty of thy Pain,)

"Offers what was deny'd thee by diſdain.

"Be reſolute; and him whoſe conquering Eyes

"Made thee his Captive late, now make thy Prize.

"Fear not; for pardon juſtly hope he may

"Who plunders him that does deny to pay.

Thus ſhe, rekindling her half-quench'd deſires,

Her Cheeks with Bluſhes, heart with boldneſs fires.

Then forward moves a little; and anon

Full ſpeed, unto the Lake does madly run.

But in the mid'ſt of her Careere, repents,

And ſtops; ſuſpended 'twixt two croſs Intents

[[Page 16]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=11) Like to a
wavering Ballance; on, afraid,

Back, loth to go, and yet to either ſway'd.

Now ſhe advances; then again retreats:

Her fears now conquers, then her hopes defeats.

Struck with Loves powerfull Thyrſus, at the laſt

(True Manad-like) her lighter Robes off caſt,

She hurries to the Lake, then in ſhe skips;

And in her wanton Arms th' unwilling clips.

He, who Loves Fires ne'r felt in his cold Breſt,

With fear at ſuch a ſtrange ſurprize poſſeſs'd,

For help began to cry; when ſhe at this,

Ah, peace, ſaies; and his Mouth ſtop'd with a kiſs.

Yet ſtrugg'ling he her Wiſhes did deny,

And from her ſhunn'd Embraces ſtrove to fly.

But whil'ſt he labours to get looſe, t'his Breſt

She faſter cleaves; and his Lips harder preſt.

So when Joves Bird a Snake hath truſs'd, his Wings

The more that plies, the more that 'bout 'em clings,

And leaves it doubtfull to the Gazers view,

To tell which more is Pris'ner of the two.

Fearfull to loſe yet her new-gotten prize,

The Nymph to heaven (ſighing) erects her Eyes.

"And ſhall my Love (ſaies ſhe) triumph in vain,

"Nor other Trophy than a bare kiſs gain?

"O Jove! if what Fame ſings of thee be true,

"If e'r thou did'ſt a Bulls fierce ſhape indue,

"And on thy Back from the Phaenician ſhore,

"Through Seas thy Amorous Theft in Triumph bore,

"Aſſiſt my Vows; and grant that I may prove

"As happy in this Conqueſt of my Love:

"No force let our Embraces e'r disjoyn;

"Breſt unto Breſt unite; our ſouls entwine;

"Tye heart to heart; and let the knitting charmes

"Sweet kiſſes be; the Fetters, our ſoft Arms.

[[Page 17]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=11) "Or if
thou haſt decreed that we muſt part

"Let that Divorce divide life from my Heart.

Jove heard her Prayers; and ſuddenly as ſtrange,

Made of them both a mutuall Interchange;

And by an undiſcern'd conjunction,

Two late divided Bodies, knit in One:

Her Body ſtraight a Manly Vigor felt,

And his did to a Female ſoftneſs melt.

Yet thus united, they with difference

Retain'd their proper Reaſon, Speech, and Sence.

He liv [...]d and ſhe appart; yet each in either;

Both one might well be ſaid, yet that One, neither.

This Story by a Rivers ſide (as they

Sate and diſcours'd the tedious hours away)

Amintas to the coy Iole told:

Then adds; O thou more fair, in Love more cold

Than he, Heaven yet may make thee mine in ſpite,

That can ſuch Differents, Ice and fire, unite.

This with a Sigh the Shepheard ſpake; whilſt ſhe

With a coy ſmile mock'd his ſimplicity.

But now the ſetting Sun poaſting away,

Put both an End to their Diſcourſe and Day.

FINIS.

### 1.2. The Metamorphoſis of LYRIAN and SYLVIA,

by St Amant. Out of French.

UNder that pleaſant Clime, where Nature plac'd

Thoſe Iſlands, with the name of Happy grac'd,

There liv'd a young, and gentle Shepheard late,

And had he never lov'd, too fortunate;

His Name was Lyrian, ſhe whoſe looks enthral'd

His amorous heart, was the fair Sylvia call'd.

The Natives there, 'mongſt whom ſtill lives his Name,

(Nor ſhall the Waſte of time impair it's Fame)

Report, he bare for ſweetneſs of his Song,

The Prize from all Apollo's learned Throng.

Yet nor his Voice, nor Worth that did exceed,

And ev'n in Envy Admiration breed,

Could e' [...] move her that o'r his heart did raign,

To pleaſing Joys to turn his amorous pain.

The Cheerfull fields, and Solitary Groves,

(Once loyall Secretaries to his Loves)

Are ſtill the Witneſſes, and ſtill ſhall be,

Of his chaſte thoughts, and firm fidelity.

For they alone were conſcious of his Grief,

They only gave his Wonded Soul Relief,

[[Page 20]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=13) When with
the Weight of his ſad Woes oppreſt,

They pittying, heard him eaſe in Plaints, his Breſt.

Ye Gods! how oft reſolv'd he, yet declin'd,

(Although he felt his heart with flames calcin'd)

Before thoſe Eyes h' ador'd ſo, to diſplay

His Griefes! Such Modeſty his Soul did ſway.

And though h' had learn'd, and knew to ſuffer much,

Yet were his Manners and Diſcretion ſuch,

Silence ſhould firſt in death have quench'd his flame,

E'r he'ld have rudely voic'd it unto  [...]ame.

Nor had it yet to any (had not Stone

And ſtocks diſcover'd it) been ever known.

Which, (for on them he us'd his Plaints t' inciſe)

By chance preſented it to Sylvia's Eyes.

This ſeen, in her does Scorn and Anger move;

O heavens! is't poſſible that ſuch a Love

She ſhould deſpiſe; and him who had profeſt

Himſelf her Captive, as her Foe deteſt?

Or that Love's Magick Characters his hand

Had grav'd, ſhould in her Eye for Cyphers ſtand?

Or ſhe ſhould read them yet with ſo much ſpight,

Ne'r more to ſee them, leſs to  [...]aze them quite?

Ah 'tis too true! nor's that ſufficient,

Unleſs her Tongue to her hard heart conſent,

And 'gainſt her faithfull Love, with cruell Breath

Pronounce the rigid ſentence of his Death.

What ſaid he not his Paſſion to excuſe?

What flouriſhes us'd not his willing Muſe,

To prove, his Love (of which the noble ground

Was her Perfections) could no Crime be found!

If neither Reaſons ſelf, nor Juſtice, ought

(Thoſe for which Heaven is lov'd) as Crimes be thought

That the Worlds Soveraign Planet which the Earth

And Mortals Fates does govern from their Birth,

[[Page 21]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=13) By firm
Decrees inrolled in the Skies

Had deſtin'd him a Servant to her Eyes.

And could his Will be lead another way,

Yet being forc'd he could not diſobey.

So that his Soul in this her Captiv'd ſtate

Did only yeeld to her impulſive Fate;

Not that (ſaid he) he murmur'd at his Chains,

But pleas'd, ſat down and bleſt his rigorous Pains;

Not but his Yoak ſo willingly he bare

That Liberty a greater Bondage were;

Not but in ſpight of his malicious fate,

(In croſſing all his Joys ſo obſtinate)

He ſhould unforc'd, ev'n to the Grave affect

That Beauty which his Love did ſo neglect.

Yet theſe his Reaſons, ſo well urg'd, ſo fair,

With her that will hear none, no Reaſons are.

They more incenſe her: yet for fear ſhe might

Be ſoftned, ſhe betook her ſelf to flight.

Such were the winning Graces of his Tongue,

Proving his Love did not her Beauty wrong.

How oft ſince that, by all fair means he tri'd

(Whil'ſt he the Gods with Sacrifices ply'd)

To bring the humorous Nymph unto his Bent,

And make her too obdurate Heart relent!

His Paſſions, Sighs, and Tears were ready ſtill,

As the officious Agents of his Will,

To work her to a ſenſe of his hard State;

But 'laſs! his hopes grew ſtill more deſperate,

Nay ev'n his voice, of ſo divine a ſtrain,

So moving! mov'd in her nought but diſdain.

Six years he liv'd perplex'd in this diſtreſs,

Without the leaſt Apparence of ſucceſs;

When he by chance (as ſhe a Stag purſu'd)

Encounter'd her: who e'r the Queen hath view'd

[[Page 22]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=14) Of Wood-
Nymphs, (Cynthia) a hunting goe

After the Bore, arm'd with her ſhafts and Bow,

May then imagine the diviner Grace,

The Looks, the Habit, Stature, and the Pace

Of beautious Sylvia, as ſhe tripping came

Into the VVoods, purſuing of her Game.

Soon as poor Lyrian, half dead with Love,

Had ſpy'd her in that ſolitary Grove

For whom his wounded heart ſo long had bled,

He with theſe words purſues her as ſhe fled.

Art thou reſolv'd then (Sylvia) 'gainſt my Cries

Thine Ears to cloſe, and 'gainſt my Verſe thine Eyes?

That Verſe which Fame unto thy Life does give;

And muſt I d [...], 'cauſe I have made thee live

Eternally? Seven years expired be

Since I've been tortur'd by thy Cruelty;

And doſt thou think that little ſtrength ſupplies

My heart, for everlaſting Torments will ſuffice?

Shall I for ever only ſee thee ſtray

'Mongſt theſe wild VVoods, more ſenſeleſs yet than they?

Alas! how weak I'm grown with Grief! I feel

My feeble Legs beneath their Burden reel;

O ſtay! I faint, nor longer can purſue,

Stay, and ſince Senſe thou lack'ſt, want Motion too.

Stay, if for nothing elſe, to ſee me dye.

At leaſt vouchſafe ſtern Nymph to tell me why

Thou cam'ſt into this Dark and Gloomy Place?

VVhere Heaven with all its Eyes can never trace

Or find thee out. VVas't thy Intent, the Light

Of thy fair Stars thus to obſcure in Night?

Or ſeek'ſt thou theſe cool ſhades, the Ice and Snow

That's 'bout thy Heart to keep unmelted ſo?

In vain Coy Nymph thou Light and Heat doſt ſhun,

VVho e'r knew cold or ſhade attend the Sun?

[[Page 23]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=14) Ah Cruell
Nymph! the Rage doſt thou not fear

Of thoſe wild Beaſts that in theſe VVoods appear?

No, no, thou art ſecure▪ and mayſt out-vy

Both them and all the VVorld for Cruelty.

Oh thou that glorieſt in a heart of ſtone!

VVilt thou not ſtay? yet ſeeſt (as if my Moan

They pittied) each rough Bramble 'bout thy foot

Does cling, and ſeems t' arreſt thee at my Sute?

Ye Gods! what VVonders do you here diſcloſe?

The Bramble hath more ſweetneſs than the Roſe.

But whether fly theſe idle VVords? in vain

Poore, miſerable VVretch, thou doſt complain,

After ſo many Ills, (of which I bear

The ſadder Marks yet in my heart;) Now hear

Ye Gods at laſt! and by a welcome Death

A period put unto my wretche [...] Breath.

Ah me! I ſaint; my ſpirits quite decay;

And yet I cannot move her heart to ſtay.

Ye helliſh Deeps! black Gulp [...]s where Horror lies,

Open, and place your ſelves before her Eyes.

Had I Hippomenes bright Fruit, which ſtay'd

The ſwifter ſpeed of the Schenaeian Maid,

They would not profit me; the VVorlds round Ball

Could not my cruell Fugitive Recall.

She is all Rock, and I who am all fire,

Purſue her Night and Day with vain deſire.

O Nature! is it not a Prodigie

To find a Rock than fire more light to be?

But I miſtake: for if a Rock ſhe were

Shee'd anſwer me again as theſe do here.

Thus tyr'd with running, and o'rcome with VVoe,

To ſee his Miſtris ſhould out-ſtrip him ſo,

Poor Lyrian yeelds himſelf as ſorrows Prize,

His Conſtancy and amorous Fervor dies,

[[Page 24]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=15) Bloudy
diſpair entring his captiv'd Soul,

Does like a Tyrant all his Powers controul.

Then in the height of VVoe to his Relief

He cals the Gods, yet in the mid'ſt of Grief

All fair Reſpect does ſtill to Sylvia give,

To ſhew that ev'n in Death his Love ſhould live.

He who for Daphne like Regret did prove,

And the horn'd God (who breathleſs, thought his Love

The fair-hair'd Syrinx in his Arms he claſp'd,

And ſlender Reeds for her lov'd Body graſp'd)

So far, (remembring their like amorous Fate)

His unjuſt ſufferings commiſerate,

That both ſtraight ſwore in Paſſion, and diſdain,

To puniſh the proud Author of his Pain:

Their powerfull Threats alike effect purſues;

See I that proud Beanty a Trees ſhape endues.

Each of her Hairs does ſprout into a Bough,

And ſhe that was a Nymph, an Elm is now.

VVhilſt thus transform'd, her feet (to Roots ſpred) ſtuck

Faſt in the ground, ſhe was at laſt o'rtook

By panting Lyrian; happy yet, to ſee

Her he ſo priz'd within his Power to be;

Ye Gods then ſaies he! who by this ſad Teſt

Have 'fore mine Eyes Natures great Power expreſt,

Grant that to this fair Trunk which Love ne'r knew

My heart may yet a Love eternall ſhew.

This having ſaid, unto the yet warm Bole

He clings, (whilſt a new Form inveſts his Soul)

VVinding in thouſand twines about it, whence

Hee's call'd of Love the perfect Symbole ſince.

In brief, this faithfull Lover now is found

An Ivy Stock; which creeping from the ground

About the loved ſtem, ſtill climbing is,

As if he ſought her Mouth to ſteal a Kiſ [...]:

[[Page 25]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=15) Each
leafe's a heart; whoſe colour does imply

His wiſh obtain'd, Loves Perpetuity;

VVhich ſtill his ſtrict Embraces evidence.

For all of him is loſt but only ſence,

And that you  [...]d ſwear remains; and ſay (to ſee

The Elm in his Embraces hugg'd) that he

VVilling to keep what he had gain'd at laſt,

For fear ſhe ſhould eſcape, holds her ſo faſt.

FINIS.

### 1.3. Forſaken LYDIA.

Out of the Italian of Cavalier Marino.

IN Thunder now the hollow Cannon roar'd,

To call the farre-fam'd Warriours aboard,

Who that great feud (enkindled 'twixt the French

And German) with their bloud attempt to quench.

Now in the open Sea they proudly ride,

And the ſoft Chryſtall with rude Oares divide;

Perfidious Armillus at once tore

His Heart from Lydia, Anchor from the ſhore.

[...]T was Night, and Aged Proteus had driv'n home

His numerous Heard, fleec't with the Seas white fome;

The Winds were laid to reſt, the fiſhes ſlept,

The wearied world a generall ſilence kept,

No noiſe, ſave from the Surges hollow caves,

Or liquid ſilver of the juſtling waves,

Whilſt the bright Lanthorns ſhot ſuch trembling light,

As dazled all the twinkling eyes of Night.

[[Page 28]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=17)

The faire Inamorata (who from farre

Had ſpy'd the Ship which her hearts treaſure bare,

Put off from Land; and now quite diſembay'd,

Her Cables coiled, and her Anchors weigh'd,

Whilſt gentle gales her ſwelling ſailes did court

To turn in ſcorn her Poop upon the Port)

With frantick ſpeed from the deteſted Town

To the deſerted ſhore comes hurrying down.

As the Idaean Shepheard ſtood amaz'd,

Whilſt on the ſacred Raviſher he gaz'd,

Who ſnatch'd the beauteous Trojan youth away,

And wafted through the yeelding Clouds his prey;

Or as that Artiſt whoſe bold hand durſt ſhape

Wings to his ſhoulders (deſperately to ſcape

A loathed ſervitude) through untrac'd skies

Creets King purſu'd with fierce, yet wondring Eyes:

The flying Navy Lyd [...]a ſo beheld,

Her Eyes with Teares, her Heart with Paſſion ſwell'd;

In ſighs to theſe ſhe gave continuall vent,

And thoſe in briniſh ſtreames profuſely ſpent:

But tears and ſighs alas beſtowes in vain,

Borne by the ſportive Wind to the deaf Main;

The Main, who griefe inexorably mocks,

As ſhe her ſelf is ſcorn'd by ſteady Rocks▪

[[Page 29]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=17)

O what a black Eclipſe did ſtraight diſguiſe

In Clouds the Sunſhine of her lovely Eyes!

She tore her Cheeks, Hair, Garments, and impreſt

Marks of his falſhood on her guiltleſſe breaſt.

She cals on her diſloyall Lovers Name,

And ſends ſuch ſad loud Accents to reclame

The Fugitive, as if at every cry

Her weary ſoul forth with her voice would fly.

Whither, ah Cruell! There, full grief repreſt

Her Tongue, and taught her Eyes to weep the reſt;

Whither, ah Cruell, from the hollow ſide

Of the next Rock the Vocall Nymph replied.

In Tears and Sighs the Water and the Aire

Contend which in her ſorrowes moſt ſhall ſhare;

And the ſad Sea hoarſe with inceſſant grones

Wakens her faint grief, and ſupplyes her mones.

Oh ſtop kind Zephyre bu [...] one minutes ſpace,

(She cries) the ſwelling Sailes impetuous race,

That my expiring groanes may reach the eare

Of him who flyes from her he will not heare.

Perhaps, though whilſt alive I cannot pleaſe,

My dying Cryes his Anger may appeaſe,

And my laſt Fall, Trophey of his Diſdain,

May yeeld delight, and his loſt Love regain▪

[[Page 30]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=18)

Receive my heart in this extreme farewell,

Thou in whom Cruelty and Beauty dwell,

With Thee it fied; but what alas for me

Is it to loſe my Heart who have loſt Thee?

Thou art my better ſelfe; Thou of my heart,

The ſoul, more than the ſoul that moves it, art:

And if thou ſentence me to ſuffer death

(My Life) to Thee let me reſign my breath.

Alas I doe not aske to live content,

That were a bleſſing me Fate never meant;

All that my wiſhes a [...]me at, is, that I

(And that's but a poore wiſh) Content may dye;

And if my heart, by Thee already ſlain,

Some reliques yet of a loath'd life retain,

Oh let them by thy pitty find releaſe,

And in thy Armes breath forth their laſt in Peace.

No greater happineſſe than Death I crave,

So in thy deareſt sight I death may have;

And if thy hand, arm'd with relentleſſe Pride,

Shall the ſmall thread of my poor Life divide,

What Pleaſure than that Sorrow would be higher?

VVhen I in Paradice at leaſt expire;

And ſo at once the different Arrowes prove,

Of Death from thy hand, from thy Eyes of Love.

[[Page 31]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=18)

Ah! if ſo pleas'd thou art with Wars alarmes;

If that be it that cals thee from my Armes;

If thou aſpi [...]'ſt by ſome advent'rous toiles

To raiſe proud Trophyes deckt with glorious ſpoiles,

Why fondly doſt thou ſeek for theſe elſewhere?

Why leav' [...]t thou me a pris'ner to deſpair?

Turn; nor thy willing Captive thus forſake,

And thou ſhalt all my Victories partake.

Though I to thy dear Eyes a Captive be,

Thouſands of Lovers are no leſſe to me.

Unhappy! who contend and ſue for ſight

Of that which thou unkindly thus doſt ſlight;

Is't not a high attempt that can comprize

Within one Act ſo many Victories;

To triumph over Triumphs, and ſubdue

At once the Victor and the Vanquiſh'd too?

But if to ſtay with me thou doſt refuſe,

And the rude Company of Souldiers chooſe,

Yet give me leave to goe along with Thee,

And in the Army thy Attendant be.

Love, though a child and blind, the Wars hath known▪

Can handle Armes, and buckle Armour on;

And thou ſhalt ſee, my courage will diſdain

(Save of thy Death) all fear to entertain,

[[Page 32]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=19)

I will ſecurely 'midſt the arm'd Troops run,

Venus hath been Mars 'his Companion;

And though the heart in thy obdurate Breaſt

Be with an Adamantine Corſlet dreſt,

Yet I in ſtead (to guard thee from all harm)

With my own hands will thy fair body arm,

And the Reward Love did from me detain

In peace, in War ſhall by this ſervice gain.

And if it fortune that thou undergoe

Some dangerous hurt by the prevailing Foe,

I ſadly by thy ſide will ſit to keep

Thee company, and as thou groan'ſt will weep.

My Sorrow with thy Anguiſh ſhall comply,

I will thy Bloud, and thou my Tears ſhalt dry:

Thus by an equall ſympathy of pure

Affections we each others wounds will cure.

Perhaps when he this ſweet effect of Love

Shall ſee, the happy Preſident may move

The ſtubborn Enemy more mild to grow,

And to ſo ſoft a yoak his ſtiffe neck bow,

Who by himſelf gladly betraid to thine,

Shall willingly his own Command reſigne.

So by a way of Conqueſt ſtrangely new,

Thou ſhalt at once Love, Armes, and Soules ſubdue.

[[Page 33]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=19)

Ah moſt unhappy! he to theſe ſad cries

Inexorable his deafe eare denies;

And far more cruell than the rough Seas are,

Laughs at my ſighs, and ſlights my juſter Prayer.

See, whilſt 'thou ſpreadſt thy ſailes to catch the Wind,

What a ſad Object thou haſt left behind.

Of War alas why doſt thou goe in queſt?

Thou leav'ſt a fiercer War within my Breaſt.

Thou fly'ſt thy Country and more happy ſtate▪

To ſeek in ſome ſtrange Land a ſtranger Fate▪

And under forraign Climes and unknown Stars▪

T' encounter hazards of deſtructive Wars;

Eager to thruſt thy ſelf (laviſh of breath)

Upon Diſaſters, Dangers, Bloud and Death,

Changing (ah too unwary, too unwiſe)

Thy certain Joyes for an uncertain Prize.

Can it be true thou more thy ſelf ſhould'ſt pleaſe

With buſie troubles than delightfull eaſe,

And lik'ſt th' enraged Deeps rough toiles above

The calmer pleaſures and ſweet ſports of Love?

Canſt thou from a ſoft boſome fly (ah loſt

To gentleneſſe▪) to be on rude Waves toſt?

And rather chooſe in Seas a reſtleſſe Grave,

Than in theſe Arms a quiet Port to have?

[[Page 34]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=20)

With furrowing Keel thou plow'ſt the foming Main,

And (O o [...]durate) hearſt not me complain;

Too ſwift thou fly'ſt for Loves ſlow wings t'oretake,

Love, whom perfidiouſly thou didſt forſake;

And all the way thou ſwell'ſt with Pride, to know

The ſuff'rings for thy ſake I undergoe,

Whilſt the mild Eaſt to flatter thy Deſires

With his ſoft Breath thy flagging Sail inſpires.

Go faithleſſe Youth, faithleſſe and fooliſh too,

Thy Fate, or folly rather, ſtill purſue;

Go, and now thou art from my Fetters free,

Never take care who ſighs or dyes for Thee.

Oh! if the Heavens are juſt, if ever they

With Eyes impartiall humane wrongs ſurvey,

Heaven, heaven my tears implore, to Heaven I cry,

Avenge my ſuff'rings, and his Treachery.

Be Seas and Skyes thy foes! no gentle gale

Blow on thy  [...]hrowds! deſtruction ſill thy Saile!

No Star to thee (loſt in deſpair and Night)

When thou invok'ſt, diſcloſe its friendly Light.

To Scythian Pyrats, (ſuch as ſhall deſpiſe

Thy fruitleſs tears) mayſt thou become a Prize,

By whoſe inhumane uſage mayſt thou be

Spoil'd of the Liberty thou took'ſt from me.

[[Page 35]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=20)

Then thou the difference ſhalt underſtand

Betwixt the ſhafts ſhot from a Thracian hand,

And Lovers eye; the odds betwixt a rude

Inſulting Foe, and Loves ſoft ſervitude:

The Breaſt his golden Darts not pierc'd, ſhall feel

The ſharp Impreſſion of more cruell ſteel,

And thou enſlav'd, which are the ſtronger prove

The fetters of Barbarians, or of Love.

Ye Seas and Skies, which of my amorous care

The kindly faithfull Secretaries are,

To you my crying Sorrows I addreſſe,

To you the witneſſes of my diſtreſſe;

Shores by the loſſe of my fair Sun forlorn,

Winds who my ſole delight away have born,

Rocks the Spectators of my hapleſſe Fate,

And Night that hearſt me mourn diſconſolate.

Nor without reaſon is't (alas) that I

To Stars and Sands bewail my miſery;

For with my State they ſome proportion bear,

And numberleſſe as are my woes appear.

Heaven in this Quire of beautious Lights doth ſeem

To repreſent what I have loſſe in him;

The Sea to whom his flight I chiefly owe,

His heart in Rocks, my tears in Waves doth ſhow.

[[Page 36]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=21)

And ſince to theſe Eternall Fires whoſe Light

Makes Sleep's dark Manſion ſo  [...]erenely bright

I turn; what one amongſt them ſhall I find

To pitty me above the reſt inclin'd?

She who in Naxos when forſook did meet

A better Spouſe than him ſhe choſe in Cr [...]et,

Though all the reſt ſeverely are intent

To work me harm, ſhould be more mildly bent.

Oh Thou who guid'ſt the Pompous train of Night,

With the addition of thy glorious Light,

Whoſe radiant hair a Crown adorns, whence ſtreams

The dazling luſtre of ſeven blazing Gems:

If that Extremity thou not forget,

If thy own ſorrows thou remember yet,

Stop at my ſighs a while, and make the Crue

Of thy bright fellows ſtay and hearken too.

Thou know'ſt the like occaſions of our Fate,

Both circumvented by unkind Deceit;

A cruell I, a Love ungratefull Thou

Didſt follow, both to equall ſuff'rings bow,

In this to thine a near reſemblance bears.

The Cauſe that dooms me to eternall Tears;

I now am left as thou wert heretofore

Alone upon the ſolitary Shore.

[[Page 37]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=21)

But how th [...] ever our misfortunes ſhare

The ſame Effects, their Cauſes diff'rent are;

I my poor ſelf no other have deceiv'd;

Thy Brother was through thee of Life bereav'd.

Sleep thy Betrayer was, but Love was mine,

Thou by thy ſhort Eclipſe didſt brighter ſhine,

And in the Skyes a Crown of Stars obtain,

But I on Earth (forſaken) ſtill remain.

Fool, to whoſe care doſt thou thy grief impart?

What doſt thou talk, or know'ſt thou where thou art?

She midſt a dancing Bevy of fair Lights

Trips it away, and thy misfortune ſlights:

Yet happy may ſhe go, and her clear beams,

Whilſt I lament, drench in the Briniſh ſtreams;

Perhaps the Sea to my afflicted ſtate,

Will prove then her leſſe incompaſſionate.

But how on Seas for help ſhould I relye,

Where nothing we but Waves and Rocks can ſpye?

Yet ſo ſmall hopes of ſuccour hath my grief,

That of thoſe Rocks and Waves I beg Relief.

Down from theſe Rocks, of Life my troubled Breaſt,

By a ſad Precipice may be releaſt,

And my impu [...]er ſoul in theſe Waves may

Quench her Looſe Flames, and waſh her ſtains away.

[[Page 38]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=22)

Ah Lydia, Lydia, whither doſt thou ſend

Thy loſt Complaint? Why words ſo fruitleſs ſpend

To angry Waves? to Winds where horror roars?

To Rocks that have no ears? to ſenceleſſe ſhores?

Thou giv'ſt thy grief this Liberty in vain,

If Liberty from grief thou canſt not gain;

And fond preſumption will thy hopes abuſe,

Unleſſe thou grief and life together loſe.

Dye then: ſo ſhall my Ghoſt (as with deſpair

Laden it flyes) raiſe in the troubled Air

Tempeſts more lowd than Thunder, Storms more black

Than Hell or Horrour, in curl'd Waves to wrack

His Ship and him: ſo (and 'tis juſt) ſhall I

And my proud Foe, at leaſt together dy:

On him who firſt theſe bitter Sorrows bred,

Seas ſhall avenge the Seas of Tears I ſhed.

This ſaid, ſhe made a ſtop; and with raſh haſt

(By violent deſpair aſſiſted) caſt

Her ſelf down headlong in the raging Sea,

Where ſhe beleev'd it deepeſt; Now to be

Sadly by her enrich'd; whilſt from her fair

Vermilion lips, bright eyes, Phaebeian hair,

Corall a purer tincture doth endue,

Chryſtall new light, Pearls a more Orient hue.

[[Page 39]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=22)

Such was the hapleſſe fate of Lydia,

Who in thoſe Waves from which the King of Day

Each morn aſcends the bluſhing Eaſt, in thoſe

From which the Queen of Love and Beauty roſe,

A ſecond Queen of Love and Beauty periſh'd,

Who in her Looks a thouſand Graces cheriſh'd;

And by a ſad Fate (not unpittied yet)

A ſecond Sun eternally did ſet.

Sweet Beauty, the ſad wrack of ruthleſſe Seas,

And ill plac'd Love, whom cruell Deſtinies

Have food for Monſters made, and ſport for Waves,

With whom ſo many Graces had their graves,

If vain be not my hopes, If no dead fire

Theſe Lines devoted to thy Name inſpire,

Though buried in the Seas ſalt Waves thouly,

Yet in Oblivions Waves thou ſhalt not dy.

FINIS.

THE Rape of Hellen, Out of the Greek OF COLUTHUS▪ By EDVVARD SHERBURNE Eſq;

LONDON, Printed by W. Hunt, for Tho. Dring, at the Sign of the George, near
Cliffords-Inn in Fleetſtreet. 1651.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=24)

#### 1.4.2. Vpon the Title.

THe Rape, &c.] Not to be taken in the Common acception of the Word: (for Paris
was more courtly than to offer, and Hellen more kind-hearted than to ſuffer,
ſuch a violence;) but rather for a tranſporting of her (with her conſent) from
her own Country to Troy: which Virgil ſeems to inſinuate in the firſt of his
Aeneis, where he ſpeaks to Achates to bring him from the Fleet, amongſt other
Pre­ſents for Dido, a rich Veil; once,

Ornatus Argivae Helenae, quos illa Mycenis

Pergama eum peteret, inconceſſoſque Hymenaeos

Extulerat, &c,

Greek Hellens dreſs, which ſhe from Sparta brought,

When Troy, and lawleſs Marriages ſhe ſought.

Where the Word peteret is to be applyed as well to Hymenaeos as Pergama, and
implies that the quitting of her Country, and going along with Paris, was an
Act ſhe deſir'd as well as conſented to, as Donatus (in 6 Aeneid.)
[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=24) hath rightly
obſerved▪ and thus much the enſuing Poem makes good.

But the Occaſion of this her Rape is diverſly reported: Herodotus writes that
Paris did it in a meere bravery of Knight Erranty, following the Examples of
the Cretans, Phaenicia [...]s, and the Argonauticks, in the Rapes of Europa,
Io, and Medea. Dictys Cr [...]tenſis and others report that being ſent
Embaſſodor unto the Graecian Princes to ne­gotiate for the Releaſe of his Ant
Heſione, or (accord­ing to Plutark in vita Homeri) [...]. to learn Greek
faſhions; and being kindly entertain'd at Sparta in the Court of Menelaus, he
in his abſence ſol­licited his Queen, and having won her Conſent, carried both
her and her two Kinſwomen Clymene and Aethr [...] away with him to Troy.

[...],

[...].

But ſhe in neat-built Ships (as falſely Fame

Gives out) n [...]'r ſail'd, nor e'r at Ilium came.

Saies Steſichorus in his Recantation, after he had been ſtruck blind for
ſlandering Hellen, (with a Matter of Truth) as Plato in Phaedro and Pauſan. in
Lacon. make mention. Euripides likewiſe in her Tragedy (though elſewhere he be
of another Opinion,) makes her not to be rapt by Paris, but conveyed into
Aegypt by Mercury, and there kept in ſafe Cuſtody by Proteus: and that a Cloud
in her Likeneſs was only tranſported by Paris to Troy: which Menelaus after
the end of the Trojan Wars brought away with him, but being driven (in his
Return) upon the Coaſt of Aegypt, loſt there his Cloudy Hellen, and recovered
the true one by the means of Theonoe Pro­teus his Daughter.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=25) But this is
ove [...]born by the generall ſtream of all Poe­ticall Relations, which ſay,
(and our Author here goes along with the Tide) that Hellen was aſſign'd to
Paris, as

Euripid. Iphig. in Aul.

The gift of Venus, when ſhe near

The Fountain cleer,

With Pallas, and the Wife of Jove,

For Beauty ſtrove.

Upon which ſcore he is ſaid to have undertaken a Voy­age to Sparta, and from
thence to have brought her away with him to Troy. Which occaſioned thoſe
fatall and la­ſting Wars, ſo celebrated by Homer in his Iliads, to which this
enſuing Poem, ſeems as it were a Prologue or Pre­ludium.

There be thoſe yet who think her not worth the Ho­nour of ſo famous a
Contention; and Hoelzlin (in Pro­legom: ad Apollon:) ſaith in plain terms,
that Homer might be aſham'd to make that the Argument of his Work, not will
beleeve that any man could be ſuch a Wittall, as to ſeek by force to regain
one to his Bed, that had ſo noto­riouſly wrong'd it. (Though this Example
wants not ſe­conds if we may credit Parthenius in Eroticis) But hear we
another Doctors opinion: with which we conclude:

Olim mirabar, quod tanti ad Pergama Belli

Europae, atque Aſiae cauſa puell [...] fuit.

[[Page]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=25) Nunc, Pari,
tu ſapiens, & tu, Menelae fuiſti:

Tu, quia ponebas; tu, quia lentus eras,

Digna quidem facies, pro qua vel obiret Achilles

Vel Priamus, belli Cauſa probandafuit.

Propert. l. 2. eleg. 3.

I wonder'd once, that Troy's War, which engag'd

Half the whole World, ſhould for a Wife be wag'd,

But now methinks both Princes I approve,

This 'cauſe he ſought, that 'cauſe he kept his Love.

Worthy Achilles, worthy Priams Life,

Was ſuch a Beauty: 'Twas a juſt brave ſtrife.

#### 1.4.3. The Rape of HELLEN, out of the Greek of Coluthus.

YE Trojan Nymphs! Xanthus fair Progeny!

Who on your Fathers Sands oft laying by

Your ſacred Armelets, and Heads reedy Tires,

Aſcend to dance on Ide in mixed Quires;

Quit your rough floud; and tell the Phrygian Swains

Juſt verdict: how the Hills he left, the Main's

New Toyls to undergo: his Mind what preſt

With fatall Ships both Sea, and Land t'infeſt;

Whence did that unexpected ſtrife ariſe,

Which made a Shepheard judge 'twixt Deities:

What was his bold Award; how to his Ear

Arriv'd the fair Greek's Name; for you were there:

And Paris thron'd in Ida's ſhades did ſee,

And Venus glorying in her Victory.

When tall Theſſalian Mountains the Delights

Witneſs'd of Peleus Hymenaeall Rites,

Ganymed Nectar at the ſacred Feaſt

By Jove's Command fill'd out to every Gueſt;

[[Page 48]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=27) For all
deſcended from caeleſtiall Race,

That day, with equall forwardneſs, to grace

Fair Thetis (Amphitrite's Siſter) ſtrove.

From Seas came Neptune, from the Heavens came Jove▪

And Phoebus from the Helicon [...]an ſpring,

Did the ſweet Conſort of the Muſes bring.

Next whom, the Siſter to the Thunderer

Majeſtick Juno came: nor did the Fair

Harmonia's Mother Venus ſtay behind;

Suada went too, who for the Bride entwin'd

The Wedding Garland, and Love's Quiver bare.

Pallas from Nuptials though averſe, was there;

Aſide her heavy Helmet having laid.

Apollo's ſiſter, the Latonian Maid,

(Though wholly to the ſavage Chace apply'd)

Her Preſence at this Meeting not deny'd.

Stern Mars, not ſuch as when his Spear he ſhakes,

But as when he to lovely Venus makes

His amorous Addreſs, (his Shield, and Lance

Thrown by) there ſmiling mix'd in a ſoft dance.

But thence unhonour'd Erys was debarr'd;

Nor Chyron her, nor Peleus, did regard.

But Bacchus ſhaking with his golden Hair

His dangling Grapes, let's Zephyre's ſportive Air

Play with his curled Treſſes: like ſome young

Heyfer, (which by a furious Gad-fly ſtung

Quitting the Fields, in ſhady Foreſts ſtraies)

Whilſt madded Erys roams: ſeeking alwaies,

How to diſturb the quiet of the Feaſt.

Oft from her rocky Cell (with rage poſſeſt)

She ſlings; now ſtands, then ſits: ſtill up and down

Groaping on th' Earth, yet could not find a ſtone:

For Lightning ſhee'd have ſtrook: or by ſome ſpell

The bold Titanean Brethren rais'd from Hell

[[Page 49]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=27) VVith
hoſtile-Flames to ſtorm Jove's ſtarry Fort;

Though thus enrag'd, ſhe yet does Vulcan court,

Whom Fire, and Malleable ſteel obeys:

She thought the ſound of clatt'ring ſhields to raiſe,

That ſo the Gods affrighted with the Noiſe

Might have run forth, and left their Feſtive Joys.

But fearing Mars, She does at laſt incline

To put in Act a far more quaint Deſign:

She cals to mind Heſperia's golden Fruit;

Whence a fair Apple of dire VVars the Root,

Pulling, the Cauſe of ſignall ſtrifes ſhe found:

Then midſt the Feaſt, Diſſentions fatall ground

Caſts, and diſturbs the Goddeſſes fair Quire.

Juno, of Joves Bed proud, does firſt admire

The ſhining Fruit, then challeng'd as her due:

But Venus (all ſurpaſſing) claims it too

As Love's Propriety: which by Jove ſeen,

He calls, then thus to Hermes, does begin.

Know'ſt thou not Paris, one of Priam's Sons?

VVho, where through Phrygian Grounds ſmooth Xa [...] ­thus runs,

Grazes his horned Heards, on Ida's Hill,

To him this Apple bear: ſay 'tis our Will,

As Arbiter of Beauty, he declare

VVhich of theſe Goddeſſes excells in rare

Conjunction of arch'd Eyebrows, lovely grace,

And well-proportion'd roundneſs of the Face;

And ſhe that ſeems the faireſt in his Eyes,

To have the Apple, as her Beauties prize.

This charge on Mercury, Saturnius laies,

VVho humbly his great Sires Commands obeys;

And with officious care Th' Immortals guides:

VVhilſt each her ſelf in her own Beauty prides,

But as they went: Loves ſubtle Queen, her heads

[...]ich Tire unlooſing, with gold Fillets breads

[[Page 50]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=28) Her
curious Hair; then thus, with Eyes intent

On her wing'd Sons, her troubled thoughts does vent.

The ſtrife is neer; deer Sons your Mother aide!

This day muſt crown my Beauty, or degrade.

And much I fear to whom this Clown will give

The golden fruit: Juno, all men beleeve

To be the Graces reverend Nurſe: to Her

The gift of Scepters they aſſign, in War

A powerfull Goddeſs is Minerva deem'd:

But We alone are of no Pow'r eſteem'd.

Nor Empires We, nor Martiall Arms beſtow:

Yet why without a cauſe thus fear We? though

Minervas ſpear We have not, We yet better

Are with our Caeſtus arm'd, ſweet Loves ſoft Fetter,

Our Caeſtus: that our Bow is, that our ſting,

Which ſmart to Women, but not death does bring.

Thus roſie-finger'd Venus on the Way

To her attending Cupids ſpake, whilſt they,

With dutious Words, their drooping Mother cheer.

And now they reach'd the Top of Ida; where

The youthfull Paris neer Ana [...]us head,

His Father's ſheep in Flocks divided fed:

Here of his roving Buls he count doth keep,

And there he reckons o'r his well-fed ſheep.

Low as his Knee, a Mountain Goats rough hide

Hung from his ſhoulders ſlagging by his ſide:

In's hand a Neatheards Goad: ſuch to the Eye

(As ſlowly to his Pipes ſoft Melody

He moves) appear'd the gentle Phrygian Swain:

Tuning on's Reed, a ſweet, though rurall ſtrain.

I'th' ſolitary ſtalls oft would he ſet

Himſelf with Songs delighting; and forget

The care both of his Heards and Flocks; the Praiſe

Of Pan and Hermes ſubject of his Layes,

[[Page 51]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=28) With
Shepheards moſt in uſe:) whoſe ſweeter Note

No Dogs rude Howl, no Bulls loud-bellowing Throat

Diſturbs; but Eccho only, that affords

An artleſs ſound in unarticulate Words.

His Oxen cloy'd with the rank Graſs, were layd,

Stretching their fat ſides in the cooler ſhade;

Under th' Umbrella of a ſpreading Tree

Whilſt he himſelf ſate ſinging: but when he

Spy'd Hermes with the Goddeſſes; afraid,

Upſtarting, from their ſight he would have made:

And, (his ſweet Pipe among the Buſhes flung)

Abruptly clos'd his ſcarce commenced Song.

To whom, amaz'd, thus Heavens wing'd Nuncius ſpake:

Caſt away fear; a while thy Flocks forſake,

Thou muſt in Judgement ſit; and freely tell

Which of theſe Pow'rs in Beauty does excell,

And to the faireſt this fair fruit preſent.

Thus he: when Paris, with Eyes mildly bent

In amorous Glances, of their Beauties took

Exact ſurvey: which had the gracefull'ſt Look,

The brighteſt Eyes, whoſe Neck the whiteſt skin,

Not leaving ought from Head, to Heel, unſeen.

To whom Minerva firſt her ſelf addreſt,

Then, taking by the hand, theſe Words expreſt.

Come hither Paris I leave Jove's Wife behind:

Nor Venus Preſident of Nuptials, mind.

Pallas of Valour the Directreſs praiſe:

Intruſted with large Rule and Power, Fame ſaies,

Thou govern'ſt Troy: Me chief for Form confeſs,

I'll make thee too its Guardian in diſtreſs.

Comply, and 'gainſt Bellona's dreadfull Harms

Secur'd, I'll teach thee the bold deeds of Arms.

Thus Pallas courted him: ſhe ſcarce had done

When with fair Words, and Looks, Juno begun.

[[Page 52]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=29) If me the
Prize of Beauty thou'lt aſſign,

The Empire of all Aſia ſhall be thine;

Slight Wars, what good from thence to Princes ſprings?

Both valiant men and Cowards ſtoop to Kings.

Nor doe Minerva's Followers oft riſe high,

But Servants rather to Bell [...]na dy:

This glorious Proffer ſtately Juno made.

But Venus (her large Veil unloos'd) diſplayd

Her whiter Boſome; nor at all was ſhy;

But did the honied Chain of Loves unty:

And, (whilſt to view ſhe her fai [...] Breaſts diſclos'd)

Thus ſpake; her Looks into ſweet ſmiles diſpos'd.

Our Beauty, Wars forgot, our Beauty prize,

And Empires and the Aſian Lands deſpiſe.

We know not Wars, nor uſe of Shields can tell;

In Beauty, Women rather ſhould excell;

For Valour, I'll to thee a Wife commend,

Stead of a Throne fair Hellens Bed aſcend.

A Spouſe, thee Troy and Sparta ſhall behold:

Scarce had ſhe ended, when the fruit of Gold

To Venus, as her Beauties noble Prize,

The Swain preſented; whence dire Wars did riſe.

Who in her hand as ſhe the Apple weigh'd,

Did Juno, and Minerva thus upbraid.

Yield me the Victory, yield me fair Friends!

Beauty I lov'd, and Beauty me attends [...]

Juno they ſay thou gav'ſt the Graces Life,

Yet they have all forſook thee in this ſtrife,

Though thou to Mars and Vulcan Mother art,

Nor Mars nor Vulcan did their Aid impart;

Though this in Flames, that glory in his Spear,

Yet neither one nor other helpt thee here.

How thou braggd'ſt too, who from no Mothers wombe

But Jove's cleft Skull, the Birth of Steel, didſt come?

[[Page 53]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=29) In Armour
how thy Limbs are dreſt? how Love

Thou ſhunn'ſt, and doſt the Toyls of Mars approve?

Alike to Peace and Wedlock oppoſite.

Minerva! know, that ſuch for glorious Fight

Are much unfit, whom by their Limbs, none well

Whether they Men, or Women be, can tell.

Sad Pallas thus, proud of her Victory,

She flouts, and her, and Juno both puts by,

Whilſt ſhe the fatall Prize of Beauty won.

Inflam'd with Love, hot in purſuit of one

To him unknown; with inauſpicious Fate,

Men skill'd in Architecture, Paris ſtrait

To a dark Wood conducts; where, in a Trice,

Tall Oaks are fell'd by Phereclus Advice,

Of Ills the Author, who before to pleaſe

His fond King Ships had built; whilſt for the Seas

Paris does Ida change; and on the ſhore

With frequent Pray'rs, and Sacrifice, implore

His kind Aſſiſtant, Queen of Marriage vows;

Then the broad Back of Helleſpo [...]tus ploughs.

But ſad preſaging Omens did appear:

Seas riſing to the Skyes, did either Bear

And of the Walk which oft ſh [...] came and went,

Near cleer Eurotas, with rare Beauties grac'd:

Not far from whence, under a ſhady Wood,

H' admiring ſaw how ſweet Therapnae ſtood.

For now but a ſhort Cut he had to ſail,

Nor long was heard the daſh of Oars: They hale

The Ship to ſhore, and with ſtrong Haulſers ty'd;

When Paris with cleer water purifi'd,

Upon his Tiptoes lightly treads▪ for fear

His lovely feet he with the Duſt ſhould ſmear,

Or going haſtily▪ his Hair which flows

Beneath his Hat, the Winds ſhould diſcompoſe.

By this, the ſtately Buildings, drawing nigher

He views, the Neighbouring Temples that aſpire,

And Cities ſplendour: where with wondring Eyes

The Statue of their Pallas he eſpies,

All of pure Gold; from which, his roving ſight

Next Hyacinthus Image does invite;

The Boy with whom Apollo us'd to play:

VVhom leſt Latona ſhould have rapt away

(Diſpleas'd with Jove) the Amyclaeans fear'd.

Phoebus from envious Zephyre, who appear'd

His Rivall, could not yet ſecure the Boy:

But Earth t'appeaſe the ſad Kings Tears, his Joy,

A Flow'r produc'd; a Flow'r, that doth proclame

Of the once lovely Youth, the ſtill-lov'd Name.

Now near Atrides Court, before the Gates,

Bright in caeleſtiall Graces Paris waites.

Not Seme [...]e a Youth ſo lovely bare:

(Your Pardon Bacchus! though Joves Son you are)

[[Page 55]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=30) Such
Beauty did his Looks irradiate.

But Hellen the Court doors unbolting ſtrait,

VVhen 'fore the Hall the Trojan ſhe had ſeen

And throughly mark'd, kindly invites him in,

And ſeats him in a Silver Chair; her Eyes

VVhilſt on his Looks ſhe feeds, not ſatisfies.

Firſt ſhe ſuppos'd he Venus Son might be,

Yet when his quiver'd Shafts ſhe did not ſee

She knew he was not Love; but by the ſhine

Of his bright Looks thought him the God of VVine.

At length her VVonder in theſe VVords did break.

VVhence art my Gueſt? thy Stock, thy County ſpeak;

For Majeſty is printed in thy Face:

And yet thou ſeem'ſt not of the Argive Race.

Of ſandy Pylos ſure thou canſt not be,

I know Antilochus, but know not thee.

Nor art of Phthia which ſtout Men doth breed,

I know all Aeacus renowned Seed;

The glorious Peleus, and his warlike Son,

Courteous Patroclus, and ſtout  [...]elamon:

Thus Hellen curious to be ſatisfi'd,

Queſtions her Gueſt; who fairly thus reply'd.

If thou of Troy in Phrygia's utmoſt bound,

By Neptune, and Apollo walled round,

And of a King from Saturn ſprung, who there

Now fortunately rules, didſt ever hear,

His Son am I; and all within his ſway,

To me, as chief next him▪ ſubjection pay.

From Dardanus am I deſcended, he

From Jove; where Gods, immortal though they be

Do oft ſerve Mortals: who beguirt our Town

Round with a VVall, a VVall that ne'r ſhall down.

I am great Queen! the Judge of Goddeſſes,

VVhom though diſpleas'd, I cenſur'd, and of theſe

[[Page 56]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=31) The
lovely Venus Beauty did prefer:

For which, in noble Recompence, by her

Promis'd a VVife, her Siſter, Hellen nam'd.

For whom theſe Troubles I through Seas ſuſtain'd,

Since Venus bids, hert let us ſolemnize

Our Nuptiall Rites; Me nor my Bed deſpiſe;

On what is known, inſiſt we need not long

Thy Spouſe from an unwarlike Race is ſprung:

Thou all the Graecian Dames doſt far outvy,

Beautious thy Looks are, theirs, their Sex belye.

At this ſhe fix'd on Earth her lovely Eyes▪

And doubtfull, paws'd a while, at length replies.

Your Wals my Gueſt! by hands Caeleſtiall rais'd,

And Paſtures, where his Heards Apollo graz'd,

I long to ſee: To Troy bear me away.

I'l follow thee, and Venus will obey;

Nor, there, will Menelaus anger heed;

Thus Paris, and the beautious Nymph agree'd.

Now Night the eaſe of Cares, the Day quite ſpent,

Sleep brought, ſuſpended by the Morns Aſcent,

Of Dreams the two Gates opening: this of Horn,

In which the Gods unerring Truths are born.

T'other of Ivory: whence couzening Lies,

And vain Deluſions of falſe Dreams ariſe.

When from Atrides Hoſpitable Court

Paris through plough'd Seas Hellen does tranſport,

And in the gift of Venus proudly joy;

Bearing with ſpeed the Fraight of War to Troy.

Hermione, ſoon as the Morn appears,

To Winds her torn Veyl caſting, big with Tears,

Her loſs bewails; and from her Chamber flying,

With grief diſtraught, thus to her Maids ſpake, crying.

Whither without me is my Mother fied?

Who lay with me laſt Night in the ſame Bed?

[[Page 57]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=31) And with
her own hand lockt the Chamber door?

Thus ſpake ſhe weeping: All the Maids deplore

With her their Miſtreſs abſence; yet aſſay

With theſe kind Words her Paſſion to allay.

Why doſt thou weep ſweet Child! thy Mother's gon,

But will return ſoon as ſhe hears thy Moan.

See how thy Tears have blubber'd thy fair Cheeks!

Much weeping the divineſt Beauty breaks.

She 'mongſt the Virgins is but gon to play,

And comming back perhaps hath miſs'd her way:

And in ſome flowry Medow doubtfull ſtands;

Or in Eurotas bath'd, ſports on his Sands.

The weeping Child replyes; the Hill, Brook, Walk,

And Fields ſhe knows; doe not ſo idly talk:

The Stars doe ſleep, yet on cold Rocks ſhe lies;

The Stars awake, and yet ſhe does not riſe.

O my dear Mother! where doſt thou abide?

Upon what Mountains barren Top reſide?

Hath ſome wild Beaſt alas! thee wandring ſlain;

(Yet from Joves Royall Blood wild Beaſts refrain)

Or fall'n from ſome ſteep Precipice, art layd

An unregarded Corſe in ſome dark ſhade?

And yet in ev'ry Grove, at ev'ry Tree,

Search have I made, but cannot meet with Thee.

The Woods we blame not then; nor doe profound

Furota's gentle ſtreams conceal thee drown'd:

For in deep Floods the Naiades doe uſe,

Nor e'r by them their Lives doe VVomen loſe.

Thus poor Hermione complaining wept,

Then tow'rd her ſhoulder her head leaning, ſlept.

(Sleep is Deaths Twin, and as the younger Brother,

In every thing doth imitate the other;

Hence 'tis that VVomen often when they weep,

O'recharg'd with their own ſorrows, fall aſleep)

[[Page 58]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=32) VVhen in
a Dream, her Mother (as ſhe thought)

Seeing, ſhe cries, vex'd, yet with fear diſtraught:

From me diſconſolate laſt night you fled,

And left me ſleeping in my Fathers Bed.

VVhat Hill, what Mountain have I left untrac'd?

To Venus pleaſing Ties mak'ſt thou ſuch haſte?

To whom fair Tyndaris this Anſwer made:

Daughter! though griev'd, me yet forbear t' upbraid:

That treacherous Stranger, who the other Day

Came hither, carry'd me by force away.

Thus ſhe: at which out ſtrait Hermione flies.

But finding not her Mother, louder cries;

VVing'd Iſſue of th' Inhabitants of Air,

Ye Birds! to Menalaus ſtrait declare,

One late arriving at the Spartan Port,

Ha [...]h rob'd him of the Glory of his Court.

Thus to regardleſs VVinds did ſhe complain,

Seeking her abſent Mother, but in vain.

Mean-time, through Thracian Towns, and Helles ſtrait

Paris arriv'd ſafe with his beautious Fraight,

VVhen from the Caſtle, viewing on the ſhore

A new gueſt Land, her hair Caſſandra tore.

But Troy with open Gates her welcome ſhows

To the returning Author of her VVoes.

When tall Theſſalian Mountains the delights

Witneſs'd of Peleus Hymenaeall Rites.]

The Poets fabled that Peleus, the ſonne of Aeacus, and pupill of Chiron,
married Thetis the daughter of Nereus in the Mountain Pelion, and that all the
Gods did him the honour to grace his Nuptials with their Preſence; The [[Page
61]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=33) ground of which
Fiction the Scholiaſt of Ariſtophanes, (in Nubibus) hath after this manner
diſcovered: So in­dulgent was Chiron to his Pupill Peleus, that he ſtudied by
all poſſible meanes to advance the Honour of his Name. He therefore
endeavoured, and at laſt concluded a Match betwixt him and Philomela the
Daughter of Actor the Myrmidon, a Lady of incomparable Beauty, but gave it out
that ſhe was Thetis, whom by Joves conſent, Peleus was ſhortly to marry, and
that all the Gods would deſcend to his Wedding in ſhowers of Rain: Whereupon,
having made choice of a Time which by his conjecture (as he was notably well
verſt that way) was like to prove very ſhowry, he appoints the Conſummation of
the in­tended Nuptials; and the ſeaſon proving as he expected, the Rumor was
verily beleev'd by the ignorant vulgar, and increaſt in ſucceeding Times by
the Fictions of the Poets. From whence we may likewiſe collect this fur­ther
Morall: Thetis (by Mythologiſts) is taken for the Wa­ter, married by Jupiter,
i.e. fire or the Calor Naturalis, to Peleus or Earth, whence is produc'd
Mankind ( [...] Ariſtoph.) All the Gods come to the Wedding, be­cauſe every
Part of the Body is attributed to ſome parti­cular Deity (as the Head to
Jupiter, Eyes to Minerva, Armes to Juno. &c.) except Eris or Contention;

Though this Fable hath been already ſufficiently ex­plained by us; yet (for

Bello Tro­jano c. 6.) Ea tempeſtate (ſpeaking of the Nuptials of Peleus and
Thetis) multi undique Reges aviti, domum Chironis, filiam ipſas Epulas

Eminent Per­ſonages, of which Statius (in Epithalam. Stell. & Vio­lantill.)
affords us not an unelegant Example.

Juno, they ſay, thou ga [...]'ſt the Graces life.]

Our Author here makes Juno the mother of the Graces: Heſiod (in Theogon.)
Jupiter and Eurynome their Parents: Antimachus will have them the daughters of
Sol and Egle: (Pauſan. in Boeotic.) Servius (in 6. Aeneid.) of Bac­chus and
Venus: Theſe were in number three; their names Aglaia, Euphroſyne, Thalia. Yet
both their names and number I find controverted: the Lacedemonians
acknow­ledging onely two, by the name of Auxo, and Hegemon, (Pauſ. Boeot.)
Homer but one, whom he makes the wife of Vulcan) quod gratioſa ſint Mechanica
opera, ſaith Phor­nutus:) yet he names Paſiphae likewiſe for one of the
Graces, whom Juno promiſes to Somnus for his Bride: but ſee the common
received Fable (and that moralized) in Seneca, in 1. de beneficiis.

[[Page 76]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=41)

Though thou to Mars and Vulcan Mother art

Nor one nor other did their aid impart.]

I know not how Mars may be excuſed: but Vulca [...] had little reaſon to help
ſo unnatural a mother as Juno, who is ſaid to have thrown him to earth from
heaven▪ when newly born, for his deformity: (the Phyſical▪ ſence of which,
Lucretius in 5. de rerum natura tels us, is no o­ther then that

Fulmen detulit in terras mortalibus ignem

Primitus; inde omnis Flammarum diditur ardor.)

Nor would ſhe ever acknowledge him for hers, until ſuch time as having made a
chair of gold with ſuch in­ward ſprings, that whoever ſate therein was catch't
as in a Trap: he ſent the ſame for a preſent to Juno, who ſitting down therein
was taken faſt in the private ſnares, and de­nied by Vulcan to be ſet at
liberty, until ſuch time as ſhe would diſcover unto him who were his parents,
where­upon Juno declaring the truth of the buſineſs, ſhe was ſet free, and he
admitted into the number and ſociety of the Gods. See Pauſan▪ in Attic. and
Servius in 5. Ec­log. Virgil.

Iſmarus is a mountain of Thrace, and a Maritime Ci­ty of the ſame Region, in

plundered by Ʋlyſſes in his return from Troy, as he himſelf confeſſes:

Pangaeus according to Pliny, is a mountain of Thrace.

Phillis riſing Monument.]

The reaſon of this Epithite Heinſius gives (in Crepund. Silian. l. 15.) where
he writes: Sepulchra ſua in grati­am viatorum, Nautarumque in Mari errantium,

Phocus, made himſelf Lord of.

Mycene.]

A City in the Argive Territories, whoſe founder Perſe­us is ſaid to be; ſo
called, for that the pummel of his ſword hilt (which in the Greek is  [...],
by which word likewiſe they denoted a Muſh-room, or Toad-ſtool) fell off
there▪ (Pauſ▪ in Corinth.) I have heard likewiſe (ſaith  [...]he) that▪
Perſeus being very thirſty, and pulling up a Muſh­roem [[Page
80]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=43) by chance, there
ſuddenly guſhed out of the place a clear ſpring of running waters; with which
having quenched his thirſt, to his no little pleaſure, he from that accident
called the City he built there, Mycene: though there be others that will have
Mycenus the ſon of Sparto, or Mycene the Daughter of Inachus, to give name to
it; which opinions Pauſanias yet rejects.

Erymanthus]

Pauſan. Arcad. [...]. i. e. Erymanthus hath his Fountain in the hill Lampea,
ſacred to Pan; ſome part perhaps of the Mountain Erymanthus, (whence the river

Pauſanias writes) ſo called  [...], from Therapne the Daughter of Lelex.
Lacon.

Beneath his hat.]

The Scholiaſt of Ariſtophanes, [...]. In Peloponneſus they call a Hat Cunea,
from the wearing of which Mercury is named Cunes. But Eu­ſtathius expreſly
avers, that the Greeks in Homers time, went bare headed: Feſtus may reconcile
this difference, who ſaith, The antients gave hats to Caſtor and Pollux,
becauſe they were Lacedaemonians, quib [...]s pileatis pug­nare in more
poſitum: quo indomitum animum adver­ſus Barbaros Reges & Tyrannos,
ſignificationem libertatis, oſtentarent, Pier. Hierogl. lib. 40. So that I
conceive here is meant rather ſuch kind of Helmets as by Vegetius are
deſcribed: Pilei, quos Pannonicos vocant, ex pellibus.

Phoebus from envious Zephyre (who appear'd

His Rival) could not yet ſecure the boy.]

The ſtory is thus related by Apollo to Mercury in Luci­an (dialog. (Mercurij &
Apollo.) [...]. i. e. He learnt (to wit Hyacinthus) to play at Hurlebats, and
I plaid with him. [[Page
82]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=44) But the moſt
pernicious of all the Winds, Zephyrus, lov'd him too, and had done ſo for a
long time; but being ſlighted, and not brooking to be diſdain'd; he, whileſt
we (as our cuſtom was) plaid together, and I toſt the Hurlebat on high,
blowing from the top of Taygetus, drove it directly againſt the Boyes head
with ſuch vio­lence, that the bloud ſtrait ſprung from the wound, and the Boy
immediately dyed.

—But th' Earth

A Flowre produc'd that doth proclaim

Of the once lovely youth the ſtill lov'd name.]

In the ſame Dialogue Apollo thus goes on,  [...]. i. e. But of the bloud that
was ſhed, I cauſed the earth to produce a flowre, the faireſt (Mer­cury) and
moſt fragrant of all others, which carries cer­tain letters in its leaves,
that do (as it were) deplore his death. Of which, ſee Ovid. l. Metam. 10. &
13\. Moſchus in Epituph. Bion. Pliny l. 21. c. 11. & 26\. Dioſcorides takes it
to be the Vaccinium of the Latines, retaining ſome ſimilitude of name: and ſo
interpreted by Servius on this verſe of Virgil,

Alba liguſtra cadunt, vaccinia nigra leguntur.

Pylos.]

Pauſ. (in Meſſeniacis) [...]. The Pylian fields are for the moſt part ſandy, &
afford little paſturage for cattel. Homer teſti­fies as much, who ſpeaking of
Neſtor, ſtiles him alwaies the King of ſandy Pylos. Eustathius upon Homer
reckons up three ſeveral Towns of the ſame name; the firſt in Meſſenia, where
Neſtor reigned; the ſecond in Arcadia, where Neſtor was born; the third in
Elis, near to the Olenian Promontory. This of Meſſenia is now called
Na­varinum, where yet ſtands a ſtrong Caſtle (ſubject, as is all Peloponneſus,
to the Turk) upon a riſing ground, ſtretching into the ſea, whereinto it hath
a large Pro­ſpect, and a fair Haven, as the Author of the Turkiſh Hi­ſtory
tells me.

Aeacus was the ſon of Jupiter and Aegina; whoſe ſons were Phocus, Peleus,
Teucer, and Telamon.

Patroclus.]

[...].—(Homer paſſim in Illad. [...] & [...].) Menaetius valiant ſon, and the
beloved aſſociate of Achilles; by birth an Opuntian: who having at play
ca­ſually ſlain Clyſomnius the ſon of Amphidamus, a youth of equal years with
himſelf, being baniſhed his Coun­trey, and coming to Phthia, was kindly
entertainted by [[Page
84]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=45) Peleus, and
brought up by him as a companion for his ſon Achilles: which beſides Homer in
Iliad. [...]. Ovid in theſe verſes teſtifies,

Caede puer factâ Patroclus Opunta reliquit,

Theſſalicam (que) adijt Hoſpes Achilles humum.

Stout Telamon.]

Not here to be taken for one of Phthia, though happily our Author (at firſt
ſight) may ſeem to infer as much; for (as I have before noted)

— [...],

[...].

Apollo [...]. l. 1.

—Telamon in Salamis did reign,

But Peleus apart in Phthia dwelt.

By Neptune and Apollo walled round.]

Yet Neptune in Homer (Iliad.  [...].) affirms that he only wall'd it.

[...],

[...].

I onely Troy with a fair wall did round,

That it impregnable might ſtill be found.

Being hired to that end for a year by Laomedon, as Apollo was to keep his
Oxen: as Homer in the ſame place tells us, and our Author likewiſe at verſe ()
following, plain­ly intimates. But Pindar (Olymp. 8.) reports that part of it
was wall'd by Aeacus,

[...]

From Dardanus am I deſcended.]

It is not perhaps commonly taken notice of, that this Dardanus was a famous
Magician. Apuleius in Apolog. Ego ille ſim vel Charinondas, vel Damigeron, vel
is Mo­ſes, vel Jannes, vel Apollonius, vel ipſe Daidanus, vel quicunque poſt

Muſaeus,  [...].

And (with little difference) Virgil, ‘Diva ſolo fixos oculos averſa tenebat.’

A ſign of baſhfulneſs, or deliberation. Vide Barthij Adver­ſaria. ‘Of Dreams
the two Gates opening.]’

The Antients (as both Philostratus and the Anonymus Author of Hieroglyphical
Collections reportes) painted ſleep like a man heavy with ſlumber, his under
garment white, his upper black, thereby expreſſing Day and Night; holding in
his hand a Horn, ſometimes really ſuch, ſometimes of Ivory in the likeneſs of
one, through which they feign'd that he conveyd dreams: true, when the ſame
was of Horn; falſe, when of Ivory. To which Vir­gil in 6. Aeneid. and our
Author here allude, (as before them Homer in 19. Odyſſ.) The reaſon of which
Fiction▪ take from Macrobius (in Somn. Scip.) as more pertinent [[Page
86]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=46) in my opinion,
than that Expoſition which Servius gives, where he writes much to this effect.
There is a veil drawn between our Intellect and Truth, yet this the ſoul (when
freed from the diſtempers of the body by ſleep) oft-times per­ceives, but
darkly, and as it were through a cloudy medium, ſignified by the horn, of
colour black, yet of a diaphanous na­ture: but when there is ſuch a veil drawn
over it, that the eyes of the minde can no way penetrate it, it is ſaid to be
of Ivory, whoſe nature is ſuch, that though wrought to never ſo extream a
thinneſs, it cannot poſſibly be made pellucid. Having given you this ſerious
Mythologie of the Fable, it will not be amiſs to conclude with this lighter
alluſion of Manno's.

Homer in 14. & 16\. Iliad. whence Seneca in Hercule fu­rente borrowed this
expreſſion,

Frater durae languide mortis.

For they both had the ſame parents, Erebus and Night, according to Heſiod in
Theogonia: Pauſanias (in Eliaco­rum 1.) reports that he ſaw at Elis, the
picture of a wo­man holding in her left arm a white, in her right a black
child, the one expreſſing death, the other ſleep; the wo­man her ſelf
repreſenting night, the nurſe of both. The reaſon of which faigned Twinſhip,
Athenagoras thus gives:  [...]. i. e. For this cauſe I ſuppoſe ſome call
ſleep, the brother of death, not as deriving their genealogie from the ſame
parents, but from the ſame accidents which hap­pen to thoſe that ſleep and
dye; as their inſenſibleneſs of external occurrences, and their own being.

My ſcarf.—Child, you muſt ſtay at home: there's ſprites

Where we are going, and a horſe that bites.

Nay, cry (and th' woo't) as long as thou canſt ſcream,

I care not: doſt thou think I'le ſee thee lame?

Come,—

To Eu­noa.

take the boy, and play with him: d'ee hear!

Call the Dog in, and make the dore faſt.—Dear

What a huge crowd's here! how ſhall we get by?

They ſwarm like Ants. O noble Ptolomy!

[[Page 94]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=50) Many a
good deed ſince thy Fathers daies

We ow thee thanks for. Free are now the waies

From Thieves and Murtherers: no Rogues flock together

To act their cheats now, like birds of a Feather.

But which way now? there's the Horſe-guard before us.

Pray friend be fair condition'd; don't ride or'e us.

O, he curvets; 'tis a fierce horſe that Bay;

Hee'l throw his Rider, let's get out o'th way:

Run Eunoe:—I'm glad yet I have made

The boy keep home.

Gorgo.

Come, courage; ben't afraid:

They'r paſt us now.

Prax.

And ſo's my fright: good Lord!

A Horſe and Snake are two things I've abhorr'd

Even from a child:—but haſte, or elſe another

Shole will or'etake us.

Gorgo.

Come you from Court, Mother?

Old Woman.

Yes, my good Daughter.

Gorgo.

Pray, may one get in?

Old Woman.

The Greeks did Troy by their endeavours win:

Endeavour will do all things.

Gorgo.

S'lid th' old Crone

Speaks Oracles. To woman what's unknown?

How Jove wood Juno they can tell. But ſee,

Before the Gate what ſtore of company?

Prax.

A world! Gorgo, thy hand: Eutychides,

[[Page 95]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=50) Lend
Eunoa thine, leaſt ſhe be loſt i'th' preſs.

Let's all crowd in together: Eunoe,

Be ſure you keep your hold. Gorgo, Ah me!

My ſcarfe's rent quite in two: good Sir, for love

Of Heaven, help ſave my ſcarf there.

Stranger.

'Tis above

My power to do it: yet I'le do my beſt.

Prax.

They thruſt like Swine: how vildely are we preſt!

Stranger.

Come, come, w'are well now: take a good heart.

Prax.

May it be ever ſo with thee, that art

So kind to us: an honeſt civil man:

But O, they crowd as bad as e're again.

Help, help alas! thruſt Eunoa for thy life.

So, now w'are in, as the man ſaid to's wife.

Gorgo.

Come, look upon theſe Hangings firſt; ſo fair,

As if the handy work of Gods they were.

Prax.

Bleſs me! what Artiſt made them of ſo fine

A Woof? what Painter could ſo well deſign?

They ſeem to move: ſure they're alive, not wrought:

Lord! Lord! the wit of man ſurpaſſes thought.

But ſee how lovely on a ſilver bed

(His tender cheeks with a ſoft down o're ſpread)

Adonis lies! how admirably fair!

With whom the powers of Hell enamour'd are.

2d. Stranger.

Peace, fooliſh tatling women; hold your prate:

Your wide mouth'd Dorick here is out of date.

Gergo.

[[Page 96]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=51)

Gup: who art thou? what is our talk to thee?

Correct your maids, not us of Sicilie:

Yet (would you knew't) we are from Corinth ſprung,

As was Bellerophon: our Mother Tongue

Peloponneſian is: nor is it ſcorn

That they ſpeak Dorick, who are Dorick born.

Prax.

More Lords then one, Sir, we diſclaim:

Ye need not faith: here's thoſe care little for't.

Whiſt! whiſt Pr [...]xi [...]e! The Hymn let's hear▪

Thy joy: ſweet Venus! ſee the ſoft pac't hours

Thy dear Adonis from th'Infernal powers

Have brought again at the years end to thee!

Though ſlowest of the Deities they be,

Yet they come wiſh'd for, and with ſomething fraug [...]

Alwaies to  [...]ll. Thou whom Dione brought

To light, fair Cypris! Berenice's ſaid,

Mortal, by thee to be Immortall made,

And fed with ſweet Ambroſia: wherefore now,

Her daughter (to make good her grateful vow

To thee) her Daughter who for form may be

[[Page 97]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=51) A ſecond
Heli [...]) fair Arſinoe,

To thy Adonis choiſeſt gifts aſsigns;

O thou, that glorieſt in thy  [...]erous ſhrines!

The ſeveral fruits which laden Top-boughs yeild

Beſide him lie: here flowers of every field

In Silver Baskets: there Gold Boxes ſtand

Full of Aſſyrian unguents: On this hand,

All ſorts of rare Confections; and with thoſe,

What e're of Oyl or Hony we compoſe.

All Fo [...]ls, all beaſts for food: green Arbours dreſt

With ſoft Dil branches, where Loves make their neſt:

And like young Nightingales that have but now

New try'd their wings, flutter from bough to bough.

O the golds ſplendor! the pure Ivories too!

The Eagle with Joves Cup-bearer that flew!

And Purple Carpets then ſleep ſofter! may

The wondring Samian, and Mileſian ſay.

Here on a rich Bed doth Adonis lie;

And lovely Venus on another by.

Soft are his kiſſes, and his lips ſtill red;

Venus, now joy in his regained Bed.

Fo [...] we to morrow, e're the dew's exhal'd,

With hairs unbound, looſe garments, breſts unveild,

Him to the foaming waves that waſh the ſhore,

Shall bear from hence, and with ſad ſongs deplore.

The way from Hell (Adonis) unto thee

Is ever open, though to none elſe free

Of all the glorious Heroes (as they tell)

This ne'r t'Atrides, Ajax ne're befel.

Not Hector, chief of Hecub's numerous Race,

[[Page 98]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=52)
Patroclus, Pyrrhus, thoſe of elder daies,

The Lapithites, Deucalions iſſue; nor

The Sons of Pelops, (Princes fam'd in War)

Nor Argive Kings could er'e to this attain.

Be now appeas'd: and the next year again

Bring gladneſs with thee: ſtill propitious prove,

And as thou cam'ſt, return to us in love.

Gorgo.

O deer! what a rare woman's this? what choice

Of knowledge hath ſhe? and how ſweet a voice?

But go:—My husband's faſting ſtill, and then

He eats his own Gall: Fear a hungry man.

Fare-well Adonis for this time; and when

The year's done, come, and make us glad agen.

[[Page 99]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=52)

### 2.2. THE SUN-RISE.

THou youthfull Goddeſs of the Morn!

Whoſe Bluſh they in the Eaſt adore;

Daughter of Phoebus! who before

Thy all-enlightning Sire art born!

Haſte! and reſtore the day to me,

That my Loves beautious Object I may ſee.

Too much of time the night devours,

The Cocks ſhrill voice calls thee again;

Then quickly mount thy golden Wain

Drawn by the ſoftly-ſliding hours:

And make apparent to all eyes

With what Enamel thou doſt paint the skies.

Leave thy old husband, let him lie

Snorting upon his downy bed;

And to content thy Lover, ſpread

Thy Flames new lighted, through the sky;

Heark how thy preſence he conjures,

As leading to the Woods his Hounds, he lures.

Moiſten the fallow grounds before

Thou com'ſt, with a ſweet dewie rain;

That thirſtie Ceres having ta'ne

Her Mornings draught, that day no more

May call for drink; and we may ſee

Spangled with pearlie drops each buſh and tree.

[[Page 100]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=53)

Ah! now I ſee the ſweeteſt dawn!

Thrice welcome to my longing fight!

Heil divine beautie! Heavenly light!

I ſee thee through yon Cloud of Lawn

Appear; and as thy ſtar does glide,

Blanching with raies the Eaſt on every ſide.

Dull ſilence, and the drowſie King

Of ſad and Meloncholie Dreams,

Now flie before thy cheerful Beams,

The darkeſt ſhadows vanquiſhing:

The Owl, that all the night did keep

A houting, now is fled and gone to ſleep.

But all thoſe little Birds, whoſe noats

Sweetly the liſtning ear enthrall,

To the clear waters murmuring fall,

Accord their diſagreeing throats,

The luſtre of that greater Star

Praiſing, to which thou art but Harbinger.

'Bove our Horizon ſee him ſcale

The firſt point of his brighter Round!

O how the ſwarthie Aethiop's bound

With reverence to his light to veil,

And love the colour of his look,

Which from a heat ſo mild, ſo pure he took.

A God perceivable is he

By humane ſenſe, Natures bright eye,

Without whom all her works would die,

Or in their births imperfect be:

He Grace and Beautie gives alone,

To all the Works of her Creation.

[[Page 101]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=53)

With holie Reverence inſpir'd,

When firſt the day renews it's light,

The Earth, at ſo Divine a ſight,

Seems as if all on Altar fir'd,

Reeking with Perfumes to the skies,

Which ſhe preſents, her Native Sacrifice.

The humble Shepherd to his Raies,

Having his Ruſtick Homage paid,

And to ſome cool retired ſhade

Driven his bleating Flocks to Graze;

Sits down, delighted with the ſight

Of that great Lamp, ſo milde, ſo fair, ſo bright.

The Eagle in her Airy ſitting

Spreading her wings, with fixed eye

Gazes on his, t'whoſe Deitie

She yields all Adoration fitting:

As to the only quickning fire,

And Object that her eye does moſt deſire.

The Salmon (which at Spring forſakes

T [...]tis ſa [...]t Waves) to look on him;

Upon the waters top doth ſwim:

And to expreſs the joy he takes,

As ſportingly along he ſails,

Mocks the poor Fiſher with his ſilver Scales.

The Bee through flowrie Gardens goes

Buzzing to drink the mornings tears;

And from the early Lilly bears

A kiſs, commended to the Roſe;

And like a wary Meſſenger,

Whiſpers ſome Amor [...]s ſtory in her  [...]ar.

[[Page 102]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=54)

At which, ſhee rowſing from her ſleep,

Her chaſter Flames ſeems to declare

To him again, (whil'ſt Dew her fair

And bluſhing leaves in tears doth ſteep)

The ſorrow which her heart doth waſte,

That ſhee's ſo far from her dear Lover plac't.

And further ſeems, as if this plaint

In her mute Dialect ſhe made:

"Alas! I ſhall with ſorrow fade,

"And pine away in this reſtraint,

"Unleſs my too too rigorous Fate,

"My Conſtant faithful Love commiſerate.

"Love having gain'd the victory

"Over my ſoul, there acts his harms,

"Nor Thorns ſo many bear my Arms,

"As in my heart now prickles be:

"The onely Comfort I can give

"My ſelf, is this; I have not long to live.

"But if ſome courteous Virgin ſhall,

"Pitying my Fate, pull my ſweet flowre,

"E're by a ſad and fatal hour

"My Honours fade away and fall;

"I nothing more ſhall then deſire,

"But gladly without murmuring expire.

Peace ſweeteſt Queen of Flowres! now ſee

Sylvia, Queen of my Love, appear:

Who for thy Comfort brings with her

What will thy wiſhes ſatisfie;

For her white hand intends to grace thee,

And in her ſweeter Breſt, ſweet flower to place thee.

FINIS.

[[Page 95]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=54)

### 2.3. The Night: OR, The fair Mourner.

THis fair, and animated Night

In Sables dreſt▪ whoſe Curls of Light

Are with a ſhade of Cypreſſe veil'd;

Not from the Stygian Deeps exhal'd,

But from Heaven's bright Balcone came;

Not dropping Dew, but ſhedding Flame,

The bluſhing Eaſt her ſmiles diſplay,

Her beauteous Front the Dawn of Day;

The Stars doe ſparkle in her Eyes,

And in her Looks the Sun doth riſe.

No mask of Clouds and Storms ſhe wears,

But ſtill ſerene and calm appears:

No diſmall Birds, no hideous Fiends,

Nor charming Hag on her attends;

The Graces are her Maids of Honour,

And thouſand Cupids wait upon her.

Dear Flames! ſtill burning, though you are

Suppreſt: Lights, though obſcur'd, ſtill fair!

What Heart does not adore you? who,

But ſighs, or languiſhes for you?

Heaven wiſhes, by your ſhade outvy'd,

It's milky Path in Ink were dy'd:

The Sun within an Ebon Caſe,

Longs to ſhut up his golden [...] Face:

The Moon too with thy ſad Dreſſe took,

Would fain put on a mourning Look.

[[Page 96]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=55) Sweet
Night! and if th'art Night, of Peace

The gentle Mother! Cares Releaſe!

My Heart, now long oppreſt, relieve;

And in thy ſofter Boſome give

My weary Limbs a ſhort Repoſe;

'Tis but a ſmall Requeſt, Heaven knows:

Nor think it ſhame to condiſcend,

For Night is ſtil'd the Lovers Friend.

But Muſe, thou art too loud I fear,

The Night loves ſilence, Muſe forbear.

### 2.4. I SOSPIRI.  
Sighs.

SIghs! light, warm Spirits! in which, Air,

And Fire, poſſeſſe an equall ſhare:

The Souls ſoft Breath! Loves gentle Gales!

Which from Griefs Golfe (when all elſe failes)

Can by a ſpeedy Courſe, and ſhort,

Conduct the Heart to it's ſweet Port:

Ye flattering Zephyrs! by whoſe Pow'r,

Rais'd on the Wings of thought, each How'r

From the Abyſſe of Miſeries

To her Lov'd Heav'n the freed Soul flies.

True lively ſparks of that cloſe Fire,

Which Hearts conceal, and Eyes inſpire:

Chaſt Lamps that burn at Beauties ſhrine,

Whoſe purer Flames let none confine:

Nature a warmth unto my Heart,

Does not ſo kind as yours impart;

And if by Breath preſerv'd alive,

By your Breath only I ſurvive.

[[Page 97]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=55)

Loves faithfull Witneſſes! the Brief,

But true Expreſſes of our Grief!

Embaſſadors of mute Deſires!

Dumb Rhetorick which our Thoughts attires!

Grief, when it overloads the Breſt,

Is in no other language dreſt;

For you the ſuffering Lovers Flame,

Sweet, toungleſſe Orators, proclame.

A numerous Deſcant upon Sorrow!

Which ſweetnes doth from ſadnes borrow,

VVhen Love two differing Hearts accords,

And Joy, in well-tun'd Grief, affords.

The Muſick of whoſe ſweet Concent,

In a harmonious Languiſhment,

Does ſoftly fall, and gently riſe,

'Till in a broken Cloze, it dies.

Nature, and all that call her Mother,

In Sighs diſcourſe to one another:

Theirs, Nightingals, and Doves, in Tones

Different expreſſe; this ſings, that grones:

The Thruſh, his, whiſtles to his Hen;

The Sparrow chirps out his agen;

Snakes breath their amorous ſighs in Hiſſes,

This Dialect no Creature miſſes.

The Virgin Lilly, baſhfull Roſe,

In Odours their ſoft ſighs diſcloſe;

Theirs, ſportive VVinds in whiſpers! re [...]th;

Earth hers in Vapours doth bequeath

To her caeleſtiall Lover; He,

Touch't with an equall Sympathie,

To fann the Flame with which ſhe burns,

In gentle Gales his ſighs returns.

[[Page 98]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=56) Yee
glowing Sparks of a chaſt Fire!

Now to thoſe radiant Lights aſpire,

The fairer Neſts of my fair Love,

And the bright Spheres where you ſhould move.

### 2.5. The Surpriſe.

THere's no dallying with Love

Though he be a Child and blind;

Then let none the danger prove

VVho would to himſelf be kind:

Smile he does when thou do'ſt play,

But his ſmiles to death betray.

Lately with the Boy I ſported;

Love I did not, yet Love feign'd;

Had not Miſtreſs, yet I courted;

Sigh I did, yet was not pain'd;

Till at laſt this Love in Jeaſt,

'Prov'd in Earneſt my Un [...]eſt.

VVhen I ſaw my fair One firſt,

In a feigned fire I burn'd;

But true flames my poor Heart pierc't,

VVhen her Eyes on mine ſhe turn'd:

So a reall VVound I took

For my counterfeited Look.

Slighted Love his skill to ſhow,

Strook me with a Mortall Dart;

Then I learnt that 'gainſt his Bow,

Vain are the weak Helps of Art:

And thus captiv'd, found that true

Doth diſſembled Love purſue.

[[Page 99]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=56)

'Cauſe his Fetters I diſclam'd,

Now the Tyrant faſter bound Me;

VVith more ſcorching Brands inflam'd,

'Cauſe in Love ſo cold he found me:

And my ſighs more ſcalding made,

'Cauſe with VVinds before they playd.

None who loves not then make ſhew,

Love's as ill deceiv'd as Fate;

Fly the Boy, hee'l cogg and wooe;

Mock him, and he wounds thee ſtrait.

Ah! who dally boaſt in vain;

Falſe Love wants not reall Pain.

### 2.6. Chloris Eyes and Breaſts.

Chloris! on thine Eyes I gaz'd;

When amaz'd

At their brightnes,

On thy Breaſts I caſt my Look;

No leſſe took

With their whitenes:

Both I juſtly did admire,

Theſe all Snow, and thoſe all Fire.

Whilſt theſe Wonders I ſurvay'd,

Thus I ſaid

In ſuſpence;

Nature could have done no leſſe

To expreſſe

Her Providence,

Than that two ſuch fair Worlds, might

Have two Suns to give them Light.

[[Page 100]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=57)

### 2.7. Love's Arithmetick.

BY a gentle River laid,

Thirſis to his Phillis ſaid;

Equall to theſe ſandy Grains,

Is the Number of my Pains:

And the Drops within their Bounds

Speak the ſum of all my Wounds.

Phillis, whom like Paſſion burns,

Thirſis Anſwer thus returns:

Many as the Earth hath leaves,

Are the Griefs my heart receives;

And the Stars, which Heaven inſpires,

Reckon my conſuming Fires.

Then the Shepheard, in the Pride

Of his happy Love, reply'd:

With the Choriſters of Air

Shall our numerous Joyes compare;

And our mutuall Pleaſures vy

With the Cupids in thine Eye.

Thus the willing Shepheardeſſe

Did her ready Love expreſſe:

In Delights our Pains ſhall ceaſe,

And our War be cur'd by Peace;

We will count our Griefs with Bliſſes,

Thouſand Torments, Thouſand Kiſſes.

[[Page 101]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=57)

### 2.8. Caelia weeping. A Dialogue.

Lover.

SAy gentle God of Love, in Caelia's Breſt,

Can Joy and Grief together reſt?

Love.

No; for thoſe differing Paſſions are,

Nor in one Heart at once can ſhare.

Lover.

Why grieves hers then at once, and joyes,

Whilſt it anothers Heart deſtroyes?

Love.

Miſtaken Man! that Grief ſhe ſhowes,

Is but what martyr'd Hearts diſcloſe

Which in her Breaſt tormented lye,

And Life can neither hope, nor dy.

Lover.

And yet a ſhowre of Pearly Rain

Does her ſoft Cheeks fair Roſes ſtain.

Love.

Alas! thoſe Tears you hers ſurmiſe,

Are the ſad Tribute of poor Lovers Eyes.

Chorus.

Lover & Love.

What reall then in VVomen can be known!

When nor their Joys, nor Sorrows are their own?

[[Page 102]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=58)

### 2.9. The Vow.

BY my Life I vow,

That my Life, art Thou;

By my Heart, and by my Eyes:

But thy Faith denies

To my juſter Oath t' encline,

For thou ſay'ſt I ſwear by thine.

By this Sigh I ſwear,

By this falling Tear,

By the undeſerved Pains

My griev'd Soul ſuſtains.

Now thou may'ſt beleeve my Moan,

Theſe are too too much my own.

### 2.10. Ice & Fire.

NAked Love, did to thine Eye,

Chloris, once to warm him, fly;

But it's ſubtle Flame, and Light,

Scorch'd his Wings, and ſpoyl'd his ſight.

Forc'd from thence he went to reſt

In the ſoft Couch of thy Breſt:

But there met a Froſt ſo great,

As his Torch extinguiſh'd ſtrait.

When poor Cupid, thus, (conſtrain'd

His cold Bed to leave) complain'd;

'Laſs! what lodging's here for Me,

If all Ice and Fire She be.

[[Page 103]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=58)

### 2.11. Novo Inamoramento.

ANd yet anew entangled, ſee

Him, who eſcap'd the ſnare ſo late!

A Truce, no League thou mad'ſt with Me

Falſe Love! which now is out of date:

Fool, to beleeve the Fire quite out, alas!

VVhich only laid aſleep in Embers was.

The Sickneſs not at firſt paſt cure,

By this Relapſe deſpiſeth Art:

Now, treacherous Boy, thou haſt me ſure,

Playing the VVanton with my Heart,

As fooliſh Children that a Bird have got,

Slacken the Thread, but not unty the knot.

### 2.12. Caelia's Eyes. A Dialogue.

Lover.

LOve! tell me; may we Caelia's Eyes eſteem

Or Eyes, or Stars? for Stars they ſeem.

Love.

Fond, ſtupid Man! know Stars they are,

Nor can Heaven boaſt more bright or fair.

Lover.

Are they or erring Lights, or fixed? ſay.

Love.

Fix'd; yet lead many a Heart a ſtray.

[[Page 104]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=59)

### 2.13. The Reſemblance.

MArble (coy Caelia!) 'gainſt my Pray'rs thou art,

And at thy Frown to Marble I convert.

Love thought it fit, and Nature, thus

To manifeſt their ſeverall Powers in us.

Love made me Marble, Nature thee;

To expreſs Conſtancy and Cruelty.

Now both of us ſhall Monuments remain;

I of firm Faith, thou of Diſdain.

### 2.14. Love once, Love ever.

SHall I hopeleſs then purſue

A fair ſhadow that ſtill flies me?

Shall I ſtill adore, and wooe

A proud Heart that does deſpiſe me?

I a conſtant Love may ſo,

But alas! a fruitleſs ſhew.

Shall I by the erring Light

Of two croſſer Stars ſtill ſail?

That do ſhine, but ſhine in ſpight,

Not to guide, but make me fail?

I a wandring Courſe may ſteer,

But the Harbour ne'r come near.

Whilſt theſe Thoughts my Soul poſſeſs,

Reaſon, Paſſion would o'rſway;

Bidding me my Flames ſuppreſs,

Or divert ſome other way:

But what Reaſon would purſue,

That my Heart runs counter to.

[[Page 105]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=59)

So a Pilot bent to make

Search for ſome unfound out Land,

Does with him the Magnet take,

Sailing to the unknown Strand;

But that (ſteer which way he will)

To the loved North points ſtill.

### 2.15. The Pendants.

THoſe Aſpes of Gold with Gems that ſhine,

And in Enammel'd Curles do twine,

Why Chloris in each Ear

Doſt thou for Pendants wear?

—I now the hidden meaning gueſs:

Thoſe Myſtick ſigns expreſs

The ſtings thine Eyes do dart

Killing as Snakes into my Heart:

And ſhew that to my Prayers

Thine Ears are deaf as theirs.

### 2.16. The ſweet Meat.

Thou gav'ſt me late to eat

A ſweet without, but within, bitter Meat:

As if thou would'ſt have ſaid, Here, taſte in this

What Caelia is.

But if there ought to be

A likeneſs (deereſt!) 'twixt thy gift and thee,

VVhy firſt what's ſweet in thee ſhould I not taſte,

The bitter laſt?

[[Page 106]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=60)

### 2.17. Violets in Thaumantia's Boſome.

TVVice happy Violets! that firſt had Birth

In the warm Spring, when no froſts nip the Earth;

Thrice happy now; ſince you tranſplanted are

Unto the ſweeter Boſome of my Fair.

And yet poor Flowers! I pitty your hard Fate,

You have but chang'd, not better'd your Eſtate:

What boots it you t' have ſcap'd cold Winters breath,

To find, like me, by Flames a ſudden death?

### 2.18. The Dream.

FAir ſhadow! faithleſs as my Sun!

Of peace ſhe robs my Mind,

And to my Senſe, which reſt doth ſhun,

Thou art no leſs unkind.

She my Addreſs diſdainfull  [...]lies,

And thou like her art fleet;

The reall Beauty ſhe denies,

And tho [...] the Counterfeit.

To croſs my innocent deſires,

And make my Griefs extreme,

A Cruell Miſtris thus conſpires

With a deluſive Dream.

[[Page 107]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=60)

### 2.19. An old Shepheard to a young Nymph.

SCorn me not Fair becauſe you ſee

My Hairs are white; what if they be?

Think not 'cauſe in your Cheeks appear

Freſh ſprings of Roſes all the year,

And mine, like Winter, wan and old,

My Love like Winter ſhould be cold:

See in the Garland which you wear

How the ſweet bluſhing Roſes there

With pale-hu'd Lillies do combine?

Be taught by them; ſo let us joyn.

### 2.20. Beauty encreaſed by Pity.

'TIs true; thy Beauty, (which before

Did dazle each bold gazers Eye,

And forc'd even Rebell-Hearts t' adore,

Or from its conquering ſplendour fly)

Now ſhines with new encreaſe of Light,

Like Cynthia at her full, more bright.

Yet though thou glory in th' Increaſe

Of ſo much Beauty deereſt Fair!

They err who think this great Acceſs,

(Of which all Eyes th' Admirers are)

Or Art, or Nature's gift ſhould be:

Learn then the hidden Cauſe from Me.

[[Page 108]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=61) Pitty in
thee, in me deſire

Firſt bred; (before, I durſt but aime

At fair Reſpect) now that cloſe fire

Thy Love hath fann'd into a flame:

Which mounting to its proper Place,

Shines like a Glory 'bout thy Face.

### 2.21. Weeping and Kiſſing.

A Kiſs I begg'd; but ſmiling, Shee

Deny'd it Me:

When ſtrait, her Cheeks with tears o'rflown,

(Now kinder grown)

What ſmiling ſhee'd not let me have.

She weeping gave.

Then you whom ſcornfull Beauties aw,

Hope yet Relief,

For Love, (who Tears from Smiles) can draw

Pleaſure from Grief.

### 2.22. The Dilemma.

AS poor Strephon (whom hard Fate

Slave to Chloris Eyes decreed)

By his cruell fair one ſate,

Whilſt his fat Flocks graz'd along:

To the Muſick of his Reed,

This was the ſad Shepheards Song.

[[Page 109]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=61) From
thoſe tempting Lips if I

May not ſteal a Kiſs (my Dear!)

I ſhall longing pine and dye:

And a Kiſs if I obtain,

My Heartfears (thine Eyes ſo near)

By their lightning 'twill be ſlain.

Thus I know not what to try:

This I know yet, that I dye.

### 2.23. Change defended.

LEave Chloris, leave, prethee no more

With want of Love, or Lightneſs charge Me:

'Cauſe thy Looks captiv'd me before,

May not anothers now enlarge me?

He, whoſe miſguided Zeal hath long

Pay'd Homage to ſome Stars pale light,

Better enform'd, may without wrong

Leave that, t'adore the Queen of Night.

Then if my Heart, which long ſerv'd thee,

Will to Car [...]ntha now encline;

Why term'd inconſtant ſhould it be,

For bowing 'fore a richer ſhrine?

Cenſure that Lover's ſuch, whoſe will

Inferiour Objects can entice;

VVho changes for the better ſtill,

Makes that a Vertue, you call Vice.

[[Page 110]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=62)

### 2.24. The Microcoſme.

MAn of himſelf's a little VVorld, but join'd

VVith VVoman, VVoman for that end deſign'd,

(Hear cruell fair One whilſt I this rehearſe!)

He makes up then a compleat Univerſe.

Man like this ſublunary VVorld is, born

The ſport of two croſs Planets, Love, and Scorn:

VVoman the other VVorld reſembles well,

In whoſe Looks Heav'n is, in whoſe Breaſt is Hell.

### 2.25. The Defeat.

GAinſt Celinda's Marble Breſt

All his Arrows having ſpent,

And in vain each Arrow ſent,

Impotent, unarmed Love,

In a ſhady Myrtle Grove

Layd him down to reſt.

'Soon as layd, aſleep he fell:

And a Snake, in (as he ſlept)

To his empty Quiver crept.

VVhen fair Chloris, whoſe ſoft Heart

Love had wounded, (and its ſmart

Lovers beſt can tell)

This Advantage having ſpy'd;

Of his Quiver, and his Bow

Thought to rob her ſleeping Foe:

Softly going then about

To have ſeiz'd upon them; out

Strait the Snake did glide.

[[Page 111]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=62)

With whoſe Hiſſes frighted, ſhe,

(Nimbly ſtarting back again)

Thus did to her ſelf complain:

Never cruell Archer! never

(Full, or empty) does thy Quiver

Want a ſting for Me.

### 2.26. Amore ſecreto.

Content thy ſelf fond Heart! nor more

Let thy cloſe Flames be ſeen:

If thou with covert Zeal adore

Thy Saint enſhrin'd within,

Thou haſt thy Feaſt, as well as they

That unto Love keep open Holy-day.

In his Religion, all are free

To ſerve him as they may.

In publick ſome, and ſome there be

Their vows in private pay.

Love that does to all Humours bend,

Admits of ſeverall Waies unto one End.

Yet wilt thou not repining ceaſe!

Still doſt thou murmurs vent?

[...]tubborn, Rebellious Zealot, peace!

Nor ſign of Diſcontent

So much as in one ſigh afford;

For to the Wife in Love, each ſigh [...]s a Word.

[[Page 112]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=63)

### 2.27. A Maid in Love with a Youth blind of one Eye.

THough a Sable Cloud benight

One of thy fair Twins of Light,

Yet the other brighter ſeems,

As 't had robb'd its Brother's Beams;

Or both Lights to one were run,

Of two Stars, now made one Sun.

Cunning Archer! who knows yet

But thou wink'ſt my Heart to hit!

Cloze the other too, and All

Thee the God of Love will call.

### 2.28. The broken Faith.

LAtely by cleer Thames his ſide,

Fair Lycoris I eſpy'd

With the Pen of her white hand

Theſe words printing on the Sand:

None Lycoris doth approve

But Mirtillo for her Love.

Ah falſe Nymph! thoſe Words were fit

In Sand only to be writ:

For the quickly riſing Streams

Of Oblivion, and the Thames,

In a little Moments ſtay

From the Shore waſh'd clean away

What thy hand had there impreſt,

And Mirtillo from thy Breſt.

[[Page 113]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=63)

### 2.29. Complaint on the Death of Sylvia, to the River.

CLeer Brook! which by thy ſelf art chac'd,

And from thy ſelf doſt fly as faſt,

Stay here a little; and in Brief

Hear the ſad Story of my Grief:

Then, haſting to the Sea, declare

Her Waves not half ſo bitter are.

Tell her how Sylvia (ſhe who late

Was the ſole Regent of my Fate)

Hath yeelded up her ſweeteſt Breath,

In the beſt Time of Life, to Death:

Who proud of ſuch a Victory,

At once triumphs o'r Love, and Me.

But more (Alas!) I cannot ſpeak;

Sighs ſo my ſadder Accents break.

Farewell kind Floud! now take thy Way,

And like my Thoughts, ſtill reſtleſs, ſtray:

If we retarded have thy Courſe,

Hold! with theſe Tears thy ſpeed inforce.

[[Page 114]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=64)

### 2.30. A Shepheard inviting a Nymph to his Cottage.

DEer! on yond' Mountain ſtands my humble Cot,

'Gainſt Sun and Wind by ſpreading Oaks ſecur'd;

And with a Fence of Quickſet round immur'd,

That of a Cabban, make 't a ſhady Grot.

My Garden's there: o'r which, the Spring hath ſpread

A flowry Robe; where thou may'ſt gather Poſies

Of Gilliflowers, Pinks, Jelſomines, and Roſes,

Sweets for thy Boſome, Garlands for thy Head.

Down from that Rocks ſide runs a purling Brook

In whoſe unſullied Face,

(Though thine needs no new Grace,)

Thou mayſt, as thou think'ſt beſt, compoſe thy Look,

And there thine own fair Object made,

Try which (judg'd by the River) may by ſaid

The greater Fire.

That which my Breſt feels, or thy Eyes inſpire.

### 2.31. To Ligurinus. Horat. Carm. l. 4. Od. 10. Paraphraſticè.

CRuel, and fair! when this ſoft down,

(Thy Youths bloom,) ſhall to briſtles grow;

And theſe fair Curls thy ſhoulders crown,

Shall ſhed, or cover'd be with ſnow:

[[Page 115]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=64)

When thoſe bright Roſes that adorn

Thy Cheeks ſhall wither quite away,

And in thy Glaſs (now made Time's ſcorn)

Thou ſhalt thy changed Face ſurvey.

Then, ah then (ſighing) thou't deplore

Thy Ill-ſpent Youth; and wiſh, in vain,

Why had I not thoſe thoughts before?

Or come not my firſt Looks again?

### 2.32. The Penitent Murderer. Theocrit. Idyl. 31.  [...].

VVHen Venus ſaw Adonis dead,

His Treſſes ſoyl'd, his Colour fled,

She ſtrait her winged Loves commands

To bring the cruell Boar in Bands.

They, the Woods nimbly ranging, found

The penſive Beaſt, and brought him bound:

This drags along the captiv'd foe,

That pricks him forward with his Bow.

With trembling ſteps the Boar drew nigh,

For he fear'd angry Venus Eye.

—T' whom thus ſhe ſpake: O thou the Worſt,

Of all wild Beaſts, and moſt accurſt!

Was't thou with wounding Turks didſt tear

This whiter Thygh? thou kill my Dear?

To whom the Boar reply'd, I ſwear

By thy ſelf Venus, by thy Dear,

By theſe my Bonds, theſe Hunters, I

Meant to thy Love no Injury:

[[Page 116]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=65) But
gazing on him, as ſome fair

Statue, unapt the flames to bear

Deſire had kindled in my Breſt,

To kiſs his naked Thigh I preſt;

And kiſſing, kill'd him: wherefore theſe,

Theſe murd'ring Tusks, doom as you pleaſe.

(For why alas! Teeth do I bear

That uſeleſs and enamour'd are?)

Or if a puniſhment too ſmall

You yet think that, take Lips and All.

But Venus, pittying the Beaſt,

Commands that ſtrait he be releas'd;

Who to the Woods ne'r went again,

But liv'd as one of Venus Train:

And coming one Day near a Fire,

Quench'd there the flames of his Deſire.

### 2.33. The Shepheard. Theocrit. Idyl. 21.

FAir Eunica I ſweetly would have kiſt,

But was with ſcorn, and this reproach diſmiſt.

Hence! what? a Shepheard, and yet hope from Me

For ſuch a Grace? We kiſs no Clowns, ſaith ſhe.

My Lips I would not with a kiſs ſo vile

As thine, ſo much as in a Dream defile.

Lord! how thou look'ſt? how like a Lubber ſport'ſt?

What fine diſcourſe thou haſt? how ſweetly court'ſt?

How ſoft thy Beard is? and how neat thy Hair?

Thy Lips like ſick mens bluſh, and thy hands are

White as an Ethiops: fogh! thou ſtink'ſt, out, quick,

Carrion! be gone; leſt thy ſmell make me ſick.

Then in her Breſt thrice ſpitting, me a skew

(Mumbling t'her ſelf) from Head to foot doth view.

[[Page 117]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=65) Such
Pride in her ſelf-flatter'd Beauty takes,

Whilſt in Deriſion Mouths at Me ſhe makes.

This ſcorn my bloud inflam'd, and red I grew

With anger, like a Roſe new bath'd in Dew.

She went her way, and left me vext, to ſee

I ſhould by ſuch a Huſwife ſlighted be.

Say Shepheards! am I not a handſome Lad?

Or hath ſome God transform'd, and lately made

M'another Man? for once I'd a good face:

And that (as Ivy Trees) my Beard did grace;

My Locks like Smallage 'bout my Temples twin'd;

And my white Front 'bove my black Eye-brows ſhin'd.

My Eyes more lovely than Minerva's were,

Than Curds my Lips more ſoft, and ſweeter far

My Words than Honey: play too, would you knew't,

I ſweetly can; on Pipe, Shalm, Reed, and Flute.

There's not a Country Laſs but likes, as paſſes,

And loves me too: all but your City Laſſes;

Who, 'cauſe a Shepheard, me without regard

(Forſooth!) paſs by, alas! they never heard

How Bacchus on the Plains did Oxen tend,

And Venus to a Shepheards Love did bend,

And his fat Flocks on Phrygian Mountains kept,

Or lov'd in Woods, and for Adonis wept.

VVhat was Endymion but a Shepheard? whom

The Moon affected, and from Heaven would come

To lye whole Nights on Latmus with the Boy.

A Shepheard (Rhea) too was once thy Joy:

And oh, how many ſcapes Jove didſt thou make

From Juno's Bed for a young Shepheard's ſake?

But Eunica alone doth Swains deſpiſe,

And 'bove thoſe Goddeſſes her ſelf doth prize.

Venus no more thou with thy Love may'ſt keep

In Town, or Hill; alone thou now muſt ſleep,

[[Page 118]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=66)

### 2.34. The Paſtorall Wooing. Daphnis, and Shepheardeſs. Theocrit. Idyl. 28.

Daphnis.

PAris the Swain, away coy Helen bare:

And I, a Swain, am kiſs'd by one more fair.

Shepheardeſs.

Brag not rude Hind; Kiſſes are empty things.

Daphnis.

From empty Kiſſes yet ſweet pleaſure ſprings.

Shepheardeſs.

I'l waſh my mouth, wipe off thy Kiſſes ſtain.

Daphnis.

Wip'ſt thou thy Lips? then let us kiſs again.

Shepheardeſs.

Go kiſs your Cows; you fit to kiſs a Maid!

Daphnis.

Be not ſo proud: your youth will quickly fade.

Shepheardeſs.

Grapes though they're dry, yet ſtill are Grapes we ſee,

And Roſes although wither'd, Roſes be.

Daphnis.

Let's ſit and talk beneath this Myrtles ſhade.

Shepheardeſs.

No; your ſmooth Tongue me once before betraid.

Daphnis.

Beneath theſe Elms then ſit and hear me play.

Shepheardeſs.

Play to your ſelf; I not your Muſick weigh.

Daphnis.

[[Page 119]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=66)

Take heed leſt thou the Wrath of Venus find!

Shepheardeſs.

Venus her worſt; be but Diana kind.

Daphnis.

Oh ſay not ſo: leſt her excited Rage

Thee in unextricable Snares ingage.

Shepheardeſs.

Do what ſhe can, find we Diana's Grace.

Hold off your hands, or elſe I'l ſcratch your Face.

Daphnis.

Love, which no Maid e'r did, thou muſt not fly.

Shepheardeſs.

By Pa [...] I will: why doſt thou preſs ſo nigh?

Daphnis.

I fear he'l make thee ſtoop to thy firſt Love.

Shepheardeſs.

Though woo'd by many, none I did approve.

Daphnis.

Amongſt thoſe many, here, behold! I ſue.

Shepheardeſs.

Why, my kind Friend, what would'ſt thou have me do?

The married Life with troubles is repleat.

Daphnis.

No Cares, Joys only Marriage doth beget.

Shepheardeſs.

They ſay, Wives of their Husbands live in fear.

Daphnis.

Of whom do Women? rather domineer.

Shepheardeſs.

But thought of Child-bed Pains makes me afraid.

Daphnis.

Diana, whom thou ſerv'ſt, will be thy Aid.

Shepheardeſs.

[[Page 120]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=67)

But bearing Children will my Beauty wrong.

Daphnis.

In Children thou wilt ſee thy ſelf ſtill young.

Shepheardeſs.

What Dowry wilt thou give if I conſent?

Daphnis.

My Flocks, my Groves, my Fields, be thou content.

Shepheardeſs.

Swear, that, when married, thou wilt ne'r forſake me.

Daphnis.

By Pan I will not, ſo thou pleaſe to take me.

Shepheardeſs.

Thou'lt give me Beds, and Houſe, and Sheep to breed?

Daphnis.

Both Houſe, and Beds, and the fair Flocks I feed.

Shepheardeſs.

What ſhall I to my aged Father ſay?

Daphnis.

He, when he hears my Name, will ſoon give way.

Shepheardeſs.

How art thou call'd? for Names do often pleaſe.

Daphnis.

Daphnis my Name, my Father's Lycides,

My Mother's Nomaea.

Shepheardeſs.

Of an honeſt Line

Thou com'ſt, nor we of no more mean than thine.

Daphnis.

Yet not ſo great to make your Pride aſpire,

For, as I tak't, Menalcas is your Sire.

Shepheardeſs,

Shew me your Stalls, and Groves.

Daphnis.

[[Page 121]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=67)

Come let thine Eyes

VVitneſs how high my Cypreſs Trees do riſe.

Shepheardeſs.

Feed Goats whilſt I ſurvay the Shepheard's Bounds.

Daphnis.

Graze Bullocks whilſt I ſhew the Nymph my Grounds.

Shepheardeſs.

VVhat do'ſt? why thruſt'ſt thy hand into my Breſt?

Daphnis.

Thus thy ſoft, ſwelling Boſome ſhould be preſt.

Shepheardeſs.

Help Pan! I faint; Swain, take thy hand away.

Daphnis.

Fear not ſweet Nymph; nor tremble with diſmay.

Shepheardeſs.

'Twill ſpoyle my Coat ſhould I i'th' durt be thrown.

Daphnis.

No; ſee! on this ſoft hide I'l lay thee down.

Shepheardeſs.

Ah Me! why haſt thou loos [...]d my Virgin Zone?

Daphnis.

To Venus this be an Oblation.

Shepheardeſs.

Heark! ſee! ſome body comes; I hear a Noiſe.

Daphnis.

The Cypreſs Trees are whiſpering of our Joyes.

Shepheardeſs.

Th'haſt torn my Cloaths, and me quite naked layd.

Daphnis.

I'l give thee better.

Shepheardeſs.

VVords no deeds e'r paid.

Daphnis.

[[Page 122]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=68)

Would I could ſend my ſoul into thee now!

Shepheardeſs.

Oh Phoebe, pardon! I have broke my Vow.

Daphnis.

A Calf to Love, a Bull to Venus burn.

Shepheardeſs.

A Maid I came, a Woman ſhall return.

Daphnis.

And be a Mother-Nurſe to pretty Boyes.

Shepheardeſs.

Thus intertalk'd they mid'ſt the active Joyes

Of cloſs Embraces; when at length they roſe,

And being up, to feed her Flock ſhe goes

With bluſhing Face, but with a lightſome Heart,

Whilſt to his Heards he no leſs pleas'd doth part.

### 2.35. On the Picture of Icarus in Wax. Marino.

VVHat once did unto thee impart

The means of Death; by happy Art

Now thee reſtores to life again:

Yet ſtill remember to refrain

Ambitious Flights; nor ſoar too nigh

The Sun of an inflaming Eye;

For ſo thou may'ſt, ſcorcht by thoſe Beams,

In Aſhes dye, as once in Streams.

[[Page 123]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=68)

### 2.36. On a Marble Statue of Nero, which falling kill'd a Child. Marino.

THis Statue, bloudy Nero does preſent;

To Tyrants a ſad Document.

Though Marble, on his Baſis yet ſo faſt

He ſtood not, but he fell at laſt.

And ſeems as when he liv'd, as cruell ſtill,

He could not fall, but he muſt kill.

### 2.37. On Paula. Mart. l. 9. Epig. 5.

FAin ſhee'd have Priſcus; and who blame her can?

But hee'l not have her: and who'l blame the Man?

### 2.38. On an Ill Husband and Wife. Mart. l. 8. Epigr. 34.

SInce both of you ſo like in Manners be,

Thou the worſt Husband, and the worſt Wife ſhe,

I wonder, you no better ſhould agree.

### 2.39. On Candidus, a rich Miſer. Mart. l. 3. Epig. 26.

Alone thou doſt enjoy a fair Eſtate,

Alone rare Myrrhme Veſſels, golded Plate;

Alone rich Wines doſt drink; and haſt for None

A Heart, nor Wit but for thy ſelf alone.

None ſhares with thee, it is deny'd by no man:

But Candidus, thou haſt a Wife that's Common.

### 2.40. On Baſſus a Pittifull Poet. Mart. l. 5. Epigr. 53.

VVHy writ'ſt thou of Thyeſtes, Colchis hate,

Andromache, or Niobes ſad Fate?

Deucalion (Baſſus!) better far would fit,

Or Phaeton, believe me, with thy Wit.

### 2.41. On a Boy kill [...]d by the fall of an Iceſicle. Mart. l. 4. Epig.
18.

VVHer ſtreams from Vipſan Pipes Port Capen pow'rs,

And the Stones moyſtned are with conſtant ſhow'rs,

A drop congeal'd to a ſharp Iceſicle

On a Child's Throat that ſtood beneath it, fell,

[[Page 125]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=69) And when
the Wretches Fate diſſolv'd it had,

Melted away in the warm VVound it made.

VVhat may not cruell Fate? or where will not

Death find us out, if VVater Throats can cut?

### 2.42. On Neſtor a whiſperer. Mart. l. 3. Epig. 28.

THou wonder'ſt Marius Ears ſhould ſmell ſo Ill:

They may thank thee; thou whiſper'ſt in 'em ſtill.

### 2.43. On Martinia, an old, old, leacherous— Mart. l. 3. Epigr. 32.

VVHat? canſt thou not with an old VVoman bed

Thou crieſt?—yes: but thou art not old but dead.

VVe could with Hecuba, or Niobe

Make ſhift, but then (Martinia!) it muſt be

Before the one

Into a Bitch be turn'd, t'other to Stone.

### 2.44. On Philomuſe, a needy Newes­monger. Mart. l. 9. Epig. 35.

TO gain a Supper, thy ſhift (Philomuſe!)

Is to vent lies, inſtead of Truths, for News:

[[Page 126]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=70) Thou
knowſt what Pacor [...]s intends to do,

Can'ſt count the German Troops and Sarmats too.

The Dacian General's Mandates doſt profeſs

To know, and Victories before the Expreſs.

How oft it rains in Aegypt, thou as well,

And Number of the Lybian Fleet, canſt tell.

VVhom Victor in the next Quinquatrian Games

Caeſar will crown, thy knowing Tongue proclames:

Come, leave theſe ſhifts: thou this Night (Philomuſe)

Shalt ſup with Me; but, not a word of News.

### 2.45. On Aulus a Poet-Hater. Mart. l. 8. Epig. 63.

AUlus Loves Theſtius, him Alexis fires;

Perhaps he too, our Hyaci [...]h deſires;

Go now, and doubt if Poets he approves,

When the Delights of Poets Aulus Loves!

### 2.46. On Lentinus, being troubled with an Ague. Mart. l. 12. Epig. 17.

LEntinus! thou doſt nought but fume, and fret,

To think thy Ague will not leave thee yet.

Why? it goes with thee; bathes as thou doſt do,

Eats Muſhromes, Oyſters, Sweet-breads, wild Boar too,

Oft drunk by thee with Falern Wine is made,

Nor Caecub drinks unleſs with ſnow allay'd:

[[Page 127]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=70) Tumbles
in Roſes dawb'd with unctuous ſweets,

Sleeps upon Down between pure Cambrick ſheets,

And when thus well it fares with thee, wouldſt thou

Have it to go unto poor Damma now?

### 2.47. To Priſcus. Mart. l. 8. Epigr. 11.

VVHy a rich Wife (Priſcus) I will not wed,

Ask'ſt thou?—I would not have my Wife, my Head:

Husbands ſhould have ſuperiority;

So Man and Wife can only equall be.

### 2.48. On Phoebus that wore leather Caps. Mart l. Epig.

VVHilſt thou a Kidskin Cap putt'ſt on

To hide the Baldneſs of thy Crown,

On jeſted wittily, who ſed,

Phoebus, that thou hadſt ſhod thy Head.

### 2.49. On Horace a poor fellow. Mart. l. 4. Epigr. 2.

HOrace alone, 'mongſt all the Company,

In a black Gown the Plays did lately ſee.

Whilſt both the Commons, and the Knights of Rome,

Senate, and Caeſar all in white did come.

Beheld as well as all the reſt, in white.

### 2.50. On a Swallow torn in Peeces by her Fellowes. Mart. l. 5. Epig. 67.

WHen for their winter Homes the Swallows made,

One 'gainſt the Cuſtome in her old Neſt ſtaid.

The reſt at Spring return'd, the Crime perceive,

And the offending Bird of Life bereave.

Late yet ſhe ſuffer'd, ſhe deſerv'd before,

But then when ſhe in Peeces Itys tore.

### 2.51. To Apollo purſuing Daphne. Auſon.

THrow by thy Bow, nor let thy Shafts appear,

She flies not thee, but does thy weapons fear,

### 2.52. De Erotio Puella. Mart. l. 5. Epigr. 38.

SHe, (who than down of aged Swans more fair,

More ſoft was than Galaeſian Lambkins are;

More beautious than thoſe Shels Lucrinus ſhews,

Paetus perſwades me not to grieve for her;

Fye, ſaies he, (whilſt his hair he ſeems to tear)

Art not aſham'd to mourn thus for a Slave?

THou mad'ſt thy Brags that late to thee a Friend

A hundred Crowns did for a Preſent ſend:

And yeſterday, when at the Play we were,

At comming forth, thou told'ſt me in my Ear,

There fell to thee that Morning, the beſt part

Of Fourſcore Pounds per Annum next thy Heart.

What wrong have I thy poor Friend done thee, that

Thou thus ſhouldſt torture me? Leave, leave this Chat

For pitties ſake; or if thou'lt not forbear,

Tell me then ſomething that I'd gladly hear.

### 2.54. On Picens. Mart. l. 8. Epig. 62.

PIcens the Backſide of his Book doth fill

With tedious Epigrams; yet takes it ill

Phoebus ſhould ſhew himſelf his Back Friend ſtill.

### 2.55. On Caius, one of large Promiſes, but ſmall Performances. Mart. l.
10. Epig. 16.

IF not to give, but ſay ſo, giving be,

Caius! for giving we will vie with thee.

What e'r the Spaniard in Gallician Feilds

Digs up, what the gold Stream of Tagus yields,

What the tann'd Indian dives for in the deep,

Or in its Neſt th' Arabion Bird doth keep,

The wealth which Tyrian Caldrons boyl; receive

Bll this, and more; but ſo as thou doſt give.

[[Page 131]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=72)

### 2.56. To Poſthumus, an Ill Liver. Mart. l. 5. Epigr. 58.

STill, ſtill thou cry'ſt to morrow I'l live well:

But when will this to morrow come? canſt tell?

How far is't hence? or where is't to be found?

Or upon Parthian, or Armenian Ground?

Priams, or Noſtors years by this't has got;

I wonder for how much it might be bought?

Thou'lt live to morrow?—'tis too late to day:

Hee's wiſe who yeſterday, I liv'd, can ſay.

### 2.57. To Theleſinus. Mart. l. 3. Epigr. 40.

THou think'ſt th' haſt ſhewn thy ſelf a mighty friend,

'Cauſe at my Sute thou fifty Pounds didſt lend:

But if thou, rich, for lending, may'ſt be ſaid

So great a Friend: what I, who Poor, repaid?

### 2.58. On Cinna a bold Suter. Mart. l. 3. Epigr. 60.

THou ſay'ſt 'tis nothing that thou ask'ſt me; Why,

If thou ask'ſt nothing, nothing I deny,

### 2.59. The happy life. To Julius Martialis. Mart. l. 10. Epig. 47.

THoſe things which make life truly bleſt,

Sweeteſt Martial hear expreſt:

Wealth left, and not from Labour growing;

A gratefull ſoyl, a Hearth ſtill glowing;

No Strife, ſmall Buſineſs, Peace of Mind,

Quick Wit, a Body well inclin'd,

Wiſe Innocence, Friends of one Heart,

Cheap Food, a Table without Art;

Nights which nor Cares, nor Surfets know,

No dull, yet a chaſte Bedfellow;

Sleeps which the tedious Hours contract;

Be what thou mayſt be, nor exact

Ought more; nor thy laſt Hour of breath

Fear, nor with wiſhes haſten Death.

### 2.60. Epitaphium Glaucae. Mart. l. 6. Epig. 28.

HEre Meliors Freed-man, known ſo well,

Who by all Rome lamented, fell,

His deareſt Patrons ſhort-liv'd Joy,

Glaucias, beneath this Stone doth lye,

Neer the Flaminian Way interr'd:

Chaſt, modeſt, whom quick Wit preferr'd

And happy Forme, who to twelve paſt,

Scarce one year added; that, his Laſt.

[[Page 133]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=73) If
Paſſenger thou weep'ſt for ſuch a Loſs,

Mayſt thou ne'r mourn for any other Croſs.

### 2.61. To Sextus. Mart. l. 2. Epig. 3.

YOu ſay y'ow nothing; and 'tis true you ſay;

For he ows only, who hath means to pay.

### 2.62. To Maximus. Mart. l. 7. Epig. 72.

TH' Eſquiliae a Houſe of thine doth ſhow

Mount Aventine, and the Patrician Row.

Hence Cybells Fane, thence Veſta's thou doſt view;

From this th' Old Jupiter, from that the New;

Where ſhall I meet thee? in what Quarter, tell?

He that does every where, does no where dwell.

### 2.63. To Stella. Mart. l. 7. Epigr. 35.

VVHen my poor Villa could not ſtorms ſuſtain,

Nor watry Jove, but ſwam in Flouds of Rain,

Thou ſent'ſt me Tyles, wherewith to make a Fence

'Gainſt the rude Tempeſts ſudden violence.

We thank thee Stella: but cold Winter's near,

The Villa's coverd, not the Villager.

[[Page 134]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=74)

### 2.64. On Parthenopaeus. Mart. l. 11. Epig. 87.

THy Doctor, that he may aſſwage the Pain

Of thy ſore Throat, which a ſharp Cough doth ſtrain,

Preſcribes thee Hony, ſweet-meats, luſcious Pies,

Or what e'r elſe ſtills fretfull Childrens cries:

Yet leav'ſt thou not thy coughing: now we ſee

'Tis no ſore Throat, but ſweet Tooth troubles thee.

### 2.65. On Philaenus. Mart. l. 11. Epigr. 102.

IF how Philaenus may be ſtil'd

A Father, who ne'r got a Child

Thou'd'ſt know; Davus can tell thee it,

Who is a Poet and ne'r writ

### 2.66. The Choice of his Miſtris. Mart. l. Epigr.

I would not have a VVench with ſuch a VVaſte

As might be well with a Thumb-Ring embrac'd;

VVhoſe bony Hips, which out on both ſides ſtick,

Might ſerve for Graters, and whoſe lean Knees prick;

One, which a ſaw does in her back-Bone bear,

And in her Rump below carries a Spear.

[[Page 135]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=74) Nor
would I have her yet of Bulk ſo groſſe

That weigh'd ſhould break the Scales at th' market-croſs;

A meer unfathom'd lump of Greaſe; no, that

Like they that will; 'tis Fleſh I love, not Fat.

### 2.67. To Sextus. Mart. l. 2. Epig. 55.

SExtus thou will'ſt that I ſhould ſhow

Thee Honour, where I love would ow;

And I obey ſince 'tis thy will,

By Me thou ſhalt be honour'd ſtill:

But Sextus if thou'lt honour'd be,

Thou ſhalt not then be lov'd by Me.

### 2.68. On Baucis, an old drunken Crone. Antholog. Graec.

BAucis the Bane of Pots, what time ſhe lay

Sick of a Feaver, thus to Jove did pray;

If I eſcape this Fit, I vow to take

Theſe hundred Suns no drink but from the Lake:

Wanting her wonted Cups, (now paſt all doubt

Of Danger) ſhe one day this ſhift found out,

She takes a Sive, and through the bottome pries;

So ſhe at once a hundred Suns eſpies.

[[Page 136]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=75)

### 2.69. On Captain Anſa, a bragging Run-away. Caſimire.

VVHilſt timorous Anſa lead his Martial Band

'Gainſt the Invaders of his Native Land,

Thus he beſpake his Men before the Fight:

Courage my Mates, let's dine, for we to Night

Shall Sup (ſaies he) in Heaven: this having ſaid,

'Soon as the threatning Enſigns were diſplaid,

And the loud Drums and Trumpets had proclam'd

Defiance 'twixt the Hoaſts; he, (who ne'r ſham'd

At Loſs of Honour) fairly ran away,

When being ask'd, how chance he would not ſtay

And go along with them to ſup in Heaven?

Pardon me Friends (ſaid he) I faſt this Even.

### 2.70. To Fuſcus. Mart. l. 1. Epig. 55.

IF Fuſcus thou haſt room for one Friend more,

(For well I know thou every where haſt ſtore)

Let me compleat the Liſt; nor be thought e'r

The worſe 'cauſe New; ſuch once thy old friends were:

But try if he you for your New Friend take,

May happily an old Companion make.

[[Page 137]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=75)

### 2.71. On Marcus Anton: Primus his Picture. Mart. l. 10. Epig. 32.

THis Picture, which with Violets you ſee

And Roſes deckt, askſt thou whoſe it may be?

Such was Antonius in his Prime of Years,

Who here ſtill young, though he grow old, appears.

Ah! could but Art have drawn his Mind in this,

Not all the World could ſhew a fairer Peece.

### 2.72. Horat.

SEeſt thou not, how Socrates Head,

(For all it's Height) ſtands covered

With a white Perriwigg of Snow?

Whilſt the labouring Woods below

Are hardly able to ſuſtain

The Weight of Winters feather'd Rain;

And the arreſted Rivers ſtand

Impriſon'd in an Icy Band?

Diſpell the Cold; and to the Fire

Add fuell, large as it's Deſire;

And from the Sabine Caſque let fly

(As free as Liberality)

The Grapes rich blood, kept ſince the Sun

His Annuall Courſe foure times hath run.

Leave to the Gods the reſt, who have

Allay'd the Winds, did fiercely rave

[[Page 138]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=76) In
Battail on the Billowy main,

Where they did bluſtring tug for Raign.

So that no ſlender Cypreſs now,

It's Spirelike Crown does tott'ring, bow:

Nor aged Aſhtrees, with the ſhock

Of Blaſts impetuous, doe rock.

Seek not too morrow's Fate to know;

But what day Fortune ſhall beſtow,

Put to a diſcreet Uſurie.

Nor (gentle youth!) ſo rigid be

With froward ſcorn to diſpprove

The ſweeter Blandiſhments of Love.

Nor mirthfull Revels ſhun, whilſt yet

Hoary Auſterity is ſet

Far from thy greener years; the Field

Or Cirque ſhould now thy Paſtime yield:

Now nightly at the Howre ſelect,

And pointed Place, Loves Dialect,

Soft whiſpers, ſhould repeated be;

And that kind Laughters Treacherie,

By which ſome Virgin cloſely layd

In dark Confinement, is betrayd:

And now from ſome ſoft Arm, or Wriſt,

A ſilken Braid, or ſilver Twiſt,

Or Ring from Finger, ſhould be gain'd,

By that too nicely not retain'd.

### 2.73. Ad Puellam edentulam. Mart. l. 2. Epig. 41.

SMile if th'art wiſe; ſmile ſtill, fair Maid!

Once the Pelignian Poet ſaid;

[[Page 139]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=76) But not
to all Maids ſpake he this,

Or ſpake he to all Maids I wiſſe,

Yet not to thee; for thou art None.

Thy bare Gums ſhow three Teeth alone,

Scal'd o'r with black and yellow Ruſt:

If then thy Glaſſe or Me thou'lt truſt,

Thou laughter ſhouldſt no leſſe abhorre,

Than rough Winds criſped Spanius, or

The neat-dreſt Priſcus the rude Touch

Of boiſterous hands, and feare as much

As Caelia does the Sun; or more

Than painted Baſſa does a ſhowre.

Looks thou ſhouldſt wear more grave, and ſad,

Than Hectors Wife, or Mother had:

Never at Comedies appear;

All feſtive Jollities forbear;

And what e'r elſe doth laughter cauſe,

And the clos'd Lips aſunder drawes.

Thou Childleſſe Mothers ſhouldſt alone,

Or Brothers hapleſſe Fates, bemoan:

Or follow ſtill ſome mournfull Hearſe,

And with ſad Tragedies converſe.

Then rather doe as I adviſe,

Weep (Galla) ſtill, weep, if th'art wiſe.

### 2.74. Epitaph on an old drunken Crone. Ex Antipatr. Sidon.

THis Tomb Maronis holds, o'r which, doth ſtand

A Bowle, carv'd out of Flint, by Mentor's hand:

The tipling Crone while living, death of friends

Ne'r toucht, nor Husbands, nor dear Childrens Ends.

[[Page 140]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=77) This
only troubles her, now dead; to think,

The Monumentall Bowle ſhould have no drink.

### 2.75. On Bibinus, a notorious Drunkard. Scaliger.

THe Sot Loſerus is drunk twice a day;

Bibinus only once; now of theſe, ſay,

Which may a man the greateſt Drunkard call?

Bibinus ſtill; for hee's drunk once for All.

### 2.76. On poor Codrus, who though blind, was yet in Love. Mart. l. 3. Epig.
15.

NOne in all Rome, like Codrus truſts I find;

How, and ſo poor! he loves, and yet is blind.

FINIS.

### 3.1. Auſonii Ludus ſeptum Sa­pientum.

#### 3.1.1. The Prologue.

THe ſeven Wiſemen, (that Name Times paſt apply'd

To them, nor hath Poſterity deny'd)

Themſelves this Day unto your view preſent.

Why doſt thou bluſh Gown'd Roman? diſcontent

That ſuch grave Men ſhould on the Stage be brought!

Is't ſhame to us! 'twas none to Athens thought:

Whoſe Councell-Chamber was their Theater.

True; here for Buſines ſev'rall Places are

Aſſign'd, the Cirque for Meetings, Courts to take

Enrollments, Forums in which Pleas to make:

But in old Athens, and all Greece, was known

No other Place for Buſines, but this

viz. the Theater.

One,

Which later Luxury in Rome did raiſe.

The Aedile heretofore did build for Playes

A Scaffold-ſtage, No work of Carved ſtone;

So Galbus and Murena did, 'tis known:

But after, when great Men not ſparing Coſt,

Thought it the higheſt Glory they could boaſt,

To build for Playes a Scene more eminent,

The Theater grew to this vaſt Extent;

[[Page 144]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=79) Which
Pompey, Balbus, Caeſar, did inlarge;

Vying, which ſhould exceed for State and Charge.

But to what End all this? We came not here

To tell you who firſt built the Theater

Or Forum, or who rais'd this Gallery;

But as the Prologue to a Comedy,

In which act Heaven-lov'd Sages; who in Verſe

Their own Judicious Sentences reherſe,

Known to the Learned, and perhaps to you:

But if your Mem'ries ſhall not well renue

Things ſpoke ſo long ſince; the Comedian ſhall,

Who better than I knows them, tell you all.

#### 3.1.2.

Enter Comedian.

A Thenian Solon, Fame ſings, wrote at Delphis

[...]; whoſe ſenſe, Know thy ſelf, is.

But this for Spartan Chilons many take.

Whether this Chilons be, ſome queſtion make,

[...]: Is't hard?

Wee'l engliſh't; Th' End of a long Life regard.

But this (ſay ſome) to Craeſus Solon ſung.

From Lesbian Pittacus this Motto ſprung,

[...]; that's Know-Time: But He

By  [...] here means Opportunitie.

[...], Bias, did proceed

From thee; that is, Moſt Men are Ill. Take heed

You not miſtake him; for by Ill Men here

He means the Ignorant: the next you hear

Is Periander's [...];

That is, Thought's All in All; a Thought-full Man!

But Lyndian Cleobulus does proteſt

[...]; Mean in All is beſt.

[[Page 145]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=79) Thales,
[...] cries.

Upon a Surety preſent Damage lies.

But this, 'fore thoſe who gain by it, to tell,

May 'chance diſpleaſe: Now Solon comes, farwell.

Exit.

#### 3.1.3.

Enter Solon.

LOe! on the Roman Stage is Solon come,

Clad in his Graecian Ornaments: To whom

Fame gave the Prize of Wiſdome from the reſt;

But Fame is not of Cenſure the ſtrict Teſt.

Nor firſt nor laſt I take my ſelf to be,

[...]or there's no Order in Equalitie.

Well did the Delphick Prophet ſport with him

Who ask'd, which firſt of the VViſe-men might ſeem,

[...]ying; if on a Globe their Names he writ,

[...]one firſt, or loweſt he ſhould find in it.

[...]om midd'ſt of that learn'd Round come I; that ſo,

[...]Vhat once I ſpake to Craeſus, All here now

[...]ight take as ſpoken to themſelves; 'Tis this:

[...]; which is

[...] Engliſh, Mark of a long life the End;

[...]ill then your Cenſure of All Men ſuſpend:

[...]or Miſerable Theſe, nor happy Thoſe

[...]ſteem; for None are ſuch till their laſt Cloſe.

[...]he Ground of this wee'l in few Words diſplay.

[...]Craeſus, the Tyrant King of Lydia,

[...]ppy, and rich even to Exceſſe! (who wall'd

[...]he Temples of his Gods with pure Gold) call'd

[...]e from my Country to him: We obey

[...]is Royall Summons, went to Lydia,

[...]illing his Subjects by our means might find

[...]heir King improv'd, and better'd in his Mind.

[[Page 146]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=80) He asks
Me whom I thought the happieſt Man?

I ſaid Telana the Athenian,

Who his life nobly for his Country gave;

He piſhes at it, will another have.

I told him then Aglaus who the Bounds

Ne'r paſt in all his life of his own grounds;

Smiling, he ſayes, what think you then of Me?

Eſteem'd the happyeſt in the whole World? We

Reply'd, his End could only make that known.

He takes this Ill: I, willing to be gon,

Kiſſe his hand, and ſo leave him: For ſome Ends

Meantime, 'gainſt Perſia he a War intends;

And all Things ready, does in Perſon goe.

How ſpeeds? hee's vanquiſh'd, Priſoner to his foe,

And ready now to yeeld his lateſt Breath,

(For by the Victor he was doom'd to death)

Upon the Funerall Pile rounded with Flames

And ſmoak, he thus with a loud voice exclames.

O Solon! Solon! now I plainly ſee

Th'art a true Prophet! thrice thus naming Me.

Mov'd with which words, Cyrus, (the Conquerour)

Commands the Fire be quencht; which, by a ſhowre

Of Rain then falling, happily was layd.

Thence to the King by a choice Guard convay'd,

And queſtion'd who that Solon was? and why

He call'd ſo on his Name? He, for Reply,

In Order all declares: Pitty at this

The Heart of Cyrus moves; and Craeſus is

Receiv'd to grace, who in a Princely Port

Liv'd after, honour'd in the Perſian Court.

Both Kings approv'd, and prais'd Me; but what I

Said then to one, let each Man here apply

As ſpoke t'himſelf; 'twas for that end I came.

Farewell: your liking let your hands proclame.

Exit Solon.

#### 3.1.4.

[[Page 147]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=80)

Enter Chilon.

MY Hips with ſitting, Eyes with ſeeing ake,

Expecting when Solon an End would make.

How little, and how long you Atticks prate!

Scarce in three hundred Lines one word of Weight,

Or a grave Sentence! how he lookt on me

At going off?—Now Spartan Chilon ſee!

Who with Laconian Brevity commends

To you the Knowledge of your ſelves, kind Frends!

[...], carv'd in Delphos Fane.

'Tis a hard Work, but recompenc'd with Gain.

Try your own ſtrength; examine what 'tis you

Have done already, what you ought to doe.

All Duties of our Life, as Modeſtie,

Honour, and Conſtancie, included be

In this; and Glory th' Idoll of theſe dayes.

I've ſaid: Farewell: I ſtay not for your Praiſe.

Exit▪

#### 3.1.5.

Enter Cleobulus.

I Cleobulus, though my Native Seat

Be a ſmall Iſle, am Author of a great

And glorious Sentence;  [...];

A Mean is beſt; You Sirs that ſit upon

The fourteen middle Benches next unto

Th' Orcheſtra, beſt may judge if this be true.

Your Nodd ſhows your Aſſent: We thank you; but

We ſhall proceed in Order: Was it not

Your Afer, (though a Man he of late Time is)

That ſaid once in this Place, Ut ne quid Nimis?

[[Page 148]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=81) And
hither does our  [...] aime.

The Dorick and the Latine mean the ſame.

In ſpeaking, being ſilent, or in ſleep,

In good Turns, or in bad, a mean ſtill keep.

In ſtudy, Labour, or what elſe ſo e'r.

I've ſaid: and that a Mean I keep, end here.

Exit▪

#### 3.1.6.

Enter Thales.

I'm Thales, who maintain (as Pindar ſings)

VVater to be th' originall of Things,

[...] me Ver­  [...] becauſe  [...]erfect in Original,  [...]ted.

And on the Stage (as thoſe before) am come

T' aſſert the Truth of my own Axiom.

Perhaps by ſome 't may be offenſive thought:

But not by thoſe by ſad experience taught.

[...], ſay we,

Be Surety, and be ſure a loſer be.

A thouſand Inſtances I could produce

To prove Repentance is the only uſe

That can be made of it, but that We here

Examples by their Names to cite, forbear.

Make your own Application, and conceive

The Damage, Men by this ſole Act receive.

Nor this our good Intention take amiſs.

You that like, clap, you that diſlike it, hiſs.

Exit.

#### 3.1.7.

Enter Bias.

I Am Priaenean Bias, who once taught

[...], That moſt men are naught.

[[Page 149]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=81) I wiſh
t' had been unſpoke; for Truth gains Hate.

But by bad Men, I meant Illitterate,

And thoſe who barbarouſly all Laws confound,

Religion, Juſtice; for within this Round

I ſee none but are good: believe all thoſe

Whom I proclame for bad amongſt your Foes:

Yet there is none ſo partially apply'd

To favour Vice but with the good will ſide:

VVhether he truly be ſuch, or would fain

Of a good man the Reputation gain:

The hated name of an ill Man, there's none

But flies: if y'are all good, your praiſe: I'm gone.

Exit.

#### 3.1.8.

Enter Pittacus.

I'm Pittacus, who once this Maxime penn'd,

[...], That's Time apprehend.

But by Time we meant Time in Seaſon, as,

In tempore veni is your Roman Phraſe.

And your own Comick Poet Terence, he,

Chief of all things makes opportunity,

Where Dromo comes unto Antiphila

I'th'nick of Time: conſider what I ſay,

And mark how many Inconvenience

Suſtain, for want of this ſole Providence!

But now 'tis more than Time we ſhould be gone;

Farewell: and give your Approbation.

Exit.

#### 3.1.9.

[[Page 150]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=82)

Enter Periander.

NOw on the Stage ſee Periander move!

He who once ſaid, and what he ſaid will prove

[...]. Thought is all in all.

Since him a perfect Agent we may call

Who firſt conſiders what he undergoes;

For we ſhould ſtill forecaſt▪ as Terence ſhows,

Th' Event of Buſineſs, whether good, or bad,

E'r w'undertake it: where may beſt be had

Conveniency for Planting, where to build,

When to wage War, and where to pitch a Field:

Nor unconſiderately take in hand

Or great or ſmall Things; for that makes a ſtand

In the free Progreſs of all new deſigns;

In which, there's nothing Policy injoyns

Like Conſultation; hence it is that they

Who uſe it not, Chance does, not Counſell, ſway.

But I retire; whilſt you with better Fate

Imploy your Thoughts how to uphold your State.

### 3.2. The Sentences of thoſe ſeven Sages, comprehended in as many
Septenaries.

#### 3.2.1. Bias Prieneus▪

VVHat's Man's chief good? a Mind that right doth know.

What's his chief Ill? Man, his own greateſt Foe.

Who's rich? he who's contented. Who poor? He

Who Covets. A Wives beſt Dowr? Chaſtity.

What VVoman's chaſte? whom Fame dares not belie.

[[Page 151]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=82) VVho's
the VViſe man? who can, but doth no Ill.

The Fool? He who cannot, yet hath the VVill.

#### 3.2.2. Pittacus Mitylenaeus.

NOne knows to ſpeak, who knows not to refrain.

'Fore many bad, one good Man's Praiſe retain.

He's mad who envies others happineſs.

So's he who joys in other Mens diſtreſs.

The Laws thou doſt impoſe, thy ſelf obey.

VVhen Times are proſperous ſtore of Friends provide:

VVhen they are bad, but in a few confide.

#### 3.2.3. Cleobulus Lindius.

THe more thou canſt, 'leſs wiſh to do. The ſpite

Of Fortune oft doth on the guiltleſs light.

None long is happy in Impiety.

In others much, nought in thy ſelf paſs by.

The good Man's Friend is ſtill the bad Man's Foe.

Our Father's merits want of their due Fame.

And oft our Childrens Portion is but ſhame.

#### 3.2.4. Beriander Corinthius.

DEcent and Profitable ne'r diſſent.

The happier Man ſtill the more Provident.

'Tis ill to wiſh, 'tis worſe to fear Death, we

Should make a Virtue of Neceſſity.

He who is fear'd by many, many feares.

VVhen Fortune's kind, dread thy advanced height:

And ſcorn to ſink yet when ſhe ſhows her ſpight.

[[Page 152]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=83)

#### 3.2.5. Solon Athenienſis.

LIfe then is happy, when 'tis conſummate.

VVed with thy like; Diſparity breeds hate,

Confer not Honours caſually. A friend

Convince in private, publikely commend.

'Tis more to be, than be made Noble far.

If Fates decrees are ſure, in vain We fly them;

If they are not, in vain We fear to try them.

#### 3.2.6. Chilo Lacedaemonius.

FEard by Inferious, nor by betters ſcorn'd

Let me not live. Oft of thy Death be warn'd,

And Health: Misfortunes, by thy own, defeat,

Or friends Advice. The good thou doſt, forget,

But that which thou receiv'ſt, remember ſtill.

Age that reſembles Youth doth gratefull come.

Youth that reſembles Age is burdenſome.

#### 3.2.7. Thales Mileſius.

ABout to ſin, thy ſelf, though none elſe, fear.

Life dies: the glory of a good Death, ne'r.

What thou intend'ſt to do, forbear to tell.

To fear what thou canſt not o'rcome's a Hell.

A juſt Reproof does good though from a Foe:

But a falſe Praiſe does harm, though from a Friend.

Nilnimium ſatis eſt bids us here end.

[[Page 153]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=83)

### 3.3. Amphion, or a City well ordered.  
Caſimer.

FOrraign Cuſtomes from your Land,

Thebans by fair Laws command:

And your good old Rites make known

Unto your own.

Piety your Temples grace;

Juſtice in your Courts have Place:

Truth, Peace, Love, in every Street

Each other meet.

Baniſh Vice, Walls guard not Crimes.

Vengeance o'r tall Bulwarks climbs:

O'reach Sin, A Nemeſis

Still waking is,

Truth reſembling craft, Profane

Thirſt of Empire, and of Gain,

Luxury: and idle  [...]aſe,

Baniſh all theſe.

Private Parſimony fill

The Publike Purſe: Arms only Steel

Know, and no more: Valour fights cold

In plunder'd Gold.

VVar, or Peace do you approve,

VVith united Forces move:

Courts which many Collumes rear

Their falls leſs fear.

[[Page 154]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=84)

Safer Courſe thoſe Pilots run

VVho obſerve more Stars than One.

Ships with double Anchors ty'd

Securer ride.

Strength united firm doth ſtand

Knit in an eternall Band:

But proud Subjects private hate

Ruins a State.

This as good Amphion ſings

To his Harps well-tuned ſtrings,

It's ſwift Streams clear Dirce ſtopt,

Cytheron hopt,

Stones did leap about the Plains,

Rocks did skip to hear his Strains,

And the Groves the Hills did crown

Came dancing down.

VVhen he ceas'd, the Rocks and VVood

Like a VVall about him ſtood;

VVherce fair Thebes, which ſeven Gates cloſe

Of Braſs, aroſe.

### 3.4. Vertue improv'd by ſuffering.

'TIs but the Body that blind Fortunes ſpight

Can chain to Earth; the nobler Soul doth ſlight

Her ſervill Bonds, and takes to Heaven her flight.

So through dark clouds Heaven lightens (whilſt the ſhade

[...]s as a foyl to its bright ſplendour made)

And Stars with greater Luſtre Night invade.

[[Page 155]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=84) So
ſparkle Flints when ſtrook; ſo Metals find

Hardneſs from hammering, and the cloſer bind:

So Flames increaſe the more ſuppreſt by VVind.

And as the Grindſtone to unpoliſ'd Steel

Gives Edge, and Luſtre: ſo my Mind, I feel

VVhetted, and glaz'd by Fortunes turning VVheel.

### 3.5. To Mr Stanley, on his unimitable Poems.

THe Stagirite, who Poeſie defines

An Imitation, had he read thy Lines,

And thy rich Fancy known, he would have then

Recall'd the learned Error of his Pen,

And have confeſt, in his convicted State,

Nought thoſe could equall, this would imitate;

VVhich from no forraign Supplement doth ſpring,

Nor any Stand, but its own Height, take VVing.

And but that We ſhould ſeem ſo to miſpriſe

The Influence of Charieſſa's Eyes,

VVe ſhould not think Love did theſe Flames inſpire,

Rather, that thou taught'ſt Love this noble Fire:

And, by a generous VVay thy hopes t' improve,

Shew'dſt her before thou didſt, how thou could'ſt love;

And the old, common Method didſt invert,

Firſt made her Miſtris of thy Brain, then Heart,

Some Phant'ſies growth may from their Subjects take,

Thine doth not Subjects find, but ſubjects make;

VVhoſe numerous ſtrains we vainly ſtrive to praiſe

'Leſs We could ours, high as thy Phant'ſie, raiſe.

[[Page 156]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=85) Large
Praiſe we might give ſome, with ſmall Expence

Of Wit, cry Excellent! how praiſe Excellence?

The Painters Fate is ours, his hand may grace,

Or take a bad, ſcarſe hit a beauteous Face.

Nor can our Art a ſitting value ſit

Upon thy noble Courteſie of Wit,

Which to ſo many Toungs doth lend that ſtore

Of pleaſing ſweetnes which they lack'd before.

Th' Iberian, Roman, and the fluent Greek;

The nimble French, and the ſmooth Thuſcan, ſeek

For ſeverall Graces from thy Pen alone,

Which that affoords to all theſe Toungs, in One.

Whoſe forraign Wealth transferr'd, improv'd by thine,

Doth with a fair Increaſe of Luſtre ſhine

Like Gems new ſet upon ſome richer Foyle,

Or Roſes planted in a better Soyle.

If 'bove all Lawrels then thy Merits riſe,

What can this Sprig (which while 'tis offer'd, dies)

Add to the Wreath that does adorn thy Brows?

No Bayes will ſuit with that but thy own Bowghs.

### 3.6. On his Tranſlation of Oronta.

FLames reſcu'd fair Oronta from the Pow'r

Of an inſulting Thracian Conquerour.

The Fame of which brave Action, Preti's Rime

Freed from the greater Tyranny of Time:

Yet in that Freedome ſhe leſſe glories, then

In being thus made Captive by thy Pen.

[[Page 157]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=85)

### 3.7. To Mr James Shirley, on his Way of Grammer explained in Engliſh
Verſe.

GRammer, which taught the Poet firſt to write,

Is by the Poet now taught to delight;

And Poeſy, which once unto the School

Ow'd it's Inſtructions, now, to that's a Rule.

Thy gratefull Pen, to Science does impart

Civility, and requites Art, with Art.

Yet not like ſome, who think they hardly ſhou'd

Be thought to underſtand, if underſtood,

Do'ſt thou the Minds of weaker Tiro's vex,

Or, as perplex'd with th' Art, the Art perplex;

But what e're ſeem'd therein obſcure, mak'ſt clear,

Brief, what prolix, ſmooth what did rough appear;

That ſo the Art to Learners now is ſeen

As in a Flat, which Hill, and Wood did skreen.

How ſhould they erre their Journey's end in view,

Their Way ſo pleaſing, and their Guide ſo true!

Reſt then ſecure of Fame; nor think thy Worth

Can by a private Hand be well ſet forth.

Attempts, which to the Publick Profit raiſe,

Expect, nor merit leſſe than Publick Praiſe.

[[Page 158]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=86)

### 3.8. In Idem, ad Eundem.

SHirleie, Angliacúm cui olim celeberime vatum!

Drama Labor Nomenque fuit; tibi nune novus ecquis

Surgit Honos? qualiſve alto ſubit Infulanexu

Tempora?—Nunc video: Magnos accinctus in uſus,

Carmine facundo tractas Pracepta ſeverae

Grammatices, Latiaeque canis Primordia linguae;

Ut meliùs teneros blandâ dulcedine captos

Afficeres animos, & dura Elementa colenti,

Atque rudi nimium, Eloquio, placitura Juventae

Efficeres: Labor, en multum meriturus honeſtae

Landis! non aliter (tua ſed magè mellea Lingua)

Tentavit Neſtor juv [...]lia fingere Corda,

Heroum teneras tam grato Carmine Mentes

Theſſalici haud rexit Moderator ſemifer Antri,

Grammatica exultet; vibretque Heliconia Ser [...]a,

Lande novâ florens: dulci nunc munere fand [...]

Provocet & Muſas: Decus hoc Shirleie dediſti.

FINIS.

## 4\. SACRA.

[[Page 161]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=87)

### 4.1. To the Eternall WISEDOME; Vpon the Diſtraction of the Times.

O Thou Eternall Mind! whoſe VViſedome ſees,

And rules our Changes by unchang'd Decrees,

As with Delight on thy grave Works We look,

Say; art thou too with our light Follies took?

For when thy bounteous Hand, in liberall Showres

Each where diffus'd, thy various Bleſſings powres;

VVe catch at them with ſtrife as vain to ſight,

As Children, when for Nuts they ſcrambling, fight.

This ſnatching at a Scepter breaks it; He,

That broken does e're he can graſpe it, ſee.

The poor World ſeeming like a Ball, that lights

Betwixt the hands of Pow'rfull Oppoſites:

VVhich while they cantonize in their bold Pride,

They but an Immateriall Point divide.

O whilſt for VVealthy Spoyles theſe fight, let Me,

Though poor, enjoy a happy Peace with Thee.

[[Page 162]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=88)

### 4.2. Draw Me, and I will follow Thee.

THrough devious Paths without thee, Lord! I run,

And ſoon, without Thee, will my Race be done.

Happy was Magdalen, who like a Bride,

Her ſelf to Thee by her fair Treſſes ty'd.

So ſhe thy Preſence never did decline,

Thou her dear Captive wert, and ſhe was Thine,

Behold another Magdalen in Me!

Then ſtay with Me, or draw me after Thee.

### 4.3. If a Man ſhould give all the ſubſtance of his Houſe for Love, he
would value it as nothing, Cant. 8.

LOve I'd of Heaven have bought; when He, (this who

VVould think?) both Purchaſe was, and Seller too.

I offer'd Gold; but Gold he did not prize.

I offer'd Gems; but Gems he did deſpiſe.

I offer'd All; All he refus'd yet: why,

If All wo'nt take, take what is left, ſaid I.

At this he ſmil'd, and ſaid; in vain divine

Love's Price thou beat'ſt; give nothing and ſhee's thine.

### 4.4. And they laid him in a Manger.

HAppy Cribb! that wert alone

To my God, Bed, Cradle, Throne,

VVhilſt thy glorious vileneſſe, I

View with divine Phant'ſies Eye;

[[Page 163]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=88) Sordid
filth ſeems all the Coſt,

State, and Splendour, Crowns doe boaſt.

See! Heaven's ſacred Majeſty

Humbled beneath Poverty.

Swadled up in homely Rags,

On a Bed of Straw and Flags.

He whoſe Hands the Heavens diſplayd,

And the VVorlds Foundations layd,

From the VVorld's almoſt exil'd,

Of all Ornaments deſpoyl'd.

Perfumes bath him not, new born,

Perſian Mantles hot adorn:

Nor do the rich Roofs look bright

VVith the Jaſpers Orient Light.

VVhere O Royall Infant! be

Th' Enſigns of thy Majeſtie?

Thy Sires equallizing State,

And thy Scepter that rules Fate?

VVhere's thy Angell-guarded Throne,

VVhence thy Laws thou didſt make known?

Laws which Heaven, Earth, Hell obay'd;

Theſe, ah theſe, aſide he layd;

VVould the Emblem be, of Pride

By Humility outvy'd.

### 4.5. On the Innocents ſlain by Herod.

GO bleſſed Innocents! and freely powre

Your Souls forth in a Purple ſhowre.

And for that little Earth each ſhall lay down

Purchaſe a Heavenly Crown.

[[Page 164]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=89) Nor of
Originall Pollution feare

The Stains ſhould to your blouds adhere;

For yours now ſhed, e're long ſhall in a Floud

Be waſh'd of better Bloud.

### 4.6. Chriſto Smarrito.

SIghing, her ſad Heart fraught with Fears,

Whilſt from her Eyes guſh ſtreams of Tears,

Seeking again how to retrive

Her little wandring Fugitive,

Each where with weary Steps doth rove,

The Virgin Mother of loſt Love.

Like a ſad Turtle, up and down

She mourning runs through all the Town:

With ſearching Eyes ſhe pries about

In every Creek; within, without.

Sticks at each Place, looks o're and ore;

Searches, where ſhe had ſearch'd before:

Old Joſeph following with ſad Face,

A heavy Heart, and halting Pace.

Thrice had the Day been born i'th' Eaſt,

As oft been buried in the Weſt,

Since the Dear Comfort of her Eyes

She miſs't; yet ſtill her Search ſhe plyes.

Each where ſhe ſeeks with anxious Care

To find him out, yet knows not where.

When the third Morn ſhe ſaw aroſe,

And yet no Beam of Hope diſcloſe;

Looking to Heaven, in theſe ſad Words

She vent to her full Grief affords.

O my dear God! Son of my Wombe!

My Joy, my Love, my Life, for whom

[[Page 165]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=89) Theſe
Tears I ſhed, on thee I call,

But oh! thou anſwer'ſt not at all.

For thee I ſearch, but cannot find thee:

Say (Dear!) what new Embraces bind thee?

What Heart, enamour'd on thy Eyes,

Enjoyes what Heaven to Me denies?

Daughters of Sion! you which ſtray

With nimble feet upon the Way,

I beg of you, (if you can tell,)

To ſhew we where my Love doth dwell:

Whoſe Beauty with Celeſtiall Rayes,

The Light of Paradiſe diſplayes.

Perhaps to you he is unknown;

Ah! if you wiſh to hear him ſhown,

I'l tell y'him: Snow her whiteneſs, ſeeks,

Vermilion, Bluſhes, from his Cheeks:

His Eye a light more chaſte diſcloſes

Then amorous Doves, his Lips then Roſes.

Amber, and Gold ſhine in his Hair

(If Gold, or Amber may compare

With that,) a Beauty ſo Divine,

No Tongue, Pen, Fant'ſie can deſign.

Why break'ſt thou not (my Soul) this Chain

Of Fleſh? why lett'ſt thou that reſtrain

Thy nimble Flight into his Arms,

VVhoſe only Look with gladneſs charms?

But (alas!) in vain I ſpeak to thee

Poor Soul! already fled from Me;

To ſeek out him in whoſe lov'd Breſt,

Thy Life, as mine in thee, doth reſt.

Bleſt Virgin! who in Tears half drown'd,

Griev'ſt that thy Son cannot be found.

The time will come when Men ſhall hear thee

Complain that he is too too near thee.

[[Page 166]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=90) When in
the midd'ſt of hoſtile Bands

With pierced Feet, and nailed Hands

Advanc'd upon a curſed Tree

His naked Body thou ſhalt ſee

As void of Coverture, as Friends,

But what kind Heaven in pitty lends,

Thy Soul will then abhor the Light,

And think no Grief worſe than his Sight.

But loe, as thus ſhe ſearch'd, and wept,

By chance ſhe to the Temple ſtept,

Where her dear Son with joyfull Eyes

Set 'mongſt the Rabbins ſhe eſpies.

And as the Light of ſome kind Star

To a diſtreſſed Marriner,

So his dear ſight to her appears,

Toſt in this Tempeſt of her Fears.

But O what tongue can now impart

The joy of her revived Heart?

The Welcome, ſpoke in mutuall Bliſſes

Of ſweet Embraces, ſweeter Kiſſes!

Muſe, ſince too high forthy weak Wing

[...]is, contemplate what thou canſt not ſing.

### 4.7. Chriſtus Mathaeum & diſcipulos alloquitur.

LEave, leave converted Publican! lay down

That ſinfull Traſh; which in thy happier Race

To gain a Heavenly Crown

Clogs thy free Pace.

O what for this pale durt will not Man do!

Nay even now, 'mongſt you

(For this) there's One I ſee,

Seeks to ſell Me.

[[Page 167]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=90) But
Times will come hereafter, when for Gold,

I ſhall by more (alas) than One, be ſold.

### 4.8. Conſcience.

INternall Cerberus! whoſe griping fangs

That gnaw the Soul are the Minds ſecret Pangs:

Thou greedy Vulture! that doſt gorging Tire

On Hearts corrupted by impure deſire.

Subtle, and buzzing Hornet! that doſt ring

A Peal of Horrour, e'r thou giv'ſt the ſting.

The Souls rough File that ſmoothneſs does impart!

The Hammer that does break a ſtony Heart!

The Worm that never dies! the Thorn within,

That pricks, and pains: the whip, and ſcourge of ſin!

The voice of God in Man! which, without reſt

Doth ſoftly cry within a troubled Breaſt;

To all Temptations is that Soul left free,

That makes not to it ſelf a Curb of Me.

### 4.9. And ſhe waſhed his Feet with her Teares, and wiped them with the
Hairs of her Head.

THe proud Aegyptian Queen, her Roman Gueſt,

(T' expreſs her Love in Hight of State, and Pleaſure)

With Pearl diſſolv'd in Gold, did feaſt,

Both Food, and Treaſure.

And now (dear Lord!) thy Lover, on the fair

And ſilver Tables of thy Feet, behold!

Pearl in her Tears, and in her Hair,

Offers thee Gold.

[[Page 168]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=91)

### 4.10. Good Fryday.

THis Day eternall Love, for me

Faſt nail'd unto a curſed Tree;

Rending his fleſhly Veyl, did through his ſide

A way to Paradiſe provide.

This Day Life dy'd; and dying, overthrew

Death, Sin, and Satan too;

O happy day!

May ſinners ſay:

But Day can it be ſaid to be,

Wherein We ſee

The bright Sun of celeſtiall Light

O'rſhadow'd with ſo black a Night?

### 4.11. Mary Magdalen weeping under the Croſs.

I Thirſt, my dear, and dying Saviour cryes:

Theſe Hills are dry: O drink then from my Eyes.

### 4.12. On the Receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament.

THen Nouriſhment our Naturall Food imparts,

When that into our Fleſh, and Blood converts:

But at this heavenly Banquet, I

Then find of ſtrength a ſpirituall ſupply,

When (as by Faith the ſacred Food I eat)

My Soul converts into the Meat.

[[Page 169]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=99509&page=91)

### 4.13. The Meſſage.

DEar Saviour! that my Love I might make known

To thee, I ſent more Meſſengers than one.

My heart went firſt, but came not back; My Will

I ſent thee next, and that ſtaid with thee ſtill.

Then, that the better thou might'ſt know my Mind,

I ſent my Int'lect; that too ſtaies behind.

Now my Soul's ſent: Lord! if that ſtay with thee,

O what a happy Carkaſs ſhall I be!

### 4.14. The Fountain.

STranger, who e'r thou art, that ſtoop'ſt to taſte

Theſe ſweeter ſtreams, let me arreſt thy haſte;

Nor of their fall

The Murmurs, (though the Lyre

Leſs ſweet be) ſtand t' admire:

But as you ſhall

See from this Marble Tun

The liquid Chriſtall run;

And mark withall,

How fixt the one abides,

How faſt the other glides;

Inſtructed thus the Difference learn to ſee,

'Twixt Mortall Life, and Immortality.

FINIS.
