# The London lads lamentation to Cupid. Or; VVhen shall I my true-love have?
All young men must to Cupids power submit, courage and wisdom, vertue too, &
wit: none can his mighty power & charm withstand he, like young beauty, always
will command: and here young maidens easily may find, how apt young-men are to
be true & kind such constancy in them could scarce be found should men go
search the universe all round. To an excellent new tune, sung at the court.

CLoes Face is Heav'n to me,

Like the Morning-Light we ſee;

And the Beauty of her Eye,

Bright and lovely, like the Sky:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Will young Love a Tyrant be?

Make me doat on Cruelty:

Why doth ſullen Fate confine

Me to one that is not mine?

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Had I Lov'd as others do,

Onely for an hour or two,

Then there had a Reaſon bin,

I ſhould ſuffer for my Sin:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Love (thou know'ſt) with what a flame,

I adore young Cloes Name:

Let me then thy pitty find,

Shoot a Dart and change her mind:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

All her Beauties do entice,

Though the Nymph be cold as Ice,

Roſie-Lips and Lilly-Skin,

All we gaze on, Charm and win:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

On her gentle Downy Breaſt,

Let a ſighing Lover reſt,

Twin'd within thoſe tender Arms,

Fetter'd by thoſe pleaſing Charms:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Let my Love with joys be Crown'd

You that with a Glance can Wound,

With a Melting Kiſs reſtore,

Your young Love that ſigh'd before:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Thus you'l ſhow your power and skill,

Able both to Save and Kill,

But to Kill has always bin

Held a moſt Notorious Sin:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

In ſweet Groves we'l always dwell,

With more joys than tongue can tell

There the Wanton then we'l play,

Steal each others heart away:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

You I love (by Jove) I do,

More then all things here below,

With a Paſſion full as great,

As e're Creature fancied yet:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Bid the Miſer leave his Ore,

Bid the Wretched ſigh no more:

Bid the Old be Young again,

Bid young Maids ne'r think of Men:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.

Love's not a thing of Chance, but Fat [...]

That makes me Love, that makes yo [...] hat [...]

Then if you be falſe or true,

Love I muſt, and none but you:

Cloe, ſince my Heav'n thou art,

Eaſe and cure my wounded heart.
