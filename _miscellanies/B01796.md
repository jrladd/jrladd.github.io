## 1\. BUMM-FODER OR, VVASTE-PAPER Proper to wipe the Nation's RƲMP with, or
your Own.

FRee quarter in the North is grown ſo ſcarce,

That Lambert with all his men of Mars

Have ſubmitted to kiſs the Parliaments Arſe,

Which no body can deny.

If this ſhould prove true, (as we do ſuppoſe)

Tis ſuch a wipe as the RUMP and all's Foes

Could never give to old Olivers noſe:

Which, &c.

Theres a Proverb come to my mind not unfit,

When the head ſhal ſee the RUMP all be-ſhit,

Sure this muſt prove a moſt lucky hit:

Which &c.

Theres another Proverb which every Noddy

Wil jeer the RUMP with, and cry Hoddy Doddy,

Here's a Parliament all Arſe and no Body.

Which &c.

Tis a likely matter the world wil mend

When ſo much blood and treaſure we ſpend,

And yet begin again at the wrong End:

Which &c.

We have been round and round about twirl'd,

And through much ſad confuſions hurl'd,

And now we are got into the arſe of the world:

Which &c.

But 'tis not all this our courage wil quail,

Or make the brave Seamen to the RUMP ſtrike ſail,

If we can have no head, we wil have no Tail:

Which &c.

Then let a Free-Parliamet be turnd trump,

And nere think any longer the Nation to mump

With your pocky, perjur'd, damnd, old Rump:

Which &c.

But what doth Rebel Rump make here

When their proper place (as Will. Pryn doth ſwear)

Is at the Devils arſe in Derbyſhire:

Which &c.

Then thither let us ſend them a tilt,

For if they ſtay longer, they wil us beguilt

With a Government that is looſe in the Hilt:

Which &c.

Youl find it ſet down in Harringtons Moddle,

Whoſe brains a Commonwealth do ſo coddle

That t'as made a Rotation in his noddle:

Which &c.

'Tis a pitiful paſs you men of the Sword

Have brought your ſelves to, that the Rumps your Lord,

And Arſie-Verſie, muſt be the word,

Which, &c.

Our powder and ſhot you did freely ſpend,

That the Head you might from the Body rend,

And now you are at us with the But-end,

VVhich; &c.

Old Martin and Scot have ſtill ſuch an itch,

That they will with the Rump try to'ther twitch;

And Lenthal can greaſe a fat Sow in the britch:

VVhich, &c.

Thats a thing that would pleaſe the Butchers and Cooks,

To ſee this ſtinking Rump quite off the hooks,

And Jack-Daw go to pot with the Rooks.

Which, &c.

This forward Sir John (who the Rump did never fail)

Againſt Charles Stuart, in a Speech did rail;

But men ſay it was without head or tail,

Which, &c.

Juſt ſuch is the Government wee live under,

Of Parliament thrice cut in ſunder;

And this hath made us the worlds wonder,

Which, &c.

Old Noll when we talk of Magna Charta,

Did prophecy well we ſhould all ſmart-a,

And now wee have found his RUMPS Magna Fart-a,

Which, &c.

But I can't think Monck (though a Souldier and ſloven)

To be kin to the Fiend, whoſe feet are cloven,

Nor will creep i'th Rumps Arſe, to bake in their Oven,

Which, &c.

Then ſince he is coming, e'ne let him come

From the North to the South, with Sword and Drum,

To beat up the quarters of this lewd Bum;

Which, &c.

And now of this Rump I'le ſay no more,

Nor had I begun, but upon this ſcore,

There was ſomething behind, which was not before;

Which, &c.

FINIS, in Engliſh The RƲMP.
