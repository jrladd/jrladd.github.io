## 1\. FORTUNATE RISING, OR THE RUMP UPWARD.

Good People, and you, that have been undone,

By Guns, and Drums, and the Trumpet's tone,

And new hard Words ſince Forty and One,

Which no body can deny.

Here is a word, that will plague you more

Then any, that ever went before,

'Tis The Rump of Harry Martin's Whore,

Which, &c.

The Cauſe was at firſt a pretty conceit

To create a durty Rebel great;

But now that has left th'imperial Seat,

VVhich, &c.

A General was a glorious Name,

Till Eſſex his Member ſpoil't it's Fame;

For a Souldier ought to be good at the Game,

VVhich, &c.

The Communication Line was a Jigge,

And as good as the Bath to make women bigge,

Who never were ſo, till they learnt to Digge,

Which, &c.

Artillery was a thundring word,

Where many appear'd with Musket and Sword

To fright poor Atkins out of a Turd,

Which, &c.

Cavalier was a name of as great a Force,

As Centaure, that is both Man and Horſe,

And for Raviſhing ſuffered many a curſe,

Which, &c.

Yet every woman, that had this fear,

Although in her heart a Roundhead ſhe were,

In her belly ſhe wiſht a Cavalier,

Which, &c.

Sequeſtration ſcar'd men out of their Plate,

Exciſe drew potent Ale out of date,

And the Corps de Garde broke many a pate,

Which, &c.

The Plunderers made men hide their money,

And women their jewels, if they had any;

And one there was, hid gold in her Cunny,

Which, &c.

A Commonwealth is a Citizens truſt,

And by his wife ador'd it muſt,

As a Topique to prove adultery juſt,

Which, &c.

The Protector ſtorm'd at all mankind,

Made Kings, and Princes walk behind,

Till the Divel out-ranted him in a wind,

Which, &c.

The Committee of Safety threw the Dye;

But ſomebody ſpit in his face from on high,

And made the valiant Fleetwood cry,

Which, &c:

But the RUMP is a word of ſuch a power,

Pronounc'd, your Beer, like Thunder, twill ſowr,

And after making you ſquitter an howr,

Which, &c.

The Squirting at EPSOM'S not worth a louſe,

RUMP outdoes all, that come there to carouſe;

For it ſhit from Portſmouth to Wallingford Houſe,

Which, &c.

If Booth were no Knave, a Fool let him be,

To keep ſuch a ſtir for Liberty,

When the Rump ſets all it's Tenant Free,

VVhich no body, &o.

He that could imitate ſounds in a Fart,

And ſpeak from behind with a wondrous Art,

Were the living now, ſhould take Lenthal's part,

VVhich no, &c.

And then a Fart for the City forces,

For Monk, that's comming with all his Horſes,

And a T— for Fairfax too, that worſe is,

Which, &c.

A Parſon once in a Frolick Divine

Exhauſted Glaſſes twenty and nine,

For Turkey's Rump in Canary Wine,

VVhich, &c.

And ſure he receiv'd a Revelation,

When to Preach he left his firſt Vocation,

That a Rump in time ſhould rule the Nation,

VVhich, &c.

Montelion's Diall's a droling Mock,

With a ſtick in the Country fellows Dock,

And fitter now then the Pallace Clock,

Which, &c.

Morlay, a joynt of the Rump, grew Big,

And ſwelling; but politique Haſilrigge,

Ha's ſent him for Phyſick to Doctor Trigge,

Which, &c.

Mad Vane was Anointed King, and ſaid,

He receiv'd a Crown that burden'd his Head,

For which the Rump ſent him home to Bed,

Which, &c.

The Abjuring Oath made the Speaker Sick,

Which Haſilrigge taking in the Nick,

For his fain'd one ſhow'd him a real Trick,

Which, &c.

Thus, what for aliment is unfit,

The Tayle by a vertue guiding it,

Excludes, and leaves it ſelf beſhit,

Which, &c.

Let no Man then pretend any Cauſe,

Againſt the Rump to open his Jawes,

For it Rules by the Fundamental Laws,

Which no body can deny.
