_[figure]_

COme Liſten to me, you Gallants ſo free,

All you that loves mirth for to hear,

And I will you tell of a bold Outlaw,

That lived in Nottingham-ſhire,

that lived in Nottingham-ſhire.

As Kobin Hood in the Forreſt ſtood,

All under the Green-wood tree,

There was he aware of a brave young man

As fine as fine might be,

as fine, &c.

The youngſter was cloathed in Scarlet red

In Scarlet fine and gay,

And he did frisk it over the plain,

And chanted a round delay,

and chanted, &c.

As Robin Hood next morning ſtood,

Amongſt the leaves ſo gay,

There did he eſpy the ſame young man

Come drooping along the way,

come drooping, &c.

The Scarlet he wore the day before,

It was clean caſt away,

And every ſtep he fetcht a ſigh,

Alack and a welladay,

alack, &c.

Then ſtepped forth brave little John,

And Nick the Millers Son,

Which made the young man bend his bow,

When as he ſee them come,

when as, &c.

Stand off, ſtand off, the young man ſaid,

What is your will with me,

You muſt come before our Maſter ſtraight,

Vnder you greenwood Tree,

under, &c.

And when he came hold Robin before

Robin askt him courteouſly,

O haſt thou any money to ſpare,

For my merry men and me,

for my, &c.

[[Page 395]](http://eebo.chadwyck.com/downloadtiff?vid=183519&page=1)

I have no money the young man ſaid,

But five ſhillings and a Ring,

And that I have kept this ſeven long years

To have it at my wedding,

to have, &c.

Yeſterday I ſhould have Married a Maid

But ſhe was from me  [...]ane,

And choſen to be an old Knights delight,

Whereby my poor heart is ſlain.

whereby, &c.

VVhat is thy name, then ſaid Robin Hood,

Come tell me without any fail,

By the faith of my body then ſaid the young­man

My name it is Allin a Dale,

my, name, &c.

What wilt thou give me ſaid Robin Hood,

In ready gold or fee,

To help thee to thy true Love again,

And deliver her unto thee:

and tel  [...]er, &c.

I have no money then quoth the young man

No ready gold nor fee,

But I will ſwear upon a book,

Thy true Servant for to be,

thy true, &c.

How many miles is it to thy true Love,

Come tell me without any guile,

By the faith of my body then ſaid the young man,

It is but five little mile,

it is, &c.

Then Robin he haſted over the plain,

He did neither ſtint nor lin,

Vntil he came unto the Church,

Where Allin ſhould keep his wedding.

where, &c.

What doſt thou here, the Biſhop then ſaid,

I prithee now tell unto me,

I am a bold Harper quoth Robin Hood,

And the beſt in the North Country,

and the, &c.

O welcome, O welcome the Biſhop he ſaid

That Muſick beſt pleaſeth me,

You ſhall have no Muſick quoth Robin Hood,

Till the Brids and the Bridsgroom I ſee,

till, &c.

VVith that came in a wealthy Knight,

VVhich was both grave and old,

And after him a finikin Laſs

Did ſhine like the gliſtring Gold;

did ſhine, &c.

This is not a fit match [...]d, bold Robin Hood

That you do ſeem to make here,

For ſince we are come unto the Church,

The bride ſhe ſhall chuſs her own Dear;

the, &c.

Then Robin Hood put his horn to his mouth

And blew bl [...]ſts two or three,

VVhen four and twenty bowmen bold

Came leaping over the Lee,

came leaping, &c.

And when they came into the Church yard,

Marching all on a row,

The firſt man was Allin a Dale,

To give bold Robin his bow,

to give, &c.

This is thy true Love Robin he ſaid,

Young Allin as I hear ſay,

And you ſhall be married at the ſame time,

Before we depart away,

before, &c.

That ſhall not be, the biſhop he ſaid,

For thy word ſhall not ſtand,

They ſhall be three times askt in the church

As the Law is of our Land,

o [...] the, &c.

Robin Hood pull'd off the biſhops coat,

And put it upon Little John,

By the faith of my body then Robin ſaid,

This cloath doth make thee a man,

this, &c.

When Little John went into the Quire,

The people began to laugh,

He askt them ſeven times in the Church,

Leſt three times ſhould not be enough,

leſt, &c.

VVho gives me this Maid, ſaid little John,

Quoth, Robin Hood that do I,

And he that both take her from Allin a Dale,

Full dearly he ſhall her buy,

full, &c.

And thus having ended this merry wedding

The Bride lookt like a Queen,

And ſo they return'd to the merry greenwood

Amongſt the leaves ſo green,

amongſt the leaves ſo green.
