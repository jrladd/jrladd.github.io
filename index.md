  I'm an Assistant Professor in Computing and Information Studies at <a href="https://www.washjeff.edu/programs/computing-and-information-studies-cis/" target="_blank">Washington & Jefferson College</a>, where I teach and research on the use of data across a wide variety of domains, especially in cultural and humanities contexts. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Digital Humanities at <a href="https://humanities.northwestern.edu/about/people/postdoctoral-fellows-here-program/index.html">Northwestern University</a>, where I worked on <a href="https://earlyprint.org" target="_blank">EarlyPrint</a>. Before that, I received my PhD in English from <a href="https://english.wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I use humanities approaches to data and network analysis to think about the long, interwoven histories of media and technology, especially in early modern literature. My current book project, <em>Network Poetics</em>, traces the history of early modern literary collaboration using social network analysis and argues that shifts in the networks of print production allowed for the emergence of new literary forms. I also work on the history of secret codes and mathematical forms in seventeenth-century literature.
